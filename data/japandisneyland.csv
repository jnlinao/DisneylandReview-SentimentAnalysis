0,Amazing!!!,My family & I visited Disney Sea in April 2019. As a family we truly loved it. The atmosphere was electric. The park was spotless. We found the staff to be incredibly friendly and very helpful. Language was not a problem.,"Written April 23, 2022",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1,Tokyo,Great place to spend time with young children. Take tons of pictures. Even adults can enjoy the visit too. You can also buy souvenirs for friends n family,"Written January 27, 2022",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2,Very little COVID measures,"When we got there, there was a huge line without any social distance just to enter the park. Over 500 people waiting on line without any extra space near the parking lot area.
Nobody asked to see our vaccination passports and the ""health check"" was a mere temperature check.
All annoucements were in Japanese, and they just yelled as if it had been a countryside fair or something. I am fluent in Japanese, and despite the fact I asked the staff questions in Japanese, they would just refuse to listen to the questions and walk away. This happened several times while inside as well.

I only saw sanitizing stations at the entrance of attractions and toilets. Nothing by the popcorn kioks.
There were lines for everything, and it was overcrowded.

Don't waste your money going there because everything is just a neverending row of window-dressing procedures. For instance, we were kicked out of a parade-watching area because the clerk wasn't happy with the place we had sat on‚Äîdespite the fact another clerk had said earlier we could sit there in both English and Japanese. The woman that kicked us out just yelled in broken English and didn't even try in Japanese.

Food was also subpar. We had lunch at the restaurant near Splash Mountain, and the food was cold. Flavorwise, the food was good, but cold.

We got tickets that were almost ¬•9,000 (roughly $85 dollars) just to be told that there were no tickets to access the Beauty and the Beast attraction. When I asked, the staff just repeated like echo pedals, the favorites Japanese phrase ""Áî≥„ÅóË®≥„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì/I'm sorry"" as if that solved anything.
Tokyo Disneyland has been the worst so far. Very little carw about customers, excessive yelling, and lines for everything.
Don't waste your money and go to Hong Kong Disneyland instead; the staff there are more welcoming and you won't need near-native Japanese to enjoy rides (the narration is only in Japanese, and there isn't even a chance to understand what is happening when you aren't fluent in the language). Clerks don't even try. They just vomit Japanese at full speed, and if you don't catch it, they just ignore you and use pointing.

I would not recommend it to anyone, actually not until COVID is over because without measures, itat too risky. Their measures are window-dressing, just to do well statistically. In reality nobody gave a damn about distance, and when you enforced it, people would cut in line.","Written December 24, 2021",2.0 of 5 bubbles
3,Not what it used to be...,"Nowhere what it used to be. Have been going for more than 30 years and it seems to be all about pinching the penny these days. You can no longer ride the major attractions more than once (Soaring, Toy Story). The all you can eat restaurants are gone. The food prices have gone up and the portions haven gotten smaller. They have cut off Wifi in some restaurants to increase table turnovers - which is not a bad idea, but some folks like a little Wifi while eating. Tickets are almost impossible to get. The ticket scalping has gotten out of control - I believe they are working on this now. The new attractions have been disasters. Closing down 'day at the races' and replacing it with Beauty and the Beast is a Big, BIG BIG mistake. They should have gone EV. The attractions are not going full tilt. They lie and tell you that they are doing maintenance. The stock may be going up and up but the park itself is going down and down. Maybe this is the sign of the times. Disney used to have great value, now it is just someplace like a park where you walk around in circles taking in smells and scenery - sort of VR ish. I don't mind paying more for value but it is not here. You are paying more for mediocre business decisions. This is entertainment and using the Covid as an excuse to take everything away while increasing prices will eventually make folks reevaluate Universal Studios. Come on DISNEY, wake up.","Written December 16, 2021",3.0 of 5 bubbles

7,Happiest place on earth!,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland few months before the pandemic started and so far, it's the best theme park that I visited.

I endured long queues and it's worth it as their attractions are really amazing and entertaining.

The park parades are awesome!

Tokyo Disneyland‚Äôs highlight of the night where fireworks display gives bright colors to the evening sky. It‚Äôs a musical show perfect to end the night with a smile. It seems though that the fireworks are outside the premises of Disneyland however this gives a night to remember.

10,Great as expected!,"Glad to visit! ... not so many people on Sunday 4th, 2021. Only 10-30 mins waiting time. But I felt both standby pass and entry request weren‚Äôt effective at all. The attractions which needed standby passes were super-crowded at the standby passes times and were completely barren at the rest of the day. I could get 4 or 5 (attractions and entry requests in total). And by noon all attractions and rides....etc. were unavailable. So in my opinion, this new system wasn‚Äôt made for COVID-19. In addition, using smartphones and APP at the park for mostly all the day made me so busy that I couldn‚Äôt fully enjoy with my family.","Written April 4, 2021",5.0 of 5 bubbles
11,Day After Engagement,"My fiance, her best friend and I went here the day after we got engaged during our 13 day trip through Japan. We went early on a Monday, November 4th but it was still packed.

My pro tip is to purchase your tickets from the 7/11. You can use the ticket/coupon machine near the front to purchase. Their is a YouTube video that explains in detail if you have trouble.

Also, most kids leave by 8/8:30 giving you about an hour and a half of little to no lines while waiting. If pressed for time, just got later in the day.

13,Racial Discrimination,"I brought my daughter to Tokyo Disneyland. Although this was not our first visit, it was however, our first attempt to wanting to take a picture with the mascots, in particular, Cinderella‚Äôs Fairy God Mother.

Never In my wildest dream did I expect racial discrimination from the well known and loved Japanese hospitality.

The Fairy God Mother and her attendants literally bypassed us when it came to our turn after queueing. Not once, but throughout the entire allocated time, only picking the Japanese guests.
We were thoroughly shocked and traumatised by this outright display of discrimination.

The representatives had shattered a child‚Äôs dream of a kind fairy god mother and the image of Disneyland, where dreams come true in the Land of Happiness. It was simply heartbreaking.

I was trained in the service industry with a Japanese Airline previously as cabin crew, and I understand fully well the importance of customer satisfaction in the Japanese context.
Disneyland Tokyo totally lacked professionalism in this aspect.

This incident had been extremely disappointing and had left us with a very bitter aftertaste.","Written October 16, 2020",1.0 of 5 bubbles
14,As good as the real thing,"We have been to the Disney park in USA and I have to say, we enjoyed this just as much. All the rides are also duplicates of the American rides. Rollocaosters galore, and great live entertainment. Very fun.","Written October 5, 2020",4.0 of 5 bubbles
15,Indeed the Happiest Place on Earth!,"Both kids and adults will love this place! I didn‚Äôt think I will enjoy as much as I did! I was even a little bit emotional, nearly cried(tears of Joy!) when the parade started! Haha! The lights parade was amazing! We traveled in Dec 2019 and I‚Äôm just writing this review now so I actually don‚Äôt remember the rides that we took but I still remember the joyful feeling. Even just strolling the place was great! ‚ù§Ô∏è

The only downside when we were there is that the Disney castle was closed. So that‚Äôs sad but overall still a great experience!","Written September 14, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles
16,It‚Äôs a small world,"The overall experience is what you can expect from Disneyland parks except a few things...
First - impossible to buy a ticket online of you don‚Äôt own a japanese bank card. We live in Japan right now but own a french bank card (VISA). Contacted the customer service, but no solution was proposed and we had to contact a ticket booker and pay more to get tickets. Surprising as it‚Äôs Disneyland.

During our day in the park, we had some weird experiences. When in lines, we constantly got interupted by staff asking to stay on floor marks to respect social distancing (we were respecting social distancing and it was obviously meant to make us feel uncomfortable...).

In the haunted mansion, I stopped just a few seconds in the stretch room to have a quick look at the decor. Immediately, the staff lady ran to me and asked me to move away and to keep walking. (Making the ¬´ move away ¬ª gesture with her hands). As if I was doing something really really bad.

Same happened in Big thunder moutain.

At night, during the parade, as we got closer to the show, a staff lady in charge of social distancing stopped us (she litteraly blocked me by standing before me). Only us. When I asked why. She answered ¬´ please stop ¬ª. I asked again. She answered ¬´ social distancing ¬ª. People were keeping on passing by / watching the show but us two had to walk back. No effort were made to communicate in simple japanese or english...

I am more than concerned and thankful for all the work they are doing right now with the covid situation. But it shouldn‚Äôt allow weird / unfair behaviors that make us feel as bad or very rude people... Anyway, that‚Äôs the first time in my life I feel embarrassed in a disneyland park.

It‚Äôs a small world after all - but behave with caution if you are a foreigner right now (and even if it‚Äôs your birthday üëçüèª)","Written September 10, 2020",3.0 of 5 bubbles
17,Bigger Scale Version of California's Disneyland,"All the things you love about US Disneyland, but BIGGER. I definitely felt like I could find my way around because I'm familiar with California's park. But Tokyo Disneyland does everything bigger. I love the Nostalgia of the old Country Bear Jamboree show still existing, the Swiss Family Robsinson tree still intact, the Cinderella version of the Castle. All the buidlings, walkways, lands are just larger, more updated. It's a fantastic park, and easy access from DisneySea.","Written September 3, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles

20,Not for foreigners,"We went there on a Wednesday it was still too crowded filled with students and Japanese youth. Could not find any shows in English language. I know we‚Äôre in Japan but being a tourist attraction they should have considered this. We barely saw characters going around the park for meet and greet . It was difficult to communicate with the staff and sometimes they would just shoo you away if they couldn‚Äôt understand you. You would see a lot of families with their poor kids crying because of the long lines and unacceptable number of people around the park. I went to Disney world a couple of times, lots of people, long lines as well but not to the point that you couldn‚Äôt find anywhere or any rides to go to. Tokyo Disneyland was a crowded mess. Also, the main castle was on renovation. Not too much rides for the amount people that they let in. It‚Äôs just not meant for foreigners especially with kids because you will just end up frustrated. The light show in the end was spectacular, it was the only nice thing that ever happened while we were there.","Written April 20, 2020",1.0 of 5 bubbles

22,Park is closed - cannot contact Disney for refund,I bought tickets for our holiday and then the park closed it's doors. I have been unable to get in contact with Disneyland Tokyo for weeks now after sending emails and calling. I am due a refund but have no idea if/how/when this will happen.

23,Horrible communication,"We bought 3 day passports tickets earlier in February for March. When Disney closed we tried to get the refund. No email sent to guests who booked already, nothing on the website. They announce everyday day that a web form will be available soon but keep pushing the date foward. It will be soon 1 month since they closed and still no possibility to get refund, the lack of communication for such a big company is really disappointing.","Written March 20, 2020",1.0 of 5 bubbles
24,Great but CROWDED,"Tokyo Disneyland is amazing, though very CROWDED. My wife and I are huge Disney fans and have gone to Disneyland in LA (about once/year), Disneyworld, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland, and Tokyo Disneyland is definitely one of the best.

While it‚Äôs INCREDIBLY CROWDED, the Japanese culture and people are so polite that it makes the (horrible) experience of standing in line much less horrible, stressful and annoying.

The food at Tokyo Disneyland is also WAY better than any of the other Disneyland parks by far! If you like Japanese curry, definitely eat at the Bear Country restaurant. It‚Äôs really good!

Another thing I found interesting is that people are really into popcorn at Tokyo Disneyland. I too am a HUGE popcorn fan and absolutely love it, though I didn‚Äôt find their popcorn to be that great. (10/2018)","Written March 18, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles

28,Wonderful Memories!,"Tokyo Disneyland has to be the happiest theme park I have been, possibly also because we were there during Christmas Day.

You will be surprised that visitors actually started queueing at the entrance before 7am(opens at 8am). We didn‚Äôt queue up because we had the early entry ticket from Disneyland Hotel that allowed us to join a much shorter queue. The normal queue was so long by 7.30am that it actually looked like some zombie movies where the zombies were waiting to rush into the park!

The place is really big and the mood was really awesome. Everyone was in Christmas mood and there was a huge Christmas tree greeting us at the entrance. We spent 1.5 days at Disneyland and enjoyed most of our rides.

Fast passes are important because of the crowd and I definitely encourage the using of fast passes else you will probably only enjoy just a couple of rides in a day ( average queue of good rides are all between 2-3hours without fast passes).
It is important to read in advance and plan your route/rides to make the most out of it. There are also real time apps to advise on queue timing so that you don‚Äôt have to walk all the way the ride to realise that it is shut down temporarily.

There are rides for everyone; from child-friendly, fun rides to exciting roller coasters. The parades are also very nice and both adults and children enjoyed so much. We missed the fireworks because we were in a ride and heard that it was super beautiful.

Overall it was a very fun experience and I will definitely recommend this!","Written March 2, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The park is very big but not too big, in my opinion perfect size for the majority of people to visit (teens, kids, young adults).

32,the happiest on earth Japanese style.,"All the horror stories I read were not true. It might be because of the travel is down because of the corone virus. No crowds the longest wait for a ride we wanted to go on is 45 minutes. The employees are the greatest I have ever seen at an amusement part. They seem to be geniunely friendly, not forced friendly like other places. Most know english or try to speak some english. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of t-shirts and none available had japanese charecters, just english. Also no magnets or antenna balls. I understand that Americans are not their bread and butter here, but it would be cool to get a shirt in Japanese. It was fun to wave at people while on the rides. I did notice they camp out early for the parades.","Written February 22, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles

35,"Busy, but a lot of fun...!","We were expecting it to be quiet on a Wednesday during school term but the place was pretty busy, with queues of over an hour on the bigger rides.

However, plenty of the rides had short queues, the parade we saw was fantastic, the sun shone and it was altogether a great day out.

The park is only 20 minutes on the train from Tokyo station in the center of the city so it is very easy to access.

Loads of guests had made the effort to dress up for the day, which added to the occasion.

On the downside, the towers on the main palace are covered in scaffolding and a new attraction - beauty and the beast, which looked spectacular - is not yet open.

An excellent and reasonable value day out...","Written February 19, 2020",4.0 of 5 bubbles
36,You need to be prepared...,"We visited this park and Disney Sea at one of the most off-peak times of the year. Overall we enjoyed ourselves but feel like we weren‚Äôt prepared enough and didn‚Äôt get the most out of it. Some points which are hopefully helpful:

Disney Sea is by far the better themed of the two parks. It has been incredibly well done and has to be the most impressive park in the world. Just being there is an enjoyment, even without going on the rides. Disneyland is basically a copy of the original park with some minor differences (Main Street is really disappointing!).

Crowds are huge! If you think the American parks are crowded then come here and see what crowded really means. We arrived 30 minutes before opening time at Disney Sea on a Thursday (not during holidays) and didn‚Äôt even get through the gates for 50 minutes. Be prepared for this as we spent 3 days at the parks and it wasn‚Äôt until the last day that we felt we weren‚Äôt a bit overwhelmed by it. You‚Äôve just got to go with it and except that patience is key!

On a similar note, get there early. The first half an hour is key to having a good day because you can quickly grab a FASTPASS for one of the headliners and get in line for another one. Within half an hour of opening time virtually all the headliners have queues in excess of 100 minutes (again - we were there off-peak) with soarin well over 3 hours, and fastpasses for some are either late into the evening or have already run out.

Regarding the shows - lotteries are run for the popular ones and you can‚Äôt access them without ‚Äòwinning‚Äô. Whilst this seems fair in principle, the reality is that you could spend all that money on tickets and see absolutely nothing whilst someone else sees everything that want. We were there for 3 days and entered all available lotteries. On our last attempt we managed to snag tickets but were pretty annoyed about it by this point. Apparently if you enter lotteries for a show just before they close it might make it more likely to get tickets.

Finally, we found the food to be terrible and a real let down. The snacks were fun and different, but main meals were both very expensive and incredibly small. As an example, ¬£12 for a (small) slice of pizza with a drink is the kind of thing you‚Äôre looking it. If it‚Äôs possible to pop out of the park at lunchtime to head back to the shopping centre at the station then this is highly recommended.

Overall we enjoyed our time in Disney and the rating is based on that but in all honesty I can‚Äôt see it being fun at all at peak times. If you are only able to visit one of the parks then make it Disney Sea because Disneyland can be found at all the other locations (with half the queues!). The main points are that you need to plan properly for your trip to get the most out of it and that you need to get there super early in the morning.","Written February 16, 2020",4.0 of 5 bubbles
37,Lovely theme park,"Similar to the USA and Paris one this one has a japanese flavour to it. Monsters go Seek is unique to Japan. Unlike Disneysea it's more for kids but still a great place to go for a day. Although some of the attractions are the same, the Japanese are very creative and take innovative ideas to the next level. Queues aren't as long as Disneysea but can still be couple of hours.
The park is still lovely for fairy tale attractions and definitely Instagramable. But we are happy we did this as part of our Japan itinerary

But I would say if you only have a day at Disney go for Disneysea.","Written February 15, 2020",4.0 of 5 bubbles
38,Disappointed,"Fast pass system was a joke, it only allows you to use it once every 2hours. No maps provided on entry and parades throughout the day made it difficult to get to and from attractions. Variety of food was limited and any decent ride had a wait time of usually between 80 a 100 minutes. Staff were friendly and helpful. Possibly worth it if you have children up to 8yo, otherwise save your money.

Tower of terror was by far the best and that was quite quick. Stood in line for two hours for the indiana Jones ride and I can safely say it was the biggest waste of time ever.

44,"Expensive, crowded but needed to ride the Star Wars ride so was worth it","Ok, so we went as family of four with two teenage boys and OMG, we went in Winter so god only knows how crowded this place would be in warmer weather, we did a four day pass to give a day here, a day in Disney Sea and then either park for the other two days, unfortunately we picked Wed, Thurs, Fri and Saturday and the Thursday turned out to be a Public holiday although the Saturday was worse. However even on a normal week day in middle of winter this place was packed and you can not even think about getting a go on everything. The line up to buy a Churro was 20mins, I'm not joking. And woman be prepared for long toilet queues. We were happy to find wait times around an hour but just didn't bother for the rides with two hour times.
Disneyland and Disneysea had always been something we wanted to do and as a Star wars fan I got my value from just that ride, but although I've been to Universal Studios many many times in Singapore, I definitely won't go back here, just far too many people. I imagine locals with an annual pass are ok as they can go there for one ride. But not a place to get value from as a tourists.","Written January 29, 2020",3.0 of 5 bubbles

46,Typical Disney,"We went with our son and daughter in law during a recent visit to Japan and we weren't disappointed.
There was a long queue for entry with many lining up more than 90 mins before opening. Once through the gates I would advise trying to get a fast pass if there is a particular ride you want to go on or you may find you spend a lot of your day queueing up to get on. Waiting time for some of the more popular rides was over 2 hours
As in most Disney's there's a wide variety of food available with a relatively short waiting time for service. The exception to this is the American Waffle House, we went for breakfast as soon as it opened and found ourselves at the head of a long queue that did not get any shorter throughout the day.

47,Japan does it better,"I've been to Tokyo Disney Resort (TDR) several times now and these are my favorite Disney parks. TDR is not run by Disney, but by the Oriental Land Co., and this is probably a contributing factor. A definite Japanese spin on park management.

A few things to note right out of the gate. Plan, plan, plan. If you want to get on all the rides, try to be there before rope drop. Figure out what rides you want to go on first - aim for big ticket items (Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain), get a fast pass for one then sprint like an Olympian to another and get in line. Your first 60 minutes should be a frenzy round.

Be warned, the Japanese park-goers do not mess around with fastpasses. Big ticket rides can have their FP's wiped out within a couple hours on a medium capacity day.

If you can, stay the night and / or purchase a vacation package (lots of extra inclusions like fast passes and show tickets) which really help in getting the most out of the day(s).

Make sure you check the schedule if you want to see shows or meet characters, because the lines start early and get long. Ride maintenance is posted online clearly in advance, so take a look at that beforehand to make sure anything you want to see will be open. TDR takes ride safety very seriously, so there are always rides closed for maintenance.

Something I've really noticed here is how popular these parks are with adults. If you're with a group of friends or solo it doesn't feel weird to be there without kids. It doesn't feel so ""family fun time only"" as some US parks do, Tokyo Disney is for ALL ages. It's also quite a popular thing for groups of friends to wear matching outfits...literally identical items of clothing, it's pretty cute.

If you plan it right, 1 day at Disneyland and 1 day at DisneySea should be enough. There are different ticketing options available, take a look on the website. Try to avoid going on weekends, Tokyo Disney is considered ""a locals park"". High rate of annual pass users who live locally, this means weekends, public holidays and school holidays are crazy busy. Outside of those times you likely won't need to buy a ticket in advance as long as you are there for opening.

If you plan on dining at a table service restaurant (Blue Bayou etc), then you need to book in advance, these bookings open 30 days out.","Written January 22, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles

49,Magical day in Disneyland,"We were there on a 2nd week of December 2019. Took about an hour train ride to reach Maihama station, collect our tickets and headed to the entrance. Despite it was a Tuesday, there were lot of people headed to Disneyland (or Disneysea), tourists and local alike.
We headed to the Tomorrowland first, managed to get fast tickets to 'Monster Inc' while we ride on the Star Tours. Space Mountain was closed while we were there. We managed to catch the Christmas Parade at 10.30, ate our lunch and waited for the Dreamin Up Parade at 1.20pm and the Night 'Dreamlights' Parade too. (Tip: get a seat 1 hour before the Parade starts).
We didn't have luck on the Lottery for both the Shows (located in Tomorrowland), hence we skipped those. We queue up for the Dumbo Ride in Fantasyland and managed to ride on Big Thunder Mountain (about 40-45 minutes queue) and went for rides with less queues; Toon Park, Island raft, Treehouse, Western Railroad, Pirates of the Carribean. Towards late afternoon, we noticed the groups of tourists had left, we went back to Tomorrowland and ride on Buzzlightyear with lesser queue.
After the Parade, we managed to stay for the fireworks far left from the castle-with-no-sphere-and-under-refurbishment.)
All in all, we were filled with Disney vibe to the brim, especially so for my youngest boy, his first Disneyland trip!","Written January 22, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles

For those who be able to plan for 2 whole days to both parks is fantastic! If you have limited time, after 6 pm ticket will allow you to complete both parks even on 1 day. Therefore we would recommend you for 2 days plan. As our trip this time quite tight, we plan after6 ticket for Disneyland 1 day and a full whole day ticket for DisneySea.
The evening ticket allow you to complete plenty of rides as shorter queue than day time and we really had a great time at Disney every single time visit. Please have fun and enjoy your time there. Cheers!","Written January 20, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles
52,I wish I could enjoyed much more,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland recently and to be honest I was very disappointed. It¬¥s so different from every other Disney. Long lines to buy popcorn for instance could be easily solved by installing more popcorn spots around the park.... so much empty space to be used (something that I was simply astonished ....how much money they are just not making). And they could also be more prepared and have more employees with English skills, they try very hard but sometimes the communication is not easy at all. And this is not what you expect when you go Disney.","Written January 17, 2020",2.0 of 5 bubbles
53,Charming Disneyland,"This is my third visit to a Disney franchise, with Shanghai and Hong Kong being the two other Disneyland. The feeling of visiting the park is always mesmerising and surreal. The wait to take the rides were long (ie. 45min) but that‚Äôs to be expected at any Disneyland. We just have to be smart about using the fastpass. One minor challenge that one might face when visiting:-

Most of the rides‚Äô narration are in Japanese. I am fine with that and am not ethnocentrically trying to insists that Tokyo Disneyland must cater to the English-speaking market. But it‚Äôll be nice if they had.","Written January 14, 2020",4.0 of 5 bubbles
54,The usual Disney Magic,"We chose Disneyland to go to over Disney Sea as we wanted the traditional Disney experience (not enough time to do both).

The park is a little smaller than the one in LA which is not a bad thing. We also carefully chose which day to go by looking at the various crowd heat maps available and for once it appeared spot on. Also check which rides and attractions are closed - this also helped us to decide to do Disneyland as DisneySea did have some major ride closures on the day we were looking at.

We arrived an hour before opening and there was already a very long queue to get in. We managed our fast passes very efficiently throughout the day and were intrigued by the amount of parades and shows the park has but also with the amount of people who queue and wait for hours for these parades and shows (great if you like rides!)

Tips:
1. Try and go straight to Poohs Honey Hut and get a fast pass or if you‚Äôre quick enough go straight on the ride. No other Disney has this ride and even as an adult, I thought it was fantastic.

2. Stay as late as you can. That last hour between 9pm and 10pm, we just went straight on a number of rides.

3. Belles Castle is opening April 2020. We saw some of the construction and this new part of the park is going to draw in the crowds for sure. We would love to come back and see this some day.","Written January 11, 2020",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Love it so much since not many crowd and the waiting time is very short but just hate it when we visited it was raining.

But gotta love tokyo disneyland which its hospitality staff and the rides too.
The food also good taste not like on other theme park.

57,Caters mainly to the Japanese crowd,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland in the evening. The rides were fun, staff were generally helpful but at times strange/ uncomfortable. Many can't speak English and nod their heads with a smile and laugh which only makes it weird. I found the place lacked soul (of disney cartoons) in general. Visually it brought back childhood memories but I couldn't get absorbed in it because it's mainly tailored to the Japanese people. I'd advise visitors to try their evening pass to get a good glimpse before visiting for the entire day. They should rename the place to something else, not Disneyland. Good visuals overall though. There was some construction/ repair work going on when I visited in December.

60,200+ minutes waiting for EACH main attractions,"This was the third Disneyland I had been to, the layout is very similar to the Orlando one. However, the management of the facilities is an absolute disaster.
.
There is a website which predicts the busy-ness of each day. We deliberately chose the one which meant to be less busy to avoid huge crowds. I was aware of the option to get a FastPass, however, by 10 am all fast passes were already given away and we managed only to get one for the Star Wars for 6 pm. This ride was very similar to the one at the other Disneyland and to be fair the attractions themselves very good. If you only could access them.
.
By 10:30 am the facility was so much crowded, so you could not really distinct if you were in a queue or just walking around. There were 150-200+ minutes queues outside each main attraction, even before you get inside for another queue. Some of them were 10 people deep, which made it literally a huge crowd standing on each other's heads.
.
Both in Florida and Paris, you could see plenty of characters walking around, most of the time, you could take pictures with them straight away. In Disneyland Tokyo, we had to queue for 75 minutes to take a picture with Mickey! The staff was rushing everyone and only one picture for the group was allowed. Bizarre.

30 minutes wait for the ladies toilet;
25 for the popcorn;
local food place was so busy, so people were standing behind the chairs waiting for the others to finish their meals, so they could finally have some dining space;
.
Splash Mountain 180-200 minutes waiting;
Big Thunder Mountain 180 minutes;
Pooh's Hunny Hunt 180 minutes;
Monsters Inc 150 minutes.
.
People were sitting on the cold concrete for an hour to observe the parade. The staff could not properly explain in English where and how you could meet the characters. I would expect them to speak at least better English, considering how international this attraction is.
.
On top of everything else, the main castle was covered in scaffoldings, which made pictures look ugly.

Personally, I would very much question the safety and security procedures of this place. I don't see how they would be able to evacuate all those people should such necessity arises.

Very much keen to ask Disney for the whole refund for such terrible experience.","Written January 4, 2020",1.0 of 5 bubbles

We all had a good time there, despite the long Q and in the cold.

Study the map (online) first, then arrive early, say around 7:30am, joined the Q.

Target the ride you like most, get a FAST PASS by scanning your ticket. Machine will spit out a small piece of paper telling you to return at certain time.

Go Q for another ride, then come back to the ride (where you have the FAST PASS) and enjoy the much shorter Q.

That way, one will have chance to do more rides. Time interval between FAST PASS is one hour, I think.

Bring bottle, to refill water FOC in the park.
Bring some little snacks eg biscuits, sandwiches, to save some money and time on Q for food.
Bring money to buy merchandise (we targetted those found only in Tokyo).

Toilet, clean.

Be sure to maximize the Fastpass options, even if they are few and far between - expect to wait in lines and only get a few attractions in per day, if you're here during peak times.

65,A nice atmosphere but some issues,"My friends and I (who are all 23/4) came to Disneyland on the 2nd Jan. Here‚Äôs just some quick pros and cons

Pros:
- Bear ride / attraction was really fun even for English speakers (a surprising amount of English songs) and just hilariously ridiculous
- Food was pretty good all round (we tried a lot of different places including Pizza Rays and the Tomorrowland Terrace)
-Scenery is nice
-The few rides we managed to get on were good!

Cons:
-The first few rides we went on we realised they put single riders into 2/3 capacity carts often. When there‚Äôs a 40 minute wait for a 2 minute ride is that really a good idea?
-The parades are ridiculous. Every time there is a parade (which is VERY often) you are screamed at to walk in single file across the park and cannot stand stationary. You cannot leave some restaurants during this 20 minute parade....with everyone literally elbow to elbow in the park it was absolute chaos and very, very annoying
-Only one fastpass every three or four hours or so which they don‚Äôt make clear so make sure you get the fastpass for the ride you want!!
-Not nearly enough toilets. Queued maybe 30 minutes sometimes
-In the restaurants getting a table is very hard. Make sure you get one before you buy food or your food will get cold as you stand and search!
-Plasma Rays had a huge wait to order!
-Overall we were at the park close to open and only managed to get on 5 rides due to wait times. We knew it would be busy but certainly not that busy! Definitely don‚Äôt go in this holiday period!

Overall exactly what you‚Äôd expect of Disney with some improvements needed for peak periods. In jan wouldn‚Äôt recommend going unless you‚Äôre SUPER keen.","Written January 2, 2020",4.0 of 5 bubbles

We then went for food and saw the lines of 100's at each place to buy food.......as for the toilets there was even at least a 30 minute wait to go there if you were a male and the womens line was twice the size.

The first is that lines for popcorn are longer than most rides as popcorn is life in Japan and the buckets are collectibles. Secondly lines for food are also extremely long so it‚Äôs recommended you bring snacks or find snack lines that are short, the snacks in the park are amazing!!! The park is beautiful fun and easy to traverse, highly recommend if you are a Disney fan.","Written January 2, 2020",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The attractions were OK but far from the best one we have been in before. There were not enough entertainment on the crosswords and it dodn't feel like Disnet at all.

69,Very over rated,"This was extremely disappointing, the lines 120 + minutes for a ride or any show. The street parades allowed for some to sit but this included collapsing of prams in the space allowing for less people in the very small areas, attendants just wanted to move you on and no English speaking so had no idea where we could stand to watch the street parade. Queuing for food or toilets was 30 mins. There needs to be a limit on tickets sold each day for you to enjoy the park. Many other attractions in Japan that I would recommend before this.
Very dismal compared to what the USA has to offer.","Written January 1, 2020",2.0 of 5 bubbles
70,Long..Long lines,"First time at Disney Tokyo. Unfortunately we didn't do our research when it came to waiting in line for rides and shows. Please do not come if your expecting short wait periods...most rides and attractions have a 90min to up to 170 min wait. Fast pass sounds like a great idea and we were set to explore this so we didn't have to wait in line for excess period of time with two children under 6.

This also was a disappointment as we found out that we coud only book a fast pass for one ride which we did at 8.30am to have a ride at 3.50pm with no lining up. We tried to secure another fast pass for Winnie the Poo but could not until 10.53am. That's fine so I went back to get a fast pass at the recommended time only to be told that I could not secure a ride without waiting till 21.35pm???

Please make sure your aware of this before coming and be prepared to spend most of your day waiting in line for these attractions.

If you want a good young family Disney experience without the excessive wait times please try LA or Orlando.

76,A Must-Place Visit,"We visited this on our second day in Japan and have marked it as a place we really wanted to visit.

In terms of size, Tokyo Disney is large enough that it will take at least a whole day to visit but not large enougj to the point where you are wondering where the edge of this theme park is. Every part of the theme park is within a distance that is not too far to reach.

It must be said that with a toddler with an upset stomach we didn‚Äôt really go on any rides. Though we went and enjoyed going on an It‚Äôs A Small World.

The parades are truly something to be enjoyed. Perhaps those familiar to this part of the Disney theme parks can say that they‚Äôve seen it all but it is something to watch various Disney Characters go past you.

Spread over the theme park are various restaurants and food booths. In terms of restaurant, I recommend Restaurant Hokusai and Eastside Cafe, both of which I‚Äôve reviewed. In terms of snack, I recommend the snack booth in front of the It‚Äôs A Small World ride which sells hot chocolate and chocolate glazed donut.

Somehow it is more crowded in the late afternoon towards the evening rather than in the morning towards noon.

In terms of transportation, Tokyo Disney has its own train line which takes you from
Tokyo Disney to Disney Sea and then to the hotels. Note however that this train line is separate from the JR train line. To get to the JR line, you have to change platforms at Maihama.","Written December 23, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

87,As a foreigner I didn't feel welcome (others please keep in mind),"Dear Tokyo Disney,

I was excited for the day to be able to be 6 years old again. However, I have to say it was not what I was expecting.

I'm disappointed in you Tokyo Disney.

It was 2001 when I went to Disneyland California for the first time. It was a child's dream. A great memory that will always last forever for me and my family. I will never forget it. But this...coming to Tokyo Disney, yeah, I can forget this for sure.

First off, what the hell? I'm Canadian who as been living here for a few months now. I've seen and heard some things...I know. And yet, I wasn't expecting I would get it here at Tokyo Disney. I thought everyone would be equal. I was wrong.

For example, ( and this happened multiple times) I stood for 15 minutes trying to get a picture for ONE character while so character kept pulling JAPANESE VISITORS right when they got there. I left after that because it was a waste of my time. Like seriously? Do I not exist as a person? I'm waiting PATIENTLY! The characters see me, I was. They wave back, and yet they keep motioning Japanese people (not just children) to come and take pictures of them. Even after I have tried to move in for a photo myself. Not fair and very rude (shout out to the Incredible's family for doing this! INCREDIBLE!! Great job!) am I or other foreigners not important as a visitor? Do I nor other foreigners matter? ( and yes, I saw this happen to other foreigners too).

You should be ashamed of yourselves for all who work here and ignore foreigners. I know most of you who work here are foreigners so you need to think about your actions! I had a horrible time! Waiting in line for everything was expected but ti see my favourite Disney character?! Yeah, you really need to think about your actions cast members> I feel bad for my friend who came all this way for this place!

Tokyo Disney, get a hold of yourself. I know you all won't sere this and I'm just one person out of 1,000,000,000 but this is the 21st century. There are not just Japanese that come here. People all over the world come here and should be treated EQUALLY AS EVERYONE ELSE!!! And I saw this multiple time when I was there too with foreigners being treated badly.

Think about it. Please.

PS.(only reason I'm not giving 0/5!) Thank you to the only character who made me feel welcome! Geppetto staff member, thank you for making my day, noticing me and making me feeling welcome as a normal visitor. You were the highlight of my stay. Also the girl who helped me get a rock star black and white scarf at the Pirates of the Caribbean souvenir shop. Thank you!! I still wear it a lot! <3

88,I love Disneyland but I not this one,"I can't tell you why it was such an ordinary experience. The week before I had had the best day at Shanghai Disneyland. This one just felt really boring and I left early, very disappointed. I don't know what they did wrong, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time and money, as it cost over $100 including transport. Also the imitation American food was way overpriced.","Written December 3, 2019",2.0 of 5 bubbles

90,The happiest place on earth!,We had stunning weather so it was already nice! The park is well kept ( but at the moment there is a lot of construction undergoing ). What was strange was that it was SUPER crowded - we managed to go on 3 things and that's it. Waiting times 120 min and more and the next fastpass available was at 9 pm ( and we checked at 1 pm...) so yeah that was not pleasant at all and we were a little bit sad.,"Written December 2, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
91,Had a blast!!!!,"I came here on August 2018. I went on Wednesday, so there weren't that many people. The wait for the popular rides (Pooh) were about 1 hour-ish. I guess that's average, since it's also summer break in Japan. I got my ticket from klook---and then went to the Disneyland station to get the ticket. I went on most of the rides, and it was fun!! Only thing is restaurants gets packed, so make sure to book advanced (if allowed--not sure about this), or bring your own lunch. I would recommend buying some lunch from the convenience store, 7/11!! I had the turkey leg inside the park, and it was good!! I watched the parade, it was nice to see the characters!! Sadly, no firework because it was windy that day :(!!

Our high expectations were not just met, they were exceeded. The reason we had such a marvellous time was because of the details and the people. From the un-birthday cake to alien inspired mochi Tokyo Disney is truly the best Disney land there is.

The park is very crowded even on a weekday but the crowd is generally very orderly. Many food and beverage options, but you might want to make reservations in advance at some of the restaurants if you do not wish to wait. For rides with Fast Pass options, it is best to use Fast Pass instead of taking the standby line as it move very slowly especially for the more popular rides. Lots of souvenirs to buy, and there are also popcorn kiosks where you can buy the different kinds of souvenir bucket and different flavours popcorn.","Written November 26, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

97,A magical fun time at the happiest place on earth,"Had the chance to visit a few Disneyland across the world and this Disneyland was one of my favorite to visit as I had an awesome and wonderful time in Tokyo Disneyland.

All of the cast members at Tokyo Disneyland were very cheerful and very helpful which made it üëå and it definitely adds. To the whole Disney magic.

Food was also very delicious & kawaii as worth trying.

The rides were magical and even though there were some rides that had a wait time of 60 mins (though it definitely felt shorter than that), I didn‚Äôt mind the wait time because it was worth it. Worth getting the fast past for Pooh‚Äôs Honey Hunt & Monsters, Inc Ride Hide and Seek as those two were my favorite rides at the park. Worth mentioning that these two parks are worth recommending as it is their top attraction at the park.

A bit disappointed that Space Mountains was closed for maintenance and that there were renovations that was going around the spark but that didn‚Äôt deter me from having fun at the park.

Would love to go back in the future once the renovations are done and to check out the new rides & attractions at Tokyo Disneyland","Written November 21, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

It is written in the website but still sad because we are unable to see it. There's quite a long queue for each ride despite us going on a Wednesday. Was hoping for more stitch merchandise but there isn't alot of it.
However, i feel that the restaurants there serve pretty delicious food. There are different popcorn buckets and different popcorn flavors too.","Written November 21, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
100,Better than Anaheim Disney,"I live in Southern Calif and have been to Anaheim Disney literally 200+ times. Tokyo is better than Anaheim! Almost every ride here was more extravagant than at Anaheim; way better (Pooh ride is amazing!, especially compared to Anaheim - way different). Lines were shorter, prices cheaper, and good variety of food and drinks. Loved Tokyo Disneyland!","Written November 21, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
101,Just OK,"Visited on a Tuesday. We entered the park just prior to 9am with only a short wait at the entrance. We purchased our tickets online and printed off copped to scan at the gate.

Most disappointing was the amount of renovation work being carried out on the castle and surrounds. We were aware of this prior thanks to the official website.

Being in our 40‚Äôs we only went on the tame rides! And we noticed that wait times for the most rides were less than 60 minutes in most cases.

Being massive Star Wars fans this was the attraction we visited first up and walked straight in with no wait time. We had hoped for some exclusive Star Wars merchandise to be on sale at Disneyland but were extremely disappointed. Aside from dozens of key rings, toy blasters and a money box, that was all. Maybe it‚Äôs a licensing thing?

Other attractions we visited were the Mark Twain Boat, the river jungle cruise, and the train. I also rode the log ride at splash mountain and as a single rider, I was on within 15 minutes. Strangely this ride was closed in the afternoon.

Having visited Disney Sea 2 years ago, we both felt that is the more appealing park. I can‚Äôt explain it but Disneyland to me just lacked the colour and vibe of Disneyland.

I probably would not visit here again, unless some exciting new attraction opened. Disney Sea I would revisit.","Written November 19, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles
102,A fabulous family day,"Our family (incl 8 & 10 yo) had a wonderful day at Tokyo Disney.
Yes, many of the rides stories are Japanese language but we found this did not detract from the experience. Disappointedly some rides were not available but I knew this thanks to checking online prior.
All the cast are friendly, helpful and cheerful adding to the magic of the day.
We loved Buzz Astro, Star Tours(even non Star Wars fans), Splash Mountain, Big Mountain. Miss 8 loved Snow White and Peter Pan ride. We all agreed that after a 1hr wait, Haunted Mansion was the lamest ride.
The shows were excellent and easy to catch during the day.
Yes, there were heaps, heaps of people but we never felt crowded. We got food easily and it was tasty. Pizza, ice cream and curries. Reasonably priced.
We felt 1 day was not enough.
My tips for a great day is plan! Work out what you‚Äôre family will most likely enjoy, get there 90mins before opening if you‚Äôre not staying at a Disney hotel, and get your fast passes.
We got our first fast pass for Buzz 9 mins after opening and it was for a slot 2 hrs later. We managed to ride Snow White, It‚Äôs a small world, the carousel, Peter Pan and Star Tours in this time.
If you can, use the app and check wait times online. This helped us hugely.
Don‚Äôt forget to check out the popcorn flavours and souvenir containers.
We had a fabulous day and would love to go back.","Written November 19, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
103,A fun Disney park. Unique in all the right ways.,"Really enjoyed my time at Tokyo Disneyland. I recommend getting there before opening, and prioritizing a Fastpass for the excellent Pooh ride.

Shocked and appalled, though, by the cultural arrogance of reviews here critiquing the rides dialogue for being in Japanese. The park is in Japan, what other language would the rides be in? It didn't matter to me that I often didn't understand ride dialogue, it's part of the experience and the fun!","Written November 18, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
104,Stunning atmosphere & food,"After visiting all Disneyworld parks I can say this park is in my top 3.

The park itself is not what I expected, since being in Tokyo a few days before. I expected more lights, technology, shows. The park itself is an older park, especially since it‚Äôs the first international Disneyland.

But what made our experience was the atmosphere. There was no pushing or shoving. There was a respect for everyone in the park. While created such a friendly atmosphere.
The staff are always smiling and waving and super helpful if your not sure of anything, they‚Äôll go out of their way to help.

Another HUGE highlight was the food. WOW!! No only are the designs super cute (almost too good to eat), but the taste is out of this world.
I would book a ticket and go back any day just for the pork rice roll. Definitely try it if you visit this park.","Written November 17, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
105,Disappointing!,"My family and I was at Disneyland in Nov 2019. There were a fair amount of rides but quite a few of the rides were either closed or being renovated! PLEASE CHECK before heading there!

There were tons of people even on a weekday. For a foreign tourist who does not speak Japanese, I will suggest giving this a Disneyland a miss. All the rides' storylines were in Japanese ... we could not understand the storylines though some may argue that it the experience of the 3D/4D rides etc.

Foodwise - I think the variety at a single spot is not ideal (3-4 choices) but the quality is reasonable and cost-wise ... not too bad.

On the whole ... my little one enjoyed herself but mental note to myself ... to consider other Disneylands if I want a better experience.","Written November 17, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles

107,The best thing is either broken down or in construction,"So I went to Disneyland Tokyo and I was a little disappointed as the Cinderella castle was covered up for construction or something. My friends and I were like ok hmmmmmm all good then we went to go on splash mountain which is one of the best/popular ride there, that was closed so we went for the next best thing which I couldn‚Äôt wait for and that was the space mountain coaster in Tomorrowland and guess what yep that was closed as well. It was disappointing but I still had an amazing time.","Written November 13, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles
108,"Not the best theme park in the world, but not far off...","We've been to every other Disney Resort except Shanghai and in terms of the number and quality of attractions, on the whole Tokyo Disneyland compares very favourably. 

Splash Mountain is great and very well-maintained. Big Thunder Mountain is worth doing but not the best ride of this sort (out of other BTMs and the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars).

Monsters Inc was fun and the flashlight effect added to it, though it means you get distracted and miss some of the animatronics, which are incredible - it is just as much fun without using the flashlight! The Park has one of the best Pirates of the Caribbean rides, and the Jungle Cruise was good and the drivers were really funny- even though we they spoke only Japanese on the ride and we don't speak any!

Pooh's Hunny Hunt is super impressive, it's hard to describe other than its a different ride than its counterparts elsewhere in the world and they've really invested in it to make it amazing. 

The Western Railroad is also really well done and far superior to the equivalent railroads in Hong Kong and Paris.

It has one of the best Space Mountain, its quite exciting and well worth doing a few times. Star Tours is much what you expect.The Buzz Lightyear ride is well worth doing.

We really enjoyed the Cinderella rooms in the Castle, and its good to see the Castle being put to a productive use. The shop in the castle with the artisans is cool too.
One thing that was really cool was how they added a Nightmare Before Christmas theme to the Haunted Mansion - this was really effective and added a great new dimension to a classic ride.

The theming of the Park is generally very strong, though not as stunning and impressive as DisneySea (though that is really something else - see our review on that). There are more wide open spaces than we were expecting which is nice.

Where this Park suffers is that, unlike some other Disney parks, is not easy to do a lot of good attractions on one day, even if you get there early and are clever with your Fastpasses. That's because here you have to wait two hours to get another Fastpass, and Fastpasses run out early for some attractions. ,We also got there 45 minutes before Park opening one day and it took a long time to process the crowd (on a Wednesday in September) so all we got was a short wait at Splash Mountain, after which the Park seemed quite full. Though it must be said that in these respects the Park is not nearly as busy as DisneySea, which suffers from a lack of big attractions and also considerable wait times on the big attractions they do have.

The cast are very warm and friendly and we got a few extra Fastpasses (Haunted Mansion, Roger Rabbit, Mickey Mouse) when cast members found out it was our honeymoon. All the cast seemed genuinely happy for us, which was touching.  Some wanted to take photos with us or for us, and gave us stickers which they personalised by writing our names and messages in Japanese and English. Individual staff members went above and beyond to give us a magical time, which really made us feel special, and in such a busy place, in such a busy city, that is really something.

We went in September, when the public are encouraged to show up in costume. This was an interesting experience to see all the people in amazing costumes, but often they got in the way as they were posing for photos all over the place. A lot of the costumes were world class and almost indistinguishable from the 'real' princesses. The outfits were a spectacle all of their own.

There are food options which are not bad value, and we really enjoyed the experience of the Queen of Hearts banquet hall with the souvenir mug and plate. The Q of H has the most amazing decor - it's worth going to just for that and you didn't need a reservation, we just went straight in.

All in all a great Disney experience. 

By the way, its only 15 minute easy flat walk from Disneyland to DisneySea, even though the cast members tell you it will take half an hour.","Written November 13, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

If you are disabled you can get your ticket amended and get special fast passes at some rides. You need to tell a cast member that you are disabled and you need to register with proof at the town hall.

120,Always a happy place,"The queue will always be there, except for that one day in the middle of winter when the heavy rainstorm hit Tokyo.

Food options are different to DisneySea and other Disneylands& WDW on the other side of the globe.

Smell of fresh popcorns in different flavours (soy sauce and butter/ caramel/ honey/ teriyaki/ etc.) follows you as you walk around the park. Then your eyes are drawn to the ice cream wagon where they sell Mickey head-shaped ice block in tropical fruits flavour, and Minnie in a berry flavour. Our last visit was in October 2019 and they sold churros, Jack Skellington burger (Halloween special), purple potato hot bun in cinnamon, etc. But last Summer, they sold shave ice (Hawaiian style) and the mikan (mandarin) flavour was the best! The Alice in Wonderland Banquet Hall is always almost full, check timing first before you go.
There are only a few restaurants inside the park however plenty of food court-style and street carts.

Best non-classic rides for chickens like me (non-classic rides like Snow White, Peter Pan, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. Non-roller coaster, G-force style rides):
- Monsters Inc (shootiqng ride using flashlight)
- Winnie the Pooh (bumper cars style, but you don't control it)
- Buzz Lightyear (shooting ride, similar to Disneyland HongKong but slightly longer ride)

If ever you are feeling unwell for whatever reasons, Disneyland's Central Health (white/green cross on the map) near ""Main Street""/ entrance gate, is superb and smells like Dettol. They have multiple nurses and doctors on site and are very professional and helpful.","Written November 4, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Most queue times for rides where between estimated at 50-90 mins.

Theres large queues for everything including toilets and popcorn, even restaurants queues out the door and up the street.

We managed to use the fast pass feature once and still had to wait at least 20 mins. By 12:00 all the fast pass time slots where used up or too late At night so you had to join the normal queues anyway.

40 minutes to 1 hours to get a popcorn
No Disney characters anywhere
2 hours to get into a restaurant
The food is horrible very very bad and no vegetarian menu.
People were taking the seats randomly and you need to compete to get a seat.
People start to line for a show 5 hours before it so all the good spots are gone
It‚Äôs all about merchandise whit low quality, I mean nothing you buy you felt that awesome Japan quality
No space to take a break

My your 4 and 8 start crying because they couldn‚Äôt even get into any ride. We‚Äôve got only into the tree which you walk in and that‚Äôs it.

We were exhausted after 2 hours and went back after our horrible lunch. I wonder how they make those meals it is worse that‚Äôs the worse airlines foods.

I bet Disney would cry to saw the mess Japanese people have done to Disney. Disney have to prohibit this park for proceeding.

This time, Splash mountain and Big Thunder mountain had queue times of 3 hours!
This is crazy. The queue snaked all the way down to the streets, past restaurants.
As we were with some friends who were visiting Tokyo Disneyland for the first time, we bite our teeth and joined the queue.

It didn‚Äôt take us 3hours to reach the front, it took us 2.5hours, this should be some consolation. Even the queues into the characters‚Äô hones has 1.5 hours queue times. So we were the from the park opening and closing, we completed a grand total of 3 rides, watched 2 parades and had lunch.

Parades were still good and their decorations according to the Seasons/holidays were beautiful, better than HK‚Äôs Disneyland. I do think Disney has lost the magic somewhat. Staff seem less friendly and smiley than before.

For 30 minutes we‚Äôve not been allowed to go anywhere and the restaurant we were walking into closed down until the parade is over. The parade has now arrived-it‚Äôs bizarre and doesn‚Äôt sound or look like Disney. It ended with a nice sign thanking their sponsor. Japan has been awesome-so upset I wasted my time and a lot of money to come and stay here.
Did I mention, when we tried to go into the Miracosta Hotel to check into our $650 room three employees blocked the entrance and required ID to confirm you were a guest. And, anything you were carrying was checked. A level of BS that was just about intolerable.","Written October 6, 2019",1.0 of 5 bubbles

143,Amazing fun with family,"Had a great day with my wife and 2 young kids. Lots to see and my son was so excited to have a photo with Mickey. The queue was long, which was understandable, but then the actual duration of the ride felt too short, leaving the feeling of under-whelmed. I understand that longer ride duration means the ones queuing would have to wait longer. Perhaps they could build the attraction to take more people at every batch?

Staff were friendly and helpful. Some of them even speak reasonable-level of English.

I got minor injury and had to visit first aid centre. Apparently no staff in first aid centre could speak English (maybe tourists other than me never got injured, lol), but they were quick to pull out their phone and open Google Translate. We managed to somehow communicate enough for me to get proper treatment. Good and memorable experience after all.

My kid enjoyed the popcorn that comes with toy. Lunch time was also interesting with all those Mickey-shaped and heart-shaped food selection.

Before your visit, make sure you do enough reading about the popular attractions/rides and prepare at least basic plan. Also, read about Fastpass, how it works, and the fact that it's only given to limited number of passengers per ride per day.

Overall, still easily one of the best theme parks on the planet. Being in Japan, I enjoy seeing their unique culture touch to the famous ""happiest place on Earth"".","Written October 4, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Went on a Thursday, arriving approximately an hour prior to the gates opening and the crowds waiting to enter was chaotic! Highly recommend researching the layout of the park prior to going and begin by obtains express passes for the rides you want to go on as they go very quickly. The Star Wars ride was awesome as was Space Mountain. All staff we had dealings with were fantastic, really friendly and helpful. Most Japanese patrons dressed up in some amazing outfits and costumes or got changed into Disney t-shirts and ears once there. Staff in the gift shops will remove tags etc enabling you to wear them.

Our advice would be to not go during peak times as the day we went was crazy busy enough and not peak time (that we were aware of anyway). Now we have been, not sure we would go again either in Japan or other location.","Written October 1, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles

We walked right past the whole line of waiting people- on and on and on and on!! -to the very front! We were on the ride within 5 min. Saves you so much time. But we went back at 6:30pm to ride again and they were only allowing people holding fastpasses to ride. So go early enough in the day. Also, don't miss the Mickey Philharmagic- it's a bit more than just a show, with scents and wind, etc.... I'm glad we went. And the Mark Twain Riverboat is very nice at night, when you can see all the lights.","Written September 28, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

There are some pretty long queues for the rides, and on occasions they actually close the rides for the ‚Äústandby‚Äù people, and allow only ‚Äúfast pass‚Äù people to ride. This was pretty disappointing as the Splash Mountain ride was one we wanted to do just before going home, but it was closed to the ‚Äústandby‚Äù, from 7:00 pm to 8:30 pm!! Not good enough!

The merchandise is everywhere and the patrons certainly get into the theme of Disneyland by dressing up to theme. A very pleasant day, thanks!","Written September 26, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
151,Disney but not...,"I might be biased since we grew up going to Disney World, but I didn‚Äôt get the same Disney feel here. Tokyo Disney has an app for Japanese residents to be able to access the wait times and for fast passes. This is a big disadvantage for foreign visitors and actually made our visit disorganized and we were not able utilize our time wisely. Plus side, the parks are not the size as their Florida counterparts, so you are able to walk back and forth across the park quickly.
The park opens at 9am with lines forming outside the gate an hour early. They started to allow visitors through security 15 mins before 9, and the line did move quickly. People lined up in front of the rides and were allowed to officially enter the ride lines at 9am. This was a little confusing since a lot of people crowded around an area that squeezed into 1 line. I‚Äôm sorry if we cut in front of anyone, but we were just trying to go with the flow. Wait times were usually around 40-80 mins for the big rides and 15 for the smaller rides. Splash Mountain was 90+ wait mid day, but the single rider option pushed us through within 15 mins. We were able to ride all the rides and head back to the monorail by 8pm. We decided to eat dinner at the mall by the train station to bypass the crazy lines at the park for restaurants. You have to try the different flavors of popcorn and buying the collectible popcorn holder does save some $$. It‚Äôs $25 for the holder and first flavor of popcorn. Refills are $5 and hold 2 servings compared to paying for $4 for a single serving. Get a Fast pass to the Pooh ride first thing in the morning.

Although we didn't manage to get on most of the rides (try to get there before the park open so that you can get the fast pass) , just being there was enough. The parade especially the night parade was really good. There were lots of places to eat but as a muslim there wasn't that many choices. Best to bring pre-packed food/meals. There was also lots of Disney merchandise shops all over the park so getting a souvenier wasn't that difficult. The only downside was that you weren't allowed to use a selfie stick so we either had someone to take of us or use the timer on the camera.

159,They took the best parts of Disneyland and Disney World and put them into 1 park!,"This is a Castle park, so there are certain things you can expect. The usual attractions, the familiar layout, the shows, and parades. What I didn't expect is the best versions of Splash Mountain, Pirates, Jungle Cruise, and Space Mountain. The upkeep of all the rides was impressive. Not a single animatronic on any ride was out of service. The fog was where it was supposed to be. The lights had working bulbs. The sounds were on point. This has always been a little thing that takes a bit of the magic out in the states. It's depressing when you ride Splash Mountain at Disneyland and three of the animatronics sit there and don't move. Or they cant do the fire at Indiana Jones anymore, etc. The world Bazaar is cool and a cool update to Main Street USA. The castle is huge and beautiful and allows you to walk through it with some cool special effects. Overall, this will make you feel like being in the states, minus its EVEn cleaner (which the US does good with), its ran more efficiently, and the crowds are easier to deal with, even though there can be more crowds. No scooters taking up all the streets, strollers are minimal (yes we pushed ours like all of you), and the lines are orderly.

This is In Japan. Mickey speaks Japanese only. Even though Walt Disney is an American company, still this is in Japan. None of attraction has translation. In a way, the attraction of ‚Äúit‚Äôs a small world‚Äù uses most multiple languages (in singing) during the ride.
However, the Disney magic is universal. Even though all the explanation is in Japanese, easily, we could get some gist of it. Maybe less 30% fun/ exciting than Japanese speakers though.
It‚Äôd be nice to have them wear some language badge or tag so that people who may need help in a different language could rely on those symbols.
Strongly wishing that they should equip multiple language tool or announcement for each attraction. Especially, Disney sea is Japan original theme park that we cannot enjoy this anywhere else but there.

166,Disneyland and Disney Sea review,"We visited both parks so I‚Äôll lump my review together.

We went on a Thursday which was projected to be a very low volume day. Joke was on us because the park was as busy as Magic Kingdom is at Christmas! We arrived an hour before gates opened and were surprised to see endless lines already forming. They do not have any separate lines for guests who do not have bags so be prepared to wait regardless. When the park opened everyone ran toward Soarin (we started at Disney Sea) as that‚Äôs the newest ride at the park. We were at the FastPass ticketing booth by 9:15am and the FastPass booth was distributing return tickets for 9:10 pm! It was sold out within minutes for the day. This was not how we wanted to start our day. Luckily we were able to obtain another FastPass 2 hours after this. You can get a new FastPass every two hours in the parks but they sell out very quickly.

We purchased a one day ticket to Disney Sea and a 5 pm ticket for Disneyland so we could experience both parks in one day. A park hopper ticket does not exist at Tokyo Disney so this was our work around. The costs for these two tickets is still cheaper than one day at Magic Kingdom alone. Disneyland park is just about what you can expect for the traditional Disney rides. It‚Äôs A Small World is the best version of the ride I have ever seen and I‚Äôve been to 4 international parks.

Disney Sea‚Äòs details and themed lands are impeccable. They really left no detail out and it shows. This is nothing like what were used to in the America parks. I was seriously impressed.

Food is reasonably priced which was a surprise since most reviewers say the food costs are astronomical. Quite frankly the park‚Äôs food costs are cheaper than the American parks. We paid $4.50 for a hot dog, $3 for a popsicle, $2 for a bottle of Coke. The only outrageous costs were the refillable popcorn buckets at $25 a piece with a $5 refill.

Souvenirs are quite different as well. Hardly any clothing options to purchase in any of the park stores. There‚Äôs one designated park clothier in each of the parks with extremely limited selection. Most souvenirs are trinkets like headbands, landyard/ticket holders, keychains, etc. There is an extensive selection of Japanese sweets to purchase as well.

All in all, glad we made the visit. This is a once in a lifetime trip. I won‚Äôt be going back simply based on the crowds. The crowds are insane so be prepared to wait in very long lines for everything. There aren‚Äôt many character meet and greets and for those that exist the lines were crazy. The food stand lines were also hectic...so just be prepared to wait for literally everything in both parks.

The Mickey popsicles are by far the best frozen treat you can find. There is a Mickey hand sandwich in Toontown which is adorable. The Mickey shaped churro really exists but only found it at one cart in the back of the park at Sea. Beware - most of the churro carts around the park are not the cinnamon sugar type. We had a pizza churro. There were stands selling sweet potato churros too.

The Monorail system is also more like a Japanese subway line. You need to pay $2.50 to ride the loop one time between the parks. This is worth it considering the walk between the two parks is extensive.

US credit cards are accepted everywhere in the park including snack carts and drink stands.","Written September 5, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
167,Must See For Disney Fans,"This was our second experience at Tokyo Disneyland. It is a different experience than Disneyland (Anaheim) or Magic Kingdom (Orlando). We stayed for the Electrical Parade and it was great - were lucky to find good spot to watch toward back of park near Tomorrow Land. Another good thing is price - the one-day Passport is less than $80 for adults. But we did not arrive til about 4:30 and discovered a special summer program called ‚ÄúNatsu 5‚Äù where entry after 5:00 was only $44/adult. But note that August is not a good time of year for two reasons: (1) weather - very hot and humid and (2) all schools in Japan are out in August - many more people. Whenever we visit Tokyo, Tokyo Disneyland will always be on our schedule. This time we stayed at the Hilton Disney Resort so getting to Tokyo Disneyland was very easy. (The last time we were in Yokohama and the hotel had a special bus that went straight to (and from) the Park.)

We took a local train from my hotel (nearby Nakano station) to the park and arrived around 7:30AM. I could not believe that it is a long line-up that early. Fortunately, I booked the entrance tickets for me and my family (2 adults and 1 child, ticket price around Yen 18,000), thus, I didn't have to line up to buy it. There are many hot attractions you can participate. However, because of crowded people, you should line up first to take some fast passes which allows you save time of waiting for games.
I tried to have some fried turkey legs for lunch, it costs around Y1000/pack. Its taste is nice.

We found the morning the busiest, with long queues. We grabbed our first Fast Pass for later in the day and then queued for a second ride. The queues did die down as the day went on and by the end of the day we had managed all the rides we wanted to go on, and some of the smaller rides too. We made use of single rider queues too. Plus we managed to watch the parades in between.

My teenager's favourite ride was: Space Mountain. The street parade was really fabulous! If you ever go to Tokyo please do go visit Tokyo Disneyland.

The public transportation in Tokyo is phenomenal and can get you anywhere really quick, and it just so happens to get you right in front of Disneyland. The prices blew my mind since they are so expensive here, but we paid only about $60 per person for a 1-day 1-park pass. All of the signs and maps are in English (and Japanese) which made it convenient - but I still had my Google translator ready. Similar rides in Tokyo as we do at Disneyland, but most are in Japanese, which made it even more fun personally. The walkways are huge and spread out very nicely and it was never too crowded anywhere we went. The food selection was perfect for those who like adventure, otherwise they did have hotdogs closer to the entrance. All of the people in the park (cast members and guests) were incredibly nice and helpful. The park was spotless and there was a spot in ‚ÄúWesternland‚Äù (our Adventureland) that you could buy some real cowboy attire. We went during the summer so it was humid since it is right near the ocean and it had been raining that morning. Make sure you wear something breathable and make sure you have a rain coat handy because it does tend to rain frequently in Tokyo. The lines weren‚Äôt awful for some of the rides, but others had hour+ long lines but that wasn‚Äôt anything new since Disneyland in California is the same.

I was able to buy tickets the day before from the local 7 Eleven, even though they weren't available online.

As it is summer now, there was this special event, ‚ÄúDonald‚Äôs Hot Jungle Summer‚Äô, exciting and thrilling.

I‚Äôd heard stories that the Disneyland in Tokyo was very crowded and we wouldn‚Äôt get many rides however that turned out not to be the case. We turned up about 9am which is quite late for the Japanese who tend to get there on opening but even then we ticked off Pirates of the Caribbean and Jungle Cruise in the first half hour. Both had wait times of 5-10 minutes. It started getting more crowded as the day wore on but not as crazy as Disneyland in Anaheim which we visited last year. As per my title it gets real hot real quick and we were really sweating by mid morning. We are staying at Disneyland hotel next door which made it real convenient to nip back to the hotel mid afternoon for a break before re-entering park in early evening. I‚Äôd recommend this as trying to tackle it all in a day would be possible but would be draining.

192,Mickey suck money,"Japan Disneyland Disneyland Disneyland

Well , where shall I start ? Let see .

Before anyone ever visit this so called magical place , is like almost every single person child hood that need to fulfill in some point of our life .

This so called theme park isn‚Äôt really a theme park but rather more of a pay money to enjoy been tortured . ( if you like been tortured by using money , this will be your best solution )
The entrance fee isn‚Äôt the only fee that you be paying . There is other plus plus involved inside it . ( leeching more money off you )

Almost each so called theme that you going in , you need to wait at least 45min ( none peak season ) and it nothing you can play , rather more like a sight seeing or watching old Disney cartoon .
Don‚Äôt see much Disney character walking around the theme park ( maybe cause that moment I am there , is raining )
No firework during summer
No special season ticket after 3pm ! ( I think this special ticket only for winter season )
Even the most iconic character of all time is hiding inside his house aka Mickey house , just to leech you more money ( to take photo with Mickey , you need to pay him royalty fee ) or you can only have 1 photo using your camera . ( how bad is that ? , I came all the way from another country because of you Mickey , and you wan more money just to have photo with you !!! That a pathetic move from Disney ! ( thanks Disney but no thanks )
Some theme isn‚Äôt even available and we still get charge full price for our entrance . ( I am not a stingy person but this type of greedy business system is what put people off ) .

Anyhow , my conclusion for this , do it once and don‚Äôt do it anymore , not worth the time waiting for each theme just for sightseeing . ( there are plenty more of other way to make you feel better )

BUT on the other hand , you still need to fulfill your childhood üòÇ

193,It really is the happiest place on earth!,"We visited with a group of 8 people aged from 8 to 70 and we all had a fabulous time. We were there on a Tuesday in April and there were only a few things that had excessive long wait times - mainly the roller coasters and more popular rides. With no interest in roller coasters, we were able to go on most of our choices without waiting more than around 10 minutes. The special event Easter parade was excellent. We had lunch at Tomorrowland Terrace, which offers a good range of fast food options including fries, Mickey shaped chicken nuggets and Mickey shaped burgers. We also had a delicious peach cake which came with a limited edition Disney Easter souvenir plate. We had dinner at the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall which is a counter-service buffeteria-style restaurant. We lined up for around 30 minutes but the food was excellent and worth the wait. The unbirthday cake was particularly delicious and easily served 4 to 6 people. Unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled the night we were there due to unsatisfactory weather conditions, which was disappointing.","Written July 29, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

It was lesser populous than Disney Sea but I think it a much better park. Vast, so good walking shoes are necessary but much to see in between walking and/or queueing for rides. Any Disneyland is a must and this one is no exception. There was no language barrier with those staff who don't speak English carrying a phrase book to help with communication.","Written July 24, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
198,Almost perfect,"The three of us went during the first week of July and had a wonderful time. We went on weekdays but it was still crowded. It was also rainy but that didn't keep people away. There were still lines for the more popular rides but the fast pass system helps to eleviate this so that you're not queuing all day. There are more things to do in the park than just the rides, anyway. It's a very clean park and the cast members are lovely and helpful. Most speak some English although it was difficult sometimes when you are asking about something specific. But they have created a Disneyland that has many of the same atmospheres of the original in California. It is not as big but it is expanding.

The parades are great. Be sure to secure a spot 45 minutes beforehand. People sit on mats and are very orderly for the most part. Cast members constantly come around to make sure everything is orderly and no one is breaking the rules. No hats, strollers must be folded, and you cannot stand in front of people. No kids on shoulders, either.

The food and merchandise are varied and not too pricey, especially compared to other parks. The green man mochi and flavoured popcorn are must tries.

The main criticism I have is character greetings. If you have a little girl who dreams of meeting Disney princesses, and that is the main reason you are coming, then there is a good chance that you will leave heartbroken and your little girl will be in tears. You have to be very very lucky. First of all, not all the princesses are here. Snow White, Cinderella, Belle and Rapunzel are the only ones you can meet (Ariel and Jasmine are at Disneysea). During a normal day, they are only available for meet and greets for a total of 15 minutes. After asking around we were finally able to find out where they would be. Once seen, a mob of 20-somethings will circle them, hoping to get chosen (there are no lines for this) by the princess, no doubt for their instagram pages. Luckily the princesses know this, and mostly choose children (dress your girls up in princess outfits to heighten your chances). My young girl (she's 5) was chosen by Rapunzel and Belle for photos (both princesses were very kind to my daughter). By the time we ran over to Snow White, it was all over. She gave my daughter a hug while I took a few fast photos, but that was it. 15 minutes and they are rushing back to get ready for the next parade. My daughter was very very lucky - most are not and I saw numerous people in tears. I don't know why Disneyland lets this happen. At Disneysea, Ariel is in her grotto all day, available for photos. Likewise, in Anaheim, princesses are available in the Fantasy Faire Royal Hall all day, and many of them are wandering around, available for meet and greets. This is the only big flaw in this park. Otherwise, it's a great place!","Written July 22, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
199,Fun park and outstanding service,It is mostly like the other Disney parks. Make sure to ride the Pooh ride (different than Anaheim). Try the different flavors of popcorn also.

200,Not as much of a fairytale as hoped,"I hadn‚Äôt been to Disneyland before so was really looking forward to experiencing my first trip to one.

We went on a weekday as advised as it‚Äôs meant to be quiet and it was horrendously busy felt like there were far too many people in the park, even to get a drink from a vending machine you were looking at 12 people in a queue throughout the day. The fast track pass was a joke as most of them had sold out extremely early. We managed to get one which was the buzz light year ride. We queued for 90 mins for the Winnie the Pooh ride which was over in 90 seconds and felt like a waste of time. The whole day there we managed 4 rides.

Then the parades the daylight one we were told to sit down and i couldn‚Äôt see a thing and then for the night time display found a good spot to stand and was told to move on by a staff member only to be told by another staff member to go back and pretty much advised to stand where view was blocked by bushes - poor organising.

The fireworks were amazing at the end and the graphics on the castle, some of the souvenirs were nice and the food although overpriced was tasty.

Did feel we wasted a day of our two week trip to Japan where we could have done something more fulfilling instead of constant queuing all the time, it has put me off going to any other Disneylands.","Written July 20, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles
201,Astronomically expensive & super long queue,"The whole world says to come on a weekday as it will be less crowded. Says who? it was super crowded. Lots & lots of people had already queued long before the gates opened. I saw many had brought their own picnic mats. But hey! It is winter & that thin flimsy piece of cloth is not going to keep your butt warm. Bring a portable stool please. Speaking of long queue, the waiting time to see Mickey Mouse was a staggering 90 minutes! Heck, I did not do it. Spend 90 minutes just to have a few photos taken with MM which will probably take less than 30 seconds?

Souvenirs were super expensive. A packet of soft candies cost 1,200 yen. Gulp! A rice ladle cost $16 SGD & a MM hair band costs SGD $20! (I cannot remember the exact yen). I was constantly converting yen to SGD on my hand phone, gasping at just how expensive everything was. If TDL kept increasing the price of admission tickets to boost its coffers, I would not be surprised if they did the same to its souvenirs.

Food wise, there was a rather limited selection no matter which restaurant you went to. And yes, all were expensive & taste lacklustre. I bought light refreshment from Daiei Supermarket to consume while queuing for the ride as apparently, eating while waiting as allowed, & I overheard a Japanese mother comment to her husband ""When are they going to stop eating?"" All right. So did she think I do not understand Japanese? I could have retaliate back but I decided to pretend I did not understand anything as I did not want to get angry & spoil my holiday mood.","Written July 20, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

I prefer Disney Sea more as the park is bigger and has more thrill rides and performance.

The few shows and rides worth seeing/ riding in Disneyland Tokyo are: Star Tours, Space Mountain, Stitch Encounter, Buzz Lightyear, and Mickey‚Äôs PhilharMagic.

Overall, more a park for kids or families rather than adults. More on DisneySea on another review.","Written July 14, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
206,Go early!,"We left getting our tickets quite late and we were visiting when it was the extended bank holiday so I'd say but them in plenty of time and buy them online. We saw people queuing to buy tickets and you risk not even getting in the park.
I'm not sure how busy this Disneyland is usually but I would recommend getting here for when it opens and getting a fast pass for space mountain. We did this and found we were able to get on another ride before our fast pass time. The fast passes sell out really quickly so it's worth it to get here early.
Food wise, the Mickey waffle from The Great American Waffle Company in World Bazaar and Mickey glove sandwich (we got ours at Plazma Ray's diner in Tomorrowland) are absolute musts.

209,Wonderful Day!,"On a two week trip to Japan, my husband and I decided to hit Tokyo Disney for two days...being the Disney fans we are. We booked a two day Passport ticket and visited Tokyo Disneyland first. The park was very similar to WDW, just smaller and about half the attractions. They are also missing the immaculate and lush landscaping of WDW but I think that is due to the difference in climate. The park is clean and the staff are both warm and amazing, even with the language barrier. We left not feeling the magic of Disney we are used to but were excited to go to the Disneysea Park on our second day.
It did not disappoint!!!! Disneysea is 200% magical, opulent with extremely detailed and wonderful lands to discover!! Similar in size and feel of Epcot. We could have spent two full days there, maybe three!
One thing about Japan Disney is their love and affection for Duffy the Bear. He is the bear Mickey gave Minnie, and if you‚Äôre a fan of Duffy, this is your spot as he has his own stores with tons of adorable merchandise!
Our favorite attractions were by far: Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of Earth and Tower of Terror but all of the rides were delightful and exciting. Try all of the popcorn flavors and make sure to get the shrimp donut/pasty food item which is near the American coastline area. Delish!!

you are issued electronic PDF tickets and like 99% of theme parks i‚Äôve been all over the world, you can use the bar or QR code on the PDF in your phone. but for some reason, the staff insists on using a printout which is archaic to the point of insanity.

i showed the turnstile girl that the turnstile will accept the QR code displayed from my phone but she insisted i use paper tickets which meant on the first day i had to walk all the way to an office tucked in a small corner with one very slow computer to print out the tickets. i don‚Äôt get why the QR code has to be shown on a printed ticket as opposed to the phone and don‚Äôt give me an excuse one or the other is easier to falsify because they both can be falsified if one wants to try. totally unreasonable. if you lived in a hotel apartment like i did with no access to a printer, you will be slightly screwed.

I was one of their first visitors and have visited it many, many times during those 35 years. July 5th I visited again with my family for a long deserved day out. Most of the day was very enjoyable, until we went to Big Thunder Mountain at 9:45 pm. Four members of my family had Fast Passes, I did not, but I obtained a ‚ÄúSingle Rider‚Äù pass so that we could all get in together. However, just as we were about to board a very unsympathetic and rude Attendant, a girl, refused to let me board with my family and separated us. I was forced to stand and wait with another ‚ÄúSingle Rider,‚Äù who was Japanese. I felt I was being punished for a misdemeanour and was not treated according to the usual Japanese ‚ÄúThe Customer is Number 1‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Customer is God‚Äù philosophy. I was bitterly hurt and disappointed, then faced being forced to wait until my family disappeared on the Ride and I was still waiting to board. I asked another Attendant. Another train came and went before I approached the second Attendant. She asked me to go to the back of the next train and join another customer. I decided that the fun had been taken away from me and indeed the entire day was ruined for me and my family because of this horrible experience. I asked to be shown the exit because I no longer wanted to go on the Ride. Both inside and outside I complained to other Staff and one of them walked behind my daughter and I and constantly apologised. I told him it was really too late and I was very hurt. The first Attendant was the most cold hearted person I have ever met in Tokyo Disneyland, and if she treats other customers like she treated me, a 70 year old, then she really should not be working there. I hope that other customers do not experience the cold hearted rudeness I was subjected to. I intend contacting Customer Services, which seems inaccessible, to further complain.

The park is incredibly clean, the staff are wonderful and the rides and attractions are just like the original park in LA. There is magic here BUT it is so incredibly packed that the magic turns to grumpiness because you have to line up for everything. It's ok if you wait for 30 mins.....but over 90 mins for a 2 minute ride is stretching the enjoyment level. Fast Passes and increased crowd volume are ruining the parks. There are just not enough attractions or rides for the volume of people. When you live in the same state/country as a Disney park you have the opportunity to buy an annual pass, so if you go on a busy day and only see 1 or 2 things, it's ok...you can come back. When you pay heaps of money to.fly your family to a Disney, pay for passes and accommodation, it is a major disappointment to stand in line for hours.

We spent two full days at the park and my favorite thing by far was the Dreamlights parade. We staked out a spot way before it started on a bench, but it didn't matter much since everyone sits in Japan (which is so much better). The parade is absolutely amazing! We weren't able to watch fireworks while we were there because they were cancelled every night (I think because of wind). We had a really fun time and can't wait for the new lands to open up!","Written June 22, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Ride lines as you expect in summer but not overwhelming long. Not as many cast members who speak English as I expected but enough who do , picture menus and signs to allow low frustration level. Plenty of shopping in park. Popcorn containers are a novelty item in a variety of themes. Wish I had room to bring some home","Written June 21, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

227,One of the best,"One of the best Disney Parks in the world. Wait times are no joke (Pooh's Hunny Hunt fastpasses are gone 90 minutes after park opening). Get there at least 30 minutes before park opening (preferably 45-60 minutes).

For Happy 15 entry, they let you in 30 minutes before, so make sure you are there 30 minutes before that.","Written June 20, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
228,Great experience,"I was visiting with a group of 30 high school students from the US, some who had and had never been to the park at home. I really enjoyed the experience overall as did the students. The entrance price was about $30 less than it is in the US and the park still uses ‚Äúfast passes‚Äù to allow visitors to cut the lines a few times during their visit. Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain were the two rides with the longest lines. Splash Mountain was closed for renovations.

All other rides had 45 minute predicted wait times or less. The least we saw was 20 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean.

Meal prices also weren‚Äôt bad. I had a large chicken curry and a large oolong tea for about $12 US and I purchased two bottled beverages for 200 yen each.

At first I had trouble finding souvenirs that were actually connected to Japan but later found small stuffed animals of Mickey, Minnie and friends in Kimonos for about $22 US. There were also bento lunch boxes, chopsticks, towels, assorted Japanese snacks in tins and other things related to Japan.

The light show was really nice though the fireworks were cancelled due to high winds. The park did make several announcements in Japanese and English alerting the crowd to the cancellation.

Overall a great experience!","Written June 19, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
229,Big disappointment (sorry Disney ),"We arrived in Yokohama and got a train to Disney to buy tickets for the following day. The lovely guy in the ticket office was great his name was Shimozawa.
He was helpful and friendly.
The following day we arrived excited to be here from England, but soon found out that it was so different to Other Disney‚Äôs we have been too.
The parade was over in a flash only around 6 floats and not worth the hours spent waiting for it.
All the Japanese people were singing with the catchy song they were singing which was lovely although we could understand a word of it.
To visitors from other countries a lot of Disney is spoken in Japanese which we were expecting bit not quite the same when given headsets to listen too.
We only saw one character all day and when we went near were waved away.
I‚Äôm disabled too.. I walk with a calliper and stick and like to stay out of my wheelchair when I can, but only one person, a young man who when we went to ride on the train showed me the lift and aloud me priority which was fantastic. The only person all day to do this. ( big thank you )
Haunted mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean I had to stand and wait although it was plain to see this was difficult for me and due to that we had to sit out the rest of the afternoon as this was just to much for me.
Love you Disney but here in Japan you didn‚Äôt care or look after me, and I can only tell as I found it.

California is prettier but the people here are so happy and lovely . We made a beeline for the Winnie the Pooh ride and my hubby loved it and wanted to go straight back on . We then went and got a fast pass for the monsters inc ride which was also good. We were lucky the lines were not long today and got in quite a few rides. The shopping was fantastic .

Going back was pretty convenient though although you need to be sure where you would like to alight. Go there a little earlier as the queue can be quite long, especially when it is closing time.

We've been to Hong Kong, Shanghai Disneyland previously. It looked pretty much the same although the Shanghai Disneyland seem bigger.

We made sure we got to the park about half an hour before opening and rushed to get our first fast pass. We then enjoyed as many rides as we could. Within a couple of hours we had gone on about 5 and then got our next fast pass.
It was got extremely crowded by lunch time, we went on a Monday. We noticed the next day it was not as busy as we were staying at a resort nearby. A Tuesday might be quieter. The longest queuing time was and 80 mins but the Japanese have it down to an art. The keep the lines moving so you always feel like you are getting somewhere.

The only criticism I have is the frustrating experience with the roaming characters. They should implement queue system instead of having everyone competing to be picked by the characters for photos and interaction. The characters tend to pick small children or those who dress uniquely.","Written June 8, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Loved the experience since Disney is all about enjoying it all like a little child! Express Pass was not necessarily helpful since all express passes have a certain time per ride that we could use. Unlike other parks where there is a separate lane for express pass holders where those can be used any time. A lovely ride! There is another park connected through mono rail called Disney Sea (about 5-7 min away) which is also a very good experience and therefore unless one knows Disney well enough covering both these in a day can be very taxing!

249,Very similar to all other Disney lands,"We came to Tokyo for the Disney Sea as this has more variation to other Disney parks. But whilst here we got a day here too. You choose your day when you buy tickets and can not hop between parks. As such you don‚Äôt get people leaving early as they have multiple day passes or because they‚Äôre heading to the other park to see a show or fireworks.
Crowd calendar said Wednesday would be quite but it wasn‚Äôt. We had the same poor selection of food as at Disney Sea and queues were long.
Again everything is in Japanese and very few people can speak more than a word in English. For a big organisation like Disney I‚Äôd expect part of the job description to be able to get by in English. Most countries that have their own language speak English as the second language so would be able to get by better. The only attraction that offered us a kind of tablet with a translation on was the tiki rooms.
I don‚Äôt think there was anything unique about this park which is a shame as it would have been nice to have some Japanese themed rides and section.

One thing I would really comment on is that Japanese people are very polite and the weather is nice. Their queues are very organised and you don't have people attempting to cut the line.
There is also a fair amount of events and happenings ( disney characters) coming out to take pictures with children. Most of them do really look like the characters in Disney and that is an amazing makeup skill.","Written May 27, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

After about an hour I realised it was a business not a magical place, maybe this was my Easter Bunny moment...

We were there mid week so the number of people wasn't overwhelming yet we waited 25-40 minutes for each attraction, fastpass or not, and once in the attraction it was over in 5-10 minutes....

Part of the park was closed so we didn't get a chance to line up for Splash Mountain...

I looked and looked for Mickey Mouse, I was hoping to see him roaming the streets and eventually found his house, there was a 50 minute wait to see him so I gave that a miss...

We arrived soon after opening and stayed till after the evening light parade. Food and drinks were about double the cost of fast food outside the Park and very limited menu selections, didn't find any vegetarian main meals...

We bought tickets there, as the only online ticket options required us to print it out (universal studios in osaka can scan a mobile voucher why cant disneyland?). Luckily the line wasnt very long to buy tickets. We ended up getting there about 9.30 (opening was 9am that day).

We had heard how busy it can be, and made sure to time our visit on a weekday to avoid the bigger crowds. There were still large crowds but the lines were all pretty manageable. We managed to get a few fast passes for some of the longer waits so we could go do other things. Despite reading warnings about how early the fast passes run out, we managed to get one last one for space mountain at about 6pm (for 9pm). I guess it was a quieter day and less people were using them.

Its all in Japanese of course, so we focused on the rides rather than the shows. They are all mostly aimed at the younger crowd, space mountain was about as thrill seeking as it got. If you want the bigger rollercoasters etc universal studios in osaka is much better.

We still had a fabulous time and managed to pretty much do all the rides we wanted (and a few twice). Plenty to entertain for all ages.

Food was as usual expensive as per theme parks, and not particularly impressive (we didnt go to any of the fancier sit down restaurants so cant comment on them).

The night parade was just spectacular (if you arent interested in the parades be warned they have to close off the street so you may get stuck on the wrong side trying to get to a ride for a little while).

Strollers are available for rental at a fee. There are plenty of stroller parks outside of each ride.

As it was my first visit, I did not know how the fast pass work and only realised almost towards end of my visit after googling online. I tried asking the staff near the fast pass machine but non of us understand each other as she spoke japanese and i speak english.

The fast pass is free for all visitors. You will need to go to the fast pass machine for those popular rides and scan your admission ticket. A tag with the allocated time for your ride will be issued. You can then go for other rides while you wait for the allocated time to visit the ride that you took the fast pass. Hope this info helps.

The rides are fun but some have height restriction. Stay for the night parade as the night comes alive with the neon lights.

265,Touch of magic,"How does one rate Disneyland? Put it simply, it‚Äôs Disneyland period. It is where magic, and all things wonderful and happy lives.

No matter how old or young; how many times; or how many Disneyland one has visited, nothing matters once you get there.

To be honest, I have never been to one myself and so the first time is always going to be unique and I haven‚Äôt got the luxury to compare to others in the world. But what I can say about Tokyo Disneyland is that it is extremely well organised and especially with crowd, they are also well managed.

Whilst every review and advise is to get to the park early, and to get to the fast passes, I personally think one can go there at a reasonable hour and agree that fast passes should be obtained as soon as possible but one may find themselves lucky to get in line and move along nicely. There may be a slight wait, but often than not, it is not a massive long wait.

The only turn off is the fact that most rides or featured display are stated in Japanese. Understandably that it is Disneyland in Japan, and the language of the country should be respected, but for visitors, it lost a bit of the thrill when they can‚Äôt understand a word.

The parades in the day and night is also magnificent. The night ones is an awesome display of colours and lights.

Food in the park varies from proper restaurant to the larger fast food type. In my opinion, the fast food option isn‚Äôt as worth the money as if you go to one of the restaurants. And these restaurants can be pre-reserved so it is highly recommend that when you first enter the park, check the map and decide on one so that you can make that booking at your preferred time.","Written May 18, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

269,"Worst Disney Park visit (poor character interaction, long lines for everything and just plain confusing)","My partner and I went to visit Disneyland and Disney SEA. I had researched the park and had heard quite good things about it. Many said they had some of the best rides and parades they‚Äôve ever seen. I had also heard about many rare character opportunities. I am an ex-Cast Member of WDW and have also been to Disneyland. My partner has visited WDW, Disneyland (CA), Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. I also speak a little bit of Japanese. Enough to get me by. So I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre pretty qualified to an opinion on this park.

With high hopes we arrived at the monorail station. We were surprised that you had to pay money to hop on the monorail as the monorail is free at other parks. The signage wasn‚Äôt very clear but we made our way to Disney SEA on the first day. The park was over crowded. We entered at park open and the lines were already at 3 hours. WDW‚Äôs Pandora lines are nothing compared to these lines!

The only park maps at the entrance are in Japanese. We didn‚Äôt find out until the end of the day that you had to REALLY LOOK for the maps that were in other languages. Whereas in WDW maps in 7 different languages are right in front of you when you enter the park.

We lined up for an hour at the Raging Spirits ride in hopes that the fast pass line would die down so that we could secure one. We managed to secure one at 12:45pm so we were pretty happy with that. However we were disappointed to find out that we had to wait 2 hours until we could get our next fast pass (meaning they would probably all run out).

And surprise surprise. We checked on a website (because foreigners can‚Äôt use the Tokyo Disney app) all the fast passes had run out. Except for Tower of Terror! We ran there and tried to scan our fast passes. They said we had to wait 3 minutes until we could get one and told us to wait to the side. Then they let a bunch of people in and they took the remaining fast passes and they closed the kiosk within 30 seconds.

We went on the Raging Spirits ride and it was quite a disappointment. Not a lot of theming and quite a low thrill level (despite being advertised as a thrill ride). At this point we hadn‚Äôt seen any characters, lines for food and toilets were half an hour long and the ride lines were even longer. We lined up for 3 hrs and 15 minutes for Journey to the Centre. Was a fantastic ride and would say it was the best experience we had so far.

As we decided to leave, we saw three of the Aristocats characters. But they were swarmed with people (apparently lines for pop up characters aren‚Äôt a thing). We also popped into a store and bought some Duffy merch. We held off on some of our purchases as we thought there‚Äôd be more in the main park (we had seen people with other merch that wasn‚Äôt in the stores). To our dismay, there was no way to know that Duffy merch was only available in Disney SEA. We only discovered that once we went to Disneyland the next day.

When we went to Disneyland we thought we were much more prepared after experiencing the disappointment that was Disney SEA. Disneyland was a much smaller version of Disneyland CA or Magic Kingdom. The layout was similar, but a little different in some ways. At this park we only managed to ride Star Tours and watch the half Japanese and half English Country Bear Jamboree (which we really appreciate the addition of English!). But alas it had the same issues. Ridiculous lines, rude people and no English whatsoever.

The one redeeming factor was that they had rare characters at the entrance at all times. But the way they did it was VERY strange. Face characters had lines. However fur characters had swarms of people. No lines. And you had to wait for the character to pick you for a photo. Which was an issue because you‚Äôd have people pushing you backwards trying to yell at the character for their attention. I went to get a photo with Eeyore and thankfully it didn‚Äôt take too long for me to get chosen! I went in for a hug and I guess Eeyore didn‚Äôt feel like hugs that day (I don‚Äôt think hugging is big in Japan). I didn‚Äôt let that bother me as I understand there can be cultural differences. However there was no character interaction whatsoever. Even when I spoke in Japanese.

I ended up meeting Clarice later on. She was much more welcoming, however it took about half an hour to get a photo as parents would push their children at her feet, almost tripping her over! As an ex-entertainment CM I was shocked that the character attendants did NOTHING to stop this.

It was quite the disappointment. Normally my partner and I are at parks from open until close. However we ended up leaving early on both days as it was just far too hectic. Want shorter lines? Visit Disneyland CA on New Years Eve. Will be half the craziness!

Would 100% recommend skipping Tokyo Disney. Go to Disneyland CA or WDW instead.","Written May 13, 2019",1.0 of 5 bubbles
270,Make Disneyland a must do in Japan,"We visit Disneyland every time we come to japan from when our children were 8 months til our most recent trip where they are now 7, Disneyland has a great range of rides and attractions to suit different ages. Take your own lunch and buy snacks from the endless popcorn vendors or other snack carts. Lots of opportunity to meet Disney characters but lines tend to be long and we skip these, preferring to get onto rides. Make good use of fast pass ticketing to avoid very long queues on popular rides.","Written May 12, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
271,Make sure you read all the blogs and guides you can find online!,"We went as a family of 4 (parents with 1 schooler and toddler), went during what was considered low season (7-9 May, Tue-Thu) and enjoyed pretty much 1.5 days in Disneyland (we bought 3-days magicpass and park hop on the third day).

Even during a low season, queues can vary from 5-90 min. We were considered lucky and managed to take a few rides with waiting time below 15 min. Nevertheless, we skipped those thrill rides since we were with the young kids.

Plan well, read all the blogs and guides you can find online (we did spent quite significant time on this) if you want to enjoy the themepark with less fuss.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the facility was clean, plenty of benches all over the park. As a parent, I would advise bringing a picnic mat or a light portable stool (we saw locals doing that), so one may sit in queue, rest on the ground while waiting for the parade or show.

May can still be chilly by the evening so do bring jumpers or wind-breakers.

Can't say enough about reading more and planning well - otherwise, one can easily waste an entire day and not achieving much.","Written May 12, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

It is crowded compared to even the US parks but if you do your research and plan well, you'll have a great time.","Written May 7, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

I then purchased tickets through Viator.com only to have the tickets not recognised at the gate, all this mind you after lining up since 7am in order to purchase their fast pass tickets. Subsequently we lost our position in the queue and my young daughter was left in tears. I did not find the Tokyo Disneyland staff particularly helpful or sympathetic to our plight. The only staff member who came to help us addressed us with ""I don't speak English"". Luckily I speak Japanese and was also with a Japanese friend who explained the situation to her - fruitlessly as it turns out.

I highly recommend getting a snack and lining up 1 hour before the parade starts for a great viewing spot.","Written April 30, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
280,Well worth it,The family had a great day on the rides. Best advice is to get the Fast track tickets. You can get them every two hours. This enables you to get entry to the ride at a specific time frame and jump the normal queue. Only certain rides have them and certain one go quickly. Highly recommend the space rides and the gold mine roller coaster. Food was reasonably priced for a theme park but would suggest eating around 11am to avoid the crowds. We didn‚Äôt prepurchase the tickets and went on a Tuesday which is one of the more quieter days. One of us went to the ticket counter whilst the rest of the family waited in the entry line. Suggest you get there well ahead of opening time.,"Written April 29, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
281,Technical problems,"We visited Disneyland on a Wednesday and found that it was quite busy despite being a weekday. The park was easy to get to from Tokyo station by metro. We arrived around midday and there was a very small queue to buy tickets which was a nice surprise.

Once inside, we rushed to the Monsters Inc ride - being one of the most popular rides here, we wanted to get a Fast Pass. Unfortunately the ride was closed unexpectedly due to technical issues, which was disappointing. We were advised to keep checking back during the day, which we did although it meant that this was time we could have used elsewhere in the park. It did open again but then closed a few times too - the queue was at least an hour long and they did not allow Fast Pass access. We eventually went on the ride at the end of the day after the fireworks, when the queue was much smaller.

The park itself was clean and the staff were all very friendly. We enjoyed watching the parades from the Tomorrowland area - the Disney castle was therefore in the background and made for great photos. The fireworks display at the end of the day was disappointing compared to other Disney parks as it did not last long.

All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the day and would certainly return.

A few tips:
- They have special stickers to wear for special occasions, available at Guest Relations (eg birthday).
- The park map has a useful summary of all of the eateries and the kind of food they sell. Saves time so you know what to look for. Highly recommend the strawberry churros at Critter Country!
- You can check in advance on the website what attractions etc will be closed for refurbishment and when.","Written April 29, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
282,Disney Mad Crush Not a Great Experience,"Went on the 5th April and it was an absolute mad scramble. Although not during school holidays and during weekday, the number of people queuing up by 7:30am was enormous. We could not work out which queue was for tickets and which was for entry.

When the gates opened, it was like the running of the bulls at Pamplona and many people running in with heaps of pushing and shoving. After seeing many young kids cry near the Buzz light year ride to shoot those aliens, I really did question why one would want to bring their child here.

It is impossible to get on every ride in one day and using the fastpass system allows you get on more than you would. It very much is catered to locals with many having a yearly pass.

I was also surprised that people start hogging spots for the parade from 10am in the morning and it creates a hazard and slows you down. Frankly Disney should stop people squatting for seats so early.

My tip is run for the furthest rides away from the entry that are good and then move to get your first fastpass while you line up for your next ride and then just repeat getting fastpasses when you can for the big rides.

However by 1pm, many attractions have already closed for fastpasses. For example Thunder mountain ride fastpass obtained at 11am was for a ride at 5pm.

Tells you that Disney are admitting too many people in one day to be able to enjoy the experience.

The night is a massive crush to, so you are better off watching the parade from the Western World. Restaurant food - you are also looking at at least 800Yen per person over and probably closer to 1,300Yen for a proper meal and that's not even in the top notch restaurant.","Written April 28, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles

The wait for popular rides is usually over an hour if you don‚Äôt use the fast pass system. Scan your entry ticket once per hour at the fast pass booths next to the ride and in an hour or so you can join the fast line which moves much faster.
I found it best to get your fast pass as soon as you get off each ride and enjoy some side shows in between to ensure you spend as little time in lines as possible.","Written April 28, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

287,Disappointing & sometimes heartless,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland & DisneySea on two consecutive days in April. The parks themselves are beautifully done and spotless. We visited on workdays hoping for smaller crowds but both parks were completely overcrowded, which meant that even the rides for very small children had incredibly long lines. We ended up waiting behind hoards of teenagers (?) for small children‚Äôs rides that essentially lasted five seconds. No seriously, some of the rides were so short it was ridiculous!
My daughter (5) also experienced some things that were unforgivable in my eyes, being pushed out of the way by hoards of teenagers to get up to a disney character. This of course isn‚Äôt the park‚Äôs fault but the ‚Äòdisney character‚Äô in question did nothing to right the wrong and she was ignored for 5 minutes before we eventually gave up! We also got up to a long line of grownups (!) waiting to take a picture with mickey mouse, we proceeded to the back of the line, as my daughter was really excited about having her picture taken with Mickey but a rude lady did a cross with her arms and said ‚Äúno!‚Äù. I asked her if she was really going to send away a little girl and she just gave a heartless ‚Äúyes!‚Äù. So much for the magic of Disney! In other parks it‚Äôs all about the kids but this was really lost here! The woman‚Äôs response brings me to my next point, the lack of English. Many staff members speak next to no English and there are NO subtitles on ANY of the rides. We found this really lazy and as it‚Äôs an easy fix, we‚Äôre not sure why nothing has been done about this! We‚Äôre from Switzerland and regularly go to a park in Germany that manages to do everything in 3 languages, so it can be done! Essentially it wasn‚Äôt as magical as we were hoping for! :(","Written April 26, 2019",2.0 of 5 bubbles

When you book from abroad, Tokyo Disneyland does not make it easy to purchase tickets. There is no on line support/chat for international travellers -- only by phone.

291,Fantastic Family Day,"Three adults and two small children tackled the crowds early in April. It was the day before the school holidays started but it was definitely crowded. However, we did expect this and planned ahead - which meant rushing to the popular rides first, then taking our time walking around, taking photos and eating. It was a great day, beautiful weather but the two boys were exhausted. We booked our tickets on line, not easy to do from Australia we discovered but there was absolutely no one in the queue to buy tickets on the day! So we could have got tickets on the day. We also elected to get a car and driver to take us there and pick us up - expensive yes but very handy at 6pm with two exhausted boys who fell asleep on the drive home. We also got there at 7.45am - early and we expected to beat the crowds but I think everyone had the same idea. Park opens at 8am and it was crowded! The Dumbo ride was a minute long and was not worth the over an hour wait, but the Star Tours ride was excellent, Buzz Lightyears Astro Blasters was very good, Monsters Inc Ride and Go Seek was ok, Peter Pan's Flight was good and Tom Sawyer's Island was a nice respite. Overall it was a fun day. Disneyland is aimed at a younger audience (the boys were 8 & 4) and it was good for them. Take a back pack, wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to queue.","Written April 23, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

300,"Disneyland, the safest choice","This was the final Disney park I had to visit on my quest to having been to all Disney resorts in the World.

After a little disappointing day at the DisneySea (see my other review), this made us feel back home and happy again.

Specially doing the classic rides Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain gave us the Disney experience we wanted. And the night light parade was amazing!

There are some things they should do something about to make it even better in my eyes:
1) I know this is a Japanese park, but this is the only park in the world with next to no English on their rides. Thus making the dark rides almost useless, and a little more difficult for international visitors.

2) They MUST do something about how many people they let in! There actually must be a way to have a full capacity and sell out because it was really over crowded. This was even on a regular weekday and we were told it is twice as many during the weekends, which must be unbearable. Tokyo is a huge city and most people can afford the steap Disney prices so something needs to be done!

3) The official Disney stores products both inside and outside the park was not up to standard. On every single Disney we've been to in the world the suitcase have been filled with quality Disney merch such as limited edition artwork etc. This was not to be found at any stores in Tokyo, although we found some better quality products at the Disney Store in Shibuya.","Written April 19, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles

The It's a Small World ride was a strange one, go on it if you want the song stuck in your head for the next year and if you want to feel like Lisa Simpson when she was tripping. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was pretty good too. The parade is a must to watch, day and night. Plenty of characters wandering around, they do get mobbed but as the park wasn't crazy busy we managed to get some photos with them. Food was pretty good, there's a good selection available including for fussy kids. We especially loved the Mickey Mouse mini pizzas. It was a shame that some rides were closed in Toon Town while we were there, my husband was very sad he couldn't go on the Roger Rabbit ride lol. If you go in winter make sure you stop in the jail in Toon Town, there are heater vents which are delightful to stand under and defrost! Merch is expensive, as one would expect, but there is a big variety. Overall a fab place to spend a day/evening. We all loved it!

Since my kids are still young we just rode the jungle train, boat ride, mark twain boat, we watched the 3d show and we ate a lot of mickey mouse food. Then it was time for souvenir shopping while waiting for the parade to start. It was still a cold day in Tokyo but definitely a memorable day for my whole family.","Written April 8, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles
319,Great family fun day,"Get in line early (we were in line an hour before opening). Possibly send someone to get fast passes while the rest of the group gets in line. (I would suggest splash mountain, Winnie the Pooh, space mountain, or thunder mountain railroad, depending on your group). Parks was beautiful, but crowded. Be prepared to wait and be patient.","Written April 7, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
320,Disneyland Tokyo,"Amazing

Highlights are the shows and parades

One mans dream 2 was well worth the visit and a great show that would be popular at any Disneyland resort

The parades are better than those in the states with the best electrical parade ever. You can view with ease and there was no need to camp out on the route for a good spot despite many people sitting hours before the parade starts. In Japan a lot of people sit on the floor during the parade so if you don‚Äôt mind standing away from the parade you can find a spot that over looks the crowd.

Don‚Äôt expect to do everything, the parks are very busy. Get there earlier to get fast passes for the most popular rides as the fast passes close once all are distributed for the day and for the most popular rides this can be by mid day. Rides such as Winnie the poo, monsters inc., thunder mountain, space mountain.

If the parks are open until 10, as they were in our visit, you can get on some of the other rides with ease. Our first day we were able to ride tiki rooms, bear jamboree, Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Snow White, small world, jungle cruise, haunted mansion and roger rabbit with ease.

There are long queues for quick service and stalls, but if you are as happy with less popular options then you can get served quickly

There is a band that plays on Main Street that is a must if you can catch them. Again better than any spontaneous show in Disneyland California, florida or Paris.

Super friendly and helpful staff, great customer service. What ever japanese people tap in to for this should be bottled and sprinkled over the other parks around the world. I was touched by their smiles and kindnesses adding to magic

Even though I could not understand what was said on the jungle cruise the cast member was really convincing funny and had amazing energy. The grotto that you go through mid ride has excellent effects not experienced in any other park listed above.

We had a four day park ticket. We were surprised, having read reviews we thought we would like Disney seas better, separate review. Although we loved it, we were drawn back to Disneyland more often. Our visit was Sunday Monday Tuesday and Wednesday. Surprisingly The Wednesday was the busiest. The start of their Easter event that is very popular in Japan

322,Fun Date Place,"This place is really wonderful for couples which is ironic because in the US it's more for family and friends. The ticket price particularly for afternoon admission is a real bargain.

I went here with my boyfriend, and I had a great time. Everything is really cute, and the alien ice cream mochi are super cool.

We went on a really cold day, but we still had a ton of fun watching the parade. And I would really recommend the Stitch show. It was hilarious particularly to adults.

The park is very English friendly if you need to speak English. The only real drawback are the lines. The lines are pretty intense unless you go on a weekday which kind of sucks. Because the lines at the Florida one are so much shorter.

A 3 hour wait time just isn't that unusual. But if you're willing to split up the single rider lines are awesome. The Buzz Lightyear ride was awesome as always. And Pooh's Honey Hunt, It's a small World, and the Haunted Mansion were all worth seeing.

Everyone should go.","Written April 4, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

We aimed for attractions with a maximum 35 minute wait, with young kids we just couldn‚Äôt justify 3 hour wait times. We even waited 30 minutes for popcorn, it was so hard to get food or a seating area.
Great facilities, we enjoyed the different sections and themes, the parade for 35th birthday was fantastic as was the evening parade with floats and characters lit up.

We spent two days in each park. We are Disney nuts and loved it!
Highly recommend getting tickets in advance and getting there early. Head to back of the park as soon as you get in and work towards the front to avoid the long queues.
The lines are really short after it gets dark. Loved trying all the different flavour popcorn.
Winnie the Pooh ride isn‚Äôt like USA parks, can see the parades from the line up to Winnie the Pooh.
Electrical Parade was great and enjoyed the Queen of Hearts Banquet hall (no reservations required)

329,Worse Disneyland place,"I visited all Disneyland parks around the world and I can say this is the worst one, long line for ticket no VIP tickets, long line for food, no good attactions and no Disneyland castle which surprised us, we will never return back to this place.","Written March 27, 2019",2.0 of 5 bubbles
330,Plan plan plan and run run run,"I have visited several Disney parks over the years. Whilst no expert, I understand better than many as to what you should and shouldn't do to get the most out of your visit. No matter what you hear or research...NOTHING can prepare you for the crowds and lining up required at both Disneyland and Disneysea.
We chose a Tuesday for Disneyland and a Wednesday for Disneysea. There was nothing special about this week - it was not a holiday or busy week in Tokyo. It was classed as a moderately busy period on the Disney calendar. Even at almost an hour before park opening time there were easily already one thousand ticket holders lining up ahead of us. This truly surprised me as in my experience a similar Tuesday at Anaheim doesn‚Äôt draw this kind of line an hour before opening.
It does not stop there‚Ä¶.. Once inside, you line up for a lengthy period for almost everything from attractions, parades, and food - even 45 minutes for a cup of coffee. I will note we did not need to line up to use the bathroom at any time which was great (and a welcomed surprise to be honest). I even saw several groups of people setting themselves up to watch the parade - over three hours before the parade starting time.
We are two healthy men and could race around the park easily so we still managed to make the most out of our day and have a terrific time. I seriously don‚Äôt know how all of you with children manage it - you truly are miracle workers.
The park is very clean and runs very smoothly. It has a great Disney atmosphere and all cast members we encountered were happy and helpful. I do think they need to think about adding some coffee carts rather than coffee only being available at the cafes to hopefully reduce the long wait for such a simple purchase.
Here are some tips (some are bleedingly obvious but to a novice maybe not):
Note: How you spend your first hour is crucial and sets up the rest of your day for success or potential disappointment
Buy your tickets in advance - either online or via a registered seller in Tokyo
Get there at LEAST one hour in advance before park opening
Whilst in line request a park and parade times brochure and start planning
Download TDR Alert which is an app that will show current wait times and whether they have a fastpass available.
Decide on your four MUST DO rides and work out a schedule. If any of them have a Fastpass available race to this attraction upon entry to get a return pass for it and then over to the next closest attraction on your list. Hopefully it will still only be a 5 - 15 minute wait and you can ride this and possibly still go onto the next ride on your list all within the first hour.
Pay close attention to the time on your fastpass ticket that tells you when you can get a second fastpass for another ride. If this time is BEFORE the return time of your first fastpass get your second fastpass BEFORE returning to your first fastpass ride.
Try not to get distracted in this first hour. Pay no attention to any shops or characters that are there to divert your attention. It is vital you get your big four done first up. Then you can relax somewhat for the rest of the day.
Pack some snacks that will help you all until meal breaks. Consider having meal breaks a little bit earlier or later than normal. For lunch consider 11am over 12 noon, or 4.30pm instead of 6.30pm.
Rides such as ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs A Small World‚Äô, ‚ÄòCastle Carousel‚Äô and ‚ÄòPirates of the Caribbean‚Äô appear to have fairly small wait times so I advise you to add these to your list later in the day. It helps give more bang for your buck.","Written March 27, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

When wife arrives with child after toilet break (super long Q as i doubt TDR controlled the no. of visitors even they declared so), my wife was told the capacity is full and disallowed to enter. That's fine. I asked the staff to let my child sit on my lap without disturbing anyone with wife waiting outside. Again was rejected. Seeing the disappointment of my child, i asked the staff and manager tolet my child enter by herself. Again, rejected as my 6yo child is not meeting age requirement. Then, i suggested my child stand from the back to see the show, within leaving our sight. Again,TDR staff said so sorry... End up my whole family left with extreme disappointment with none wacthing the show even we have 1 seat. This was our 2nd day here but didnt even managed to see the show after 4th try. A terrible place with inconsiderate TDR staff. I highly recommend Hong Kong Disneyland over Tokyo. Will never visit TDR again.

It is Japan thou so no one was grumpy.
We would not bother with this trip again

however we noted during the time we were waiting that there. Is a fast pass available which we don‚Äôt know the cost of but those going through using those passes jumped the queues by at least a couple of hours. There should be info available to google

337,Longest waiting time was 3 hours.,"If you have whole day free time, the place will be good for you. As you know, you need to research the place ahead of time from their website. I would love to share efficient way to visit there.
First of all, please buy ticket from the online. Discount ticket only can purchase from the Website, please do not order ticket from website after you arrive in Japan. The company does not accept foreigners credit card on their website. So you need order your ticket before you depart your country. Depend on the situation, you can not purchase their ticket at the box office in TDL.
Second, as much as you can, please get Fast pass. You do not need wait more than 20 minutes.
Third, food sections also have long line, waiting time average 30 minutes to order. Please eat big breakfast and then visit there will be good for you. They are not allowed to bring your personal foods.
All those reasons, I will purchase fast pass package ticket next time. I hope you can enjoy with your friends and family. 30 minutes by car from Tokyo station.","Written March 18, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles
338,Terrible,"150 minute waits for rides, bad hot dogs and about 10,000 people more than the place could handle. The fast pass system is a joke, we only managed to reserve one before the system closed for the day (they make you wait several hours before you can reserve another and the good rides book out quickly).The roller coasters are very tame but that makes them good for young kids. On the good side, the locals seem to love it and the place is spotlessly clean and feels very safe. My tip is to bring good shoes because you will be doing lots of standing.","Written March 18, 2019",1.0 of 5 bubbles

340,First Disney Experience,"We went on the first Tuesday of March and it was busy. We went as a family of four with a 10month old in the pram and our 3 year old walking or sitting on dads shoulders when she needed a break. We did a bit of research in regards to fast passes and which rides we most wanted to go on before we went to Disneyland. We arrived 10mins before park opening and the lines were huge but don‚Äôt worry they move really quick, we were inside in about 5mins. My husband immediately went and collected a fastpass for the Winnie the Pooh ride and then we basically walked onto it‚Äôs a small world after all ride. This was a great ride, kids loved it. We all rode the Peter Pan ride (25min wait), baby included as well as the teacup ride (5min wait) and carousel ride (5min wait), skipped the dumbo ride which was a 35min wait which seemed excessive for the type of ride it was, although we did it the second day when it was raining a bit and wait time was only 5mins. Pooh was awesome and both kids loved it. Castle was fun to see inside, remember to use your flash when taking photos and some magic might happen. We did two days at Disneyland, which we needed and we still didn‚Äôt do everything. Adults favourite ride was Star Wars tour. Three year olds favourite ride was buzz lightyear Astro blasters which we did three times over two days. Monsters inc ride was also pretty good. The space mountain ride was very disappointing, don‚Äôt expect it to be very thrilling if you‚Äôre use to proper roller coasters. It was basically a very basic indoor roller coaster with flashy lights. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wasting time going on this ride or wasting a fastpass on it like I did. Save your fast passes for monsters inc, buzz lightyear ride and Pooh ride especially if you‚Äôve got kids. There‚Äôs a play area in toon town for kids to run around in. Favourite food was mickeys glove sandwich with Chinese chicken on and the lightsaber churro. Make sure to use fast passes and download english TDR ride times on your phone it was very good for checking ride times and fastpass return times. We stayed in the resort area so we could get to parks early without having to travel and to also go back to hotel throughout day for kids to have a rest. We stayed at Sheraton which was great. Do not miss the nighttime parade and light show on the castle. The daytime parade was skippable if you don‚Äôt have time. The night parade was the best parade I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. For the best seats get there at least 45mins before parade starts and pick out your spot. There will be massive lines for the more popular rides so use fast passes wisely. We went on average crowd day for both days we went apparently and for us it was still pretty busy. We really enjoyed our experience at Disneyland overall.","Written March 15, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

It was busy and crowds were everywhere, but the Japanese know how to move crowds, the main attractions had the biggest crowds but within an hour you were on a ride, make sure you get fastpass on your favourite ride as you‚Äôll go straight into the ride, you can only get one at a time and have to use it first before you get another one.

In any case the rides notify you at line up the expected wait time so you can decide before joining the queue if you are up for the wait. The staff were everywhere and very helpful, happy & smiley. We watched the night time parade which was hands down the best parade we‚Äôve ever seen, worth securing a spot on the route for.

It managed to make a pair of forty somethings feel like kids again with stylish rides and great shows. The queue times are an issue, making repeating popular rides like Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain impractical, but there's plenty to do still. The electric lights parade and the fireworks are a must see and we were lucky enough to catch the 35th anniversary show, which was amazing. The food available is okay and reasonably priced without being amazing and the park is incredibly clean. Would happily visit again. The only issue we had was our card not being accepted online so we had to buy a ticket on the day - Tokyo Disney, please sort out your payment portal as this was a real hassle.","Written March 11, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Positive
- much bigger than Hongkong
- Mickey Disney character shaped ice cream
- Much better crowd controlled for the nightly fire works display, march pass & shows
- get to visit and go up the Disney tower
- water dispensers sparsely located near outdoor activity lines
- FREE fast pass located at entrance of some activity
- many retail stores for die hard souvenir fans with views of actual glass shaped makers
- allowed us to bring in water bottle & middle sized knapsack full of food & chips though we were searched at the entrance. Don‚Äôt know if we were lucky as their website says one ‚ÄúMAY‚Äù not. üòÖ
- activity brochures are in many languages & even Bahasa M‚Äôsia
- many come mildly dressed & yes even adults in their favorite characters

Negative
- directions & explanations are in Japanese mostly though a couple have English; no fault of theirs as the park crowd are mainly the locals.
- can‚Äôt finish everything in a day if one doesn‚Äôt arrive early

Clean environment and interesting shops, restaurants and rides. Queue can be long for some rides.

We especially liked the parades. There is a parade during the day and a night time parade which is really colourful. Try and catch both the parades as well as the fireworks at the end of the night. One thing which we found strange was that the fireworks should have come immediately after the night parade. But instead, we had to wait another half hour to see the short fireworks display.

It was a little too cold for some of us as it was winter. Probably better to come during better weather like spring or autumn.","Written March 9, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

The visit included a very early morning train up to Tokyo, change train to subway about 1.5 hrs total ( and return at days end). It was a fantastic day, we all had the best time. Kids beside themselves with excitement and the thrill. I purchased the tickets within Japan ( I am a non Japanese speaking nonna) and I used a machine at our local Chigasaki 7 eleven, with a little in store help. Absolutely no problem.
We availed ourselves of the Fast Pass System for rides etc when possible, it saves queuing....
Plenty of food and drink and bathroom options everywhere. One day is probably not enough time, but we did our best to see and do, keeping in mind our little fellow travelers. Our train journey home we used the Green Car option on JR as sure to get a seat for the kids, and can eat and drink...we bought snacks at Tokyo Station for trip home.

This turned out to be a good thing, as each time they did it and were happy I got to jump 1/3 of the line and my wife and daughter got to come too. On Hyperspace mountain avoid the front row of each card, again the staff will likely call this out to you when you join the line.

362,We had fun for slightly more than two days here.,"We bought the vacation package which includes a certain amount of fast passes. Therefore, we need not join the public to queue for certain time slot‚Äôs fast passes for those popular rides. My girl‚Äôs current height is more suitable for Disneyland, in comparison to DisneySea.
She is very happy that she is guaranteed entry (as she is a guest at the Disney hotels) even on crowded days, also the fact that the fast passes we had can be used at any time slot (during the operation timing of the park) and skipped the long waiting time (we still need to wait but much much faster than those who do not have fast passes...for example, the normal waiting time for those without fast passes will be 90mins while we only waited about 15mins).
We bought lots of popcorn holders (different themes) and tasted at least 3 different flavours out of the available flavours.
I purposely arranged this trip to tap on the 35th anniversary before it ends on mid March this year but the popcorn holder (Mickey Mouse with the 35th anniversary symbol) was sold out.
But well, i managed to get the other ornament item which strongly signifies this anniversary, so I am still contented.
I personally strongly encourage families with young children to consider purchasing the vacation package (no such package for Hong Kong Disneyland which we went in October 2016), as it brings lots of convenience despite that my husband and I do not understand Japanese and speak extremely limited Japanese.","Written February 26, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

But the part that saddened us the most what when I asked a cast member what the new wait time was for the line since the posted time was not at the end of the actual line, she looked at me as if we were bothering her and then walked away.","Written February 22, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles
366,Loved it!!! From a California Disneyland Purist,"I'm a huge Disney fan and I've been to the original Disneyland in California at least a dozen times over the years (plus Disney World once). I wasn't sure what to expect with my first visit to a international Disney park, but Tokyo Disney exceeded all of my expectations.
To summarize: Tokyo Disney is incredibly detailed, has great unique rides only found in Japan, has much better food than the American parks, and the staff was friendly and amazing. Tokyo Disney does a great job of capturing the magic found in the original Disneyland.

Hints for first time visitors:
Tokyo Disney has great (only found in Japan) rides like Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monsters Inc, plus a new Beauty and the Beast Ride opening in 2020 that looks amazing!
They also have most of the famous Disney rides found in other parks: Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, the Haunted House, Its a Small World, Peter Pan, Roger Rabbit, Star Tours, Jungle Cruise, Buzz Lightyear, Etc.
Make sure to utilize fastpass tickets to avoid long lines.
The park is very popular, and can get crazy busy, so avoid holidays, weekends, and try to go on a weekday.
Pirates of the Caribbean isn't very popular in Japan, and normally has a 5-10 minute wait. Still a great ride.
Buy your tickets online beforehand to skip the line.
Try the food: It is so much better than the food in the American Parks. They have crazy flavors of popcorn (like Curry), teriyaki chicken legs, seafood pizza, good ramen, and countless crazy desserts.
Disney Sea is a separate park located across the street, you need a separate admission ticket to enter it. It has the awesome Indiana Jones ride, Tower of Terror, Toy Story Mania and other fun rides. Their is no hopper pass to run back and forth between the parks like in California.

My only criticisms: Their Tomorrowland had a very dated feel to it, it did contain all the great rides (Space Mountain, Star Wars, Buzz Lightyear). But it just felt weak in details compared to the rest of the park.
Also, their Adventure Land only contained 2 rides, and didn't contain The Indiana Jones ride (they do have Indiana Jones at Disney Sea across the street), which left only the train and the Jungle Cruise. Adventure Land could really use a big E-ticket attraction.

Highly recommend a visit for any Disney fans.","Written February 20, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

369,Hectic but Fun,"Our 2nd DL after Paris. Our kids are 10 & 8 and I think next time we will visit Disney Sea as the rides in DL I think are more geared up towards younger kids. We spent 100mins queuing for both Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain which really eats into your day, but these were the two most ""exciting"" rides available that day in the Park. We managed to get a Fast Pass for Pooh's Hunny Hunt so we saved 60mins there.

Top tip is that I would recommend that you buy your tickets BEFORE you arrive at the Park, otherwise you'll be double queuing (once for tickets and then once to get in).

We stayed in Odaiba which wasn't too far away and had good attractions / shopping / food for the kids. What I didn't know and the really helped was finding out that LAWSONS or FAMILY MART (convenience stores - you'll find them everywhere) sell Disneyland tickets (there's a machine near the door, I just asked the staff member to help me buy tickets). This was awesome as it made buying the tickets super easy and convenient.

372,Amazing!,"We visited the park for one day whilst visiting Tokyo. I personally found the park, the attractions and the food so much better than Disney Hong Kong and Disney Shanghai. For me, Disney Tokyo is on par with Disney in Paris.

Picking up our tickets was a strange experience, we collected them in the airport on our arrival before going to disneyland the next day! If visiting please be mindful of this as European guests who have been to Paris might think you collect your pre-paid tickets from Disneyland on the day you visit.

Very enjoyable experience, although it was very cold and wet at times in February. Please wrap up warm is visiting in winter, also strong, waterproof, comfy footwear is a must! A lot of walking will be done if you want to see everything. Also prepare for a very long day, we left our Tokyo hotel at 5am and got hone at midnight! The subway us quite easy to work out so no taxi required.

The park was very busy which reflected its popularity. All the staff were very kind and helpful. I think this was the cleanest themepark I have ever visited! The shops are great, be sure to leave enough time to check them out. There is a disney village type place nearby however there is nothing disney there, apart from the largest Disney store in Tokyo I believe (which I found to be quite average-sized and chaotic), I would actually avoid!

I would definitely visit again if staying in Tokyo.","Written February 12, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The Cast Members here are also extraordinarily friendly and a joy to be around. The shows are absolutely incredible and the atmosphere gatherings are nothing to turn your nose up at! You absolutely have to try as much food from the stands around the park as you can (especially all the different flavors of popcorn and maybe a seasonal churro)!

We were concerned that it would be too crowded having read the reviews. It was busy, but by using the fast passes we managed to ride everything we wanted without waiting in too many long lines. We visited on a Monday and Wednesday.

383,Great time,"Great time, for a Disneyland experience in Tokyo.

I wasn't sure what to expect, with only gone to the one in Florida.
The price for one day was roughly $80 American. Which is less than what you would pay in Florida or California. At least half the price, compared to the one in Florida.

The park is setup beautifully but the park does get extremely busy. But really no different than what I experienced when I was in Florida. The announcements also go out in English as well, if anyone might be wondering. You will also see people cosplaying as their favorite characters from Disney walking around. And if you ask them, they will gladly take a photo with you.

Disney does a bang up job on making everyone have a great experience. Even in Japan.
And I do mean everyone. Even the staff that clean the park are very friendly, courteous, and very helpful.

As I was lining up for the Space Mountain ride, one of the staff members who's English was pretty good, warned me about the seat height, and that I may have to scooch down a bit. Which was very nice and helpful. Since I stand at 6'-2"" (188cm).

They had parades going through the park a few times a day and a couple at night.
The night parade was beautiful.

I'm glad I went there for the experience.

Having been to Tokyo Disneyland approximately 20 years ago, I knew it wasn't as big as Anaheim (which we visited 6 years ago), but it was still a great experience. I do feel it lacked a little of that Disney ""magic"". Maybe it was because the characters were not roaming. Having said that, we did visit during the July heatwave, so that is understandable.

394,Really crowded and the rides are better at Disneysea,"We've visited Disneysea the past 2 years but haven't been to Tokyo Disneyland in about 18 years, so it would be our younger son's first time there. All the advice I've read said to be there early so we arrived about 7:15 for the 8:00am opening. There must have been at least 40 people in front of us in one of the shorter lines to the entrance! People do get up super early to stand in line at Disneyland!

Our first stop when the park opened (no announcement or rope drop here!) was the fast pass for Monsters Inc ride, which I think is only at this Disneyland. By the time we got there, it was already the 11:15 fast pass. Then we went to Space Mountain and the line there was 1/2 hr. One thing to note about Space Mountain at this Disneyland, there is NO music on the ride! It was so disappointing since that is one of my favorite parts of this ride. After Space Mountain, we went to Pirates ride (same as the US version) which had a 10 minute wait, the Star Tours ride (different endings like the US Disneyland) - 10 minute wait, and Haunted Mansion (It was the Night before Christmas version) - 1/2 hr wait. We also got a Big Thunder fast pass for 1:00pm.

Monster's Inc ride was okay. The ride is built like the Buzz Lightyear ride and instead of shooting targets, you shine flashlights at targets. But there is no score so after a little bit, it got sort of boring. Maybe it's fun for little kids, but the lines here are the longest in the park so I don't think it's worth lining up for more than once. It's better if you have a fast pass but those run out quite early.

Lunch was at Plasma Ray's since it was one of the few places that offered vegetarian food. The vegetable curry we got was decent and the prices were ok for Disney. We also picked up a Darth Vader popcorn bucket and got a coupon for popcorn at another popcorn stand (corn potage popcorn did not sound appetizing but was popular).

Before Big Thunder fast pass was good, we also got a fast pass for It's a Small World ride. That was a big surprise since that ride usually doesn't have much of a line anywhere else in the world. The standby line was over 1/2 hr so we used the fast pass thinking maybe it's different from other It's a Small World rides. No, it's the same, just with a long line!

We were at Disneyland on Dec 31st so it closed at 5pm to get ready for their New Year's Eve event. We think it wasn't very crowded that day (max line was about 70 minutes when it could go up to 140 minutes on popular days) but it still felt crowded. Unfortunately, when we tried to use our fast pass for Big Thunder, it was temporarily closed so we decided to leave the park. On the way out, we saw the parade. Nice parade but nothing memorable.

I have read that Disneyland Tokyo can be very crowded; I bought a 3-day pass, look-up the crowd calendar and chose to visit from Tuesday to Thursday with the least crowd. But still, it is very crowded for all 3 days. I can't imagine if its a weekend.

Tokyo Disneyland's character meeting & photo-taking is somehow different from other countries. Unless you are going to the ""official & proper"" character meet & greet located at their shack , the ""ad-hoc"" characters that pops up in the street doesn't have a proper queue. We see people crowding around the character and after a few times, we observed that there is no queue because the character picks the person to take picture with. So yah... wait for your turn to be picked. If you have kids, they will surely take a picture with you in no-time. All you need to do is call and wave at the character.

Tokyo Disneyland has many strict rules to abide as well. While waiting for the night parade, we opened up our foldable director chair in one corner where there is nobody behind us, the disney staff came over and say no and asked us to keep it. On 2nd occasion, my 9yo gal who is not tall was asked by the disney staff to come down from the bench that she was standing while my gal was stretching her neck trying to catch a glimpse of the light show at Cinderella Castle with all the tall adults in front of her. *rolls eyes*

We visited Disneyland Tokyo at the end of this December. We have mixed feelings. We definitely prefer the Disneyland at Anaheim due to the layout and atmosphere. What shocked us was the crowds.

We also went when it was freezing. So be prepared to line up in 6 degrees for an hour minimum. Due to the crowds we did not stay for the fireworks.

We arrived about 1pm and surprised at how short the queue to enter at the front gate was (that was the shortest queue of the day!).

When we arrived I noticed a couple of Disney characters there for photo opportunities - but we were keen to move on so didn‚Äôt stop. Bad move as we never saw any more the whole day (which disappointed my daughter).

Tokyo Disneyland crowds are like NYE everywhere. Even the toilet queue was long.

We heard about the Fast Pass option but unfortunately by the time we got there they were all sold out.

We only ended up queuing for a few rides which took 40 minutes each (and lots of patience with little ones). Other rides such as It‚Äôs A Small World said their queue was close to 100 minutes.

We went on Pirates of the Caribbean - and unfortunately the ride hasn‚Äôt changed much since I went to Disneyland 30 years ago.

It‚Äôs a very expensive day out (especially with all the shops that you pass by and end up after every rude). And by the end the kids were tired and grumpy.

In saying that - the kids still had a ball and have fond memories.

410,Worst theme park experience ever!,"I know that we must have chosen one of the busiest days to go to Disneyland - Saturday over the December holidays - we arrived at about 10am and it was already incredibly busy. The fast pass tickets for rides we coming in with return times for late afternoon / evening! The standby times on rides we at 90mins minimum and some up to 130mins.

I felt terrible for my kids as I knew they would not get on many rides and would become impatient in the queues.

By the end of he day we had gone on 2 rides and 1 simulator. We had to queue for everything - food lines, restaurants, popcorn, EVERYTHING was a wait.

It is by far the worst experience at a theme park I have had. There was clearly too many people there than they could accommodate.

If you are going for the rides, don‚Äôt bother. If you are going for the Disney experience then the place is clean and well maintained and the Disney characters roam the park for photo opportunities (but you have to queue for these too).

Disappointing for the kids.","Written December 31, 2018",1.0 of 5 bubbles

412,Enjoyable time despite the crowd,"People were not kidding when they mention that Disneyland Tokyo is very crowded. The queue is always long but if we use the Fast Pass, it is not an issue. We went Disneyland Tokyo for 1 day and it was sufficient for us to cover all rides. However, we could not catch the shows and the parade. Partly because we went back to our hotel to eat because there was no Halal food at Disneyland Tokyo. If we had not done that, we will be able to do more.

As usual, the crowd was overwhelming at the parade. As such, we prefer to queue up for rides. Although the queue for the rides was long, it was constantly moving and even when we waited for an hour for some of the rides, the wait was surprisingly pleasant. Especially since we went during the cool winter time and not during the hot and humid summer.

413,Over-crowded,"To start off, the subway station did not have clear instruction how to get there. We need to ask around, try to figure out which is the subway line and goggle for info. I am not sure why as this is a major attraction.

The attraction is filled with people on a cold winter day. Most attractions have to queue for at least from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. Standing in the freezing temperature is quite unbearable. So you can imagine how many rides one can take a day. It is over-crowded.

On a positive note, the staff made the rides interesting with their enthusiasm. The place has very high maintenance standard. This is clearly shown despite millions of people visiting it.

414,üéâ DREAMING UP! üéä,"Being a Disney Otaku, Tokyo Disneyland may be one of the best Disney Parks in Asia or in some case, one of the best Disney Parks in the world. I can't get over how tall and enchanting Cinderella's Castle is during the day or night. Before March 2019, it will be fantastic to visit Tokyo Disneyland as there is its 35th Happiest Celebration going on.

The decorations and constantly updated food menu, are splendid, especially World Bazaar Celebration Street. There is an enormous photo op for anyone to take pictures with all the mickey statues from all of the anniversaries up till the 35th. During the day, every 10 to 15 minutes, the theme song for the 35th anniversary will play. And at night, classic disney musical films from the Disney Renaissance era, such as the Lion King and the Little Mermaid will be played beautifully throughout World Bazaar.

One tip is if you target the popular rides, really do grab fastpasses at the fastpass machines near each fastpass attraction. For us, we grabbed the Monsters Inc Ride fastpasses at Tomorrowland and ran to Fantasyland to standby the ride for Pooh's Hunny Hunt. The fastpass would save you queuing time and it was worth for the Monsters Inc Ride.

Something that was spectacular was the limited-time only 'Dreaming Up' Parade. Waiting for about an hour to get a promising view of the parade was worth the time. You can rest and also purchase cute and detailed snacks from the famous Sweetheart Cafe at World Bazaar while waiting. I would recommend you to watch the parade before March 2019 and if you know or at least like Disney characters. The song was mixed beautifully with other Disney film music and the parade floats. It was so addictive that you can sing the song inside your head. For Disney fans out there, it may make you cry of nostalgia as I did.","Written December 29, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We went on a Sun and the crowd wasn't as crazy as what we had thought. Crowds are mostly locals, surprising not many tourists on a Sun.
A place that makes dream comes true! A pity that we didn't have time to take photo with any of the characters. Kind of sad thinking about it now. But we actually conquer quite a number of rides. The queue for the rides are quite manageable.

All I could say was one day here is definitely not enough. Try to plan ahead by getting the fast pass to some of the rides as well as the lottery chance for the performance. F&B queue are definitely long and so we had to settle on something quick like a Mickey hand-shaped bun / giant turkey drumstick / snacking on popcorn from the Willy design bucket. Best ride which I enjoyed was definitely the roller coaster one.

We found it amazing from the moment we walked through the entrance gates. I‚Äôve read some reviews about complaints re: wait time for attractions... it‚Äôs Disneyland! You are going to need to wait, please don‚Äôt be surprised. My partner and I waited from 20-110minutes (most wait times about 30-45). Every attraction has a sign with expected wait time so you are pre warned. We did not ever have a wait time longer then what was on the sign, in fact most of them were quicker.
Our most favourite attractions: Winnie The Poo, Thunder Mountain and It‚Äôs a Small World.
There is food everywhere! We went to the Queen Of Hearts Banquet. You get a choice of what you put on your tray (Savoury and sweet) some of the sweets come with a cup and saucer to keep! It was very well priced as well.
We spent from 9:30am-9pm there, make sure you stay for the fireworks (8:30pm) and try and watch a parade (usually after dark), you will see people sitting down waiting.
Truly an amazing place and a must see!

We only did one day and that was enough for us (we are incredibly officiant with time and do not like sitting down too long, so if you want to relax through your time there maybe do more than one day).","Written December 29, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

In Japan there are two parks side by side: Tokyo Disney and Tokyo DisneySea!

Disney is divided into 7 worlds or theme lands.
It goes from the western / western old style to the extreme future with Star Wars.

Lines in most rides are very long (60-90 min wait time) so Fast Pass and Single Rider are your best friends, make sure to make good use of them so you can enjoy all the rides in the park.

Thunder Mountain Railroad is way better than Disneyland Hollywood. It's my favorite Disney ride ever and the one in Tokyo is at par with Hong Kong's, in my opinion. Classic rides such as Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan, It's A Small World are a must. You can ride Jungle Cruise at night for a different feel. Star Tours have zero line so ride it anytime.

424,MAGICAL,"After our very long day at Disneysea, we headed to Tokyo Disneyland the very next morning at 8am. And long lines were already formed when we arrived! We thought we arrived early but no! So we managed to enter the park at 8.30am.

Went to get the first fastpass- Monsters ride before heading to the Star Tours (5 min wait). Then we went to Toontown for Gadget's Go Coaster (15 mins wait) and waited for 55 mins for a picture with Mickey. Seems stupid for the long wait but I'm so happy to be able to get a photo with him.

Then, we headed to Fantasyland for It's A Small World (20 mins wait)- still my favourite after visiting HK's Small World in Disneyland. I went to check the waiting times for the rides through the app and noticed Small World's waiting time was rather short so i dont think there's no need to get the fast pass for Small World. Go get fast pass for Space/Splash mountain or Big Thunder Mountain.

Food was rather average or downright bad. Luckily we ate at 11am/11.30am- when we went out alot of people were waiting outside! Gosh! (and we also had difficulties finding an empty table)

Took a stroll around Westernland next and went for Country Bear Theater but I almost fell asleep because I couldn't understand their language and what are they talking about- same goes to Disneysea but at least I understand the plot and songs) and all staff spoke in Japanese. I think English is also required because not only Japanese visit Disneyland- people from all over the world visit too. It would be best if they provide English Language as well.

Managed to get a fast pass for Space Mountain and we went for the ride. I like how they had exits for those who decided not to ride the ride. Space Mountain was thrilling and fun.

You can't miss Dreaming Up (parade) there because all your favourite characters will be appearing, transporting you back to your childhood dreams and memories. I really love the parade and I hope you all will too. We rode the Monsters Ride after that.

We queued for around 45 mins for the Pooh Hunny Hunt- amazing trackless ride and it spins and turns- so fun! We headed to Mickey's PhilarMagic afterwards before watching the fantabulous Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland for Disney's 35th Anniversary and WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS how amazing it was. It was though magic just happened in front of your eyes. you MUST watch this spectacular performance during this limited period of time. After the performance, we went in souvenir shops and bought more things than in Disneysea (oops!)

Wanted to catch the Brand New Dream fireworks at 8.30pm thus we went out to Ikspiari for dinner (there is a very big Disney store!) before going back to Disneyland for a 4 min fireworks that start punctualy at 8.30pm. After a very long day at Disneyland, we bid goodbye and left reluctantly..

The thing was our first one at 10:55 gave us a time slot at 18:55 and we couldn‚Äôt go fast track on another ride until 12:55 and all the rides had really long queues...even the food places.

If you are staying few days in Tokyo, I suggest to check the weather forecast once you arrived and decide the nicest day to go to Disneyland (It was raining the whole day when we arrived at Tokyo Bay where we stayed, got so lucky the next day was dry despite cloudy).

Make sure you browse in advance the map and tips & tricks for Disneyland/ Disneysea. Pre-arrange who will do the fastpass hunting as it will totally help the kids (and yourself) to be able to enjoy the park at most.

Tips:
I literary do the sprint run along bunch of Japanese teenagers once the gate is open (dont forget to bring all the tickets as you need to scan the ticket to get the Fastpass). While you do the hunting, kids and your partner can just stroll nicely to the toontown (minor queus perfect for the young toddlers).

The fastpass machine tickets are located at each areas (you can browse further about this).

I ran to Tomorrowland and got the 1st FP for the Space Mountain. Check your FP timeline and remember the window time (at the bottom you can see when you are allowed to get another FP).

*The most popular queue on our visit was the Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt. By 12am the FP machine was already closed and the normal queu was enormous. So, if you really want to ride this one, you might want to run first to Fantasyland to get the FP.

I got in total 6x FP (2x Space Mountain, 2x Buzzlightyear, 2x Splash Mountain, 1x Star Tours).

*Star Tours queue was not so bad around 5pm so might keep this ride for the latest.

*Don‚Äôt miss the fireworks and lights show on the closing time!","Written December 24, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

This early entry allowed us to get Fastpasses and que for rides well before the huge crowds entered the parks. It was also a great time to get your photos without people in the way. Do your research before you go on how the parks work and what rides are the most popular. Overall we enjoyed the parks just as much as Anaheim and Disney World.

436,The happiest place on earth,"To skip the line on the entry gate, its highly recomended for you to purchase the ticket in advance. And make sure to keep the ticket since you will need that to get the FASTPASS.

First, once you enter the park, just go directly to the Fastpass machine as soon as possible to get the ticket for the favourite rides. after you collect the Fastpass ticket, then you can enjoy the other rides that do not provide the Fastpass ticket.
This is how you skip the waiting line and enjoy the park as much as possible.

If you do not into some parades, just skip it as well, since it will takes about 1 hour (or more) for you to wait and keep the seat on the street. You really need to manage your time well spent to maximize all the rides in Tokyo Disneyland. Considering that in the regular time (weekdays and not peak season) the park itself can be very very crowded.

Do some research before visit the park, you can browse the Tokyo Disneyland official website to choose which rides that you wish to play include the park maps.

We arrived at the park at 0825 on a Tuesday and already lines were lengthening for the 0900 opening. We already had our entrance tickets so it didn't take too long to enter the park once that gates opened.
As advised we headed straight for the fast pass for the Pooh ride. At that time there was already a long line waiting to get a fast pass.
We got other fast passes during the day but unfortunately several clashed with the parades.
We ate at Tomorrowland dinner the foud was basic but reasonably priced. By being selective we were able to complete 15 rides in the day waiting no more than 20 minutes for any ride. We took in two parades the best being the evening Electric Parade which was spectacular. You need to claim a good seating spot at least an hour before the parade commences.

446,Simply Awesome.,"Went to Tokyo Disneyland in early June, and it was great. First and foremost, it's cheaper than the American Disneyland. For less than $70, you can have an amazing time. The park is actually on a larger tract of land than Anaheim, but there are a handful less rides- meaning the rides are spaced out nicely, and not congested.

The park was busy, but not that busy. We used Fast Pass on a lot, and I think the average wait time was about 15-20 minutes. One ride that was super popular was a crazy wait, like 3-4 hours, so we skipped it.

There are various Disney characters running around, so it was fun for my toddler to try and get a photo with them.

One other major comparison and observation was how reasonable food and drink is at Tokyo Disneyland. In the States, they get you for all you got when it comes to food and drink. In Tokyo, prices are no higher than they would be at any other store. Drinks are about the same as they would be at 711.

We went to a restaurant and I had a steak for $12. That would be unheard of in the States.

Tokyo Disneyland is super clean, and like just about everywhere else in Japan, super efficient, with impeccable customer service.

There are many things to do and ride even for a 2 year old. Of course the options will increase as the age does, but I am glad we went, as my daughter STILL talks about it and remembers how fun it was. So forget when people tell you that your kid won't remember anything.

I will start by saying if you are looking for an exact replica of the US Disney offerings you will be disappointed as there are some very unique differences. Those differences include Main Street USA is replaced by the Bizarre which still offers an array of great shops but it is different. Once you get past the Bizarre then it is more like the US offerings...... but spoken in Japanese. The park is super clean, cleaner than anything in the US and what really took our breath away was the quality of food. No you won‚Äôt find a turkey leg and there is a mix of US style foods and Japanese food but they are superbly done and of a high quality.

The other notable difference is the Japanese love for flavoured popcorn and popcorn buckets which they carry around like a fashion accessories. Chocolate, caramel, soy sauce and salt are just 3 of the some dozen or so flavours and the buckets we have seen included, Steamboat Willie, Olaf, Lightning McQueen, Stitch, Cinderella‚Äôs carriage, Chip and Dale, Mickey and Minnie‚Äôs bow.

Some of the attractions are better than the US Disneys too. The Haunted Mansion The Nightmare Before Christmas is much better either Disneyland or Disney World. The beginning of the Pirates of the Caribbean is better and Space Mountain is slightly different. There are some unique items to Tokyo Disney as well - the Pooh rise and the Monster‚Äôs inc ride are only at Tokyo.

But here is the issue. Many of the rides are spoken in Japanese. We know what is going on only because of our frequent visits to the US. It may be a deal breaker for many people though and having read some of the reviews here, I see many people struggled with this. Also the merchandise is different. There are not a lot of T-shirts and those they have are limited. Most of the merchandise is food related and we enjoyed this aspect but I know many won‚Äôt.

We loved this park and it was like discovering a Disney park all over again. It is very well organised and clean and as I said earlier the food is great.

We will be back and loved it.","Written December 4, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
449,A wonderful place for all ages,"We tried not to go there on weekends, so we chose to visit on a Monday. The queues for all the rides were still very long. Even though we didn‚Äôt manage to go on many rides or shows, we still enjoyed ourselves very much. Just being inside the theme park itself was already enough to make us happy. The atmosphere was wonderful. Oh and the shopping! We love Disney so we spent a lot on the merchandise - cookies, chocolates and souvenirs. Last but not least, we were so impressed with the staff. EVERYONE of them was friendly and looked happy. They were all so polite. The Japanese take pride in their jobs. They made our visit even more pleasant and memorable. I didn‚Äôt give it a full rating only because of the long queues for the rides.","Written December 2, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

451,Awesome Solo Trip,"Check crowd calendar to be sure you don‚Äôt buy tickets on crazy crowded days.

Everyone‚Äôs said it but it bears repeating: FASTPASS is your friend.
Get your game plan on and know which are your must-do rides. Get FP for 1st must-do ride, then queue for your 2nd must-do.
I‚Äôd advise you to familiarise yourself with the map prior to the trip so that you know exactly where your desired attractions are at which land.

Pro-tip: at ToonTown, go to the merchandise shop and you will see a vending machine that dispenses unique Mickey Mouse in baubles. 500yen a try. Guaranteed win and fun!

Also plan ahead which food items you want to have and know where they are- if you wing it, you might be too full when you chance upon another cutesy themed food item.

Wear comfortable shoes. I went alone so I had my power bank and Netflix shows downloaded for the queues. People watching is fun around the Parks cos they‚Äôre mostly dressed up but not in a queue where you see the same people. So unless you have good company, go prepared.

The toilets have those machines that play water sounds ... very Japanese.

453,"It‚Äôs Not The Best Park At Tokyo Disney Resort, But It‚Äôs Very Good","If you had one day at the Tokyo Disney Resort, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest going to this park. Instead I would recommend going to Disneysea instead, it‚Äôs a much better park. Having said that Tokyo Disneyland is a very good Disney park. 90% of the park is great and really fun. The 10% that doesn‚Äôt really work is Adventure Land.

Adventure land is a mishmash or random classic Disney attractions smashed together with a very vague theme. Many of the rides are fine, but how they connect to each other doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. The railroad, also found at Adventure Land, is one of the most disappointing trains in all of the castle parks. The main difference is that the train doesn‚Äôt stop anywhere else except the Adventure Land station. So while it‚Äôs a fun ride, it lacks the usability of the trains at other parks.

When we visited there was a lot of construction going on, but other than a huge wall connecting Toon Town (our favourite land) and Tomorrow Land it was fairly unobtrusive.","Written November 25, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
454,Perfect for Disney fans,"This Disney resort is fantastic for Disney fans of all ages! Cast Member service is truly excellent. Souvenirs are particularly well-made and worth buying compared to the offerings at Disneyland (Anaheim) and Disney World (Orlando). If you have young ones (especially little girls), I HIGHLY suggest the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall for lunch or dinner. It is truly a must-see dining experience with an option to purchase unique collectible stoneware. Restroom facilities are immaculately clean throughout the park. Also be on the lookout for unique collectible popcorn buckets throughout the various flavored popcorn stations. Also, the Pooh's Hunny Hunt trackless ride is absolutely phenomenal and should not be missed.
Some glaring issues are:
1. Japan doesn't have an ADA compliance equivalency, so wheelchairs and strollers may have a difficult time navigating some areas.
2. The painted concrete ""cobblestone"" areas are ridiculously hard, uncomfortable, and aesthetically ugly. Disney should have paid for either real cobblestone or smooth concrete.","Written November 25, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Pooh's Honey Hunt was a very nice and different ride and is very popular. The lines to get into this park are also very long at park opening! The stores are also very busy, particularly at night making it hard to get around. The Haunted Mansion seems very similar to the one in Florida but at the time I went it was decked out for the holidays with Nightmare Before Christmas, this arrangement was very unique and enjoyable! The castle projection show was also very nice.","Written November 19, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Even going to the toilet (for guys ) need to queue ?

I am being honest to share with all of you, unless you have too much free time and nothing better to do, please do not come to Tokyo Disneyland.

Hongkong Disneyland in my opinion is a must better option in term of efficiency.

The management have the cheek to tell me that everyone is queuing and waited for hours for a ride. My reply would be, why does everyone accept poor services make it right?

My husband decided to go to the lost and found, hoping that someone would have been so kind to return it.

The customer service was extremely nice. Other people would have laughed at an adult looking for a lost teddy bear; instead they took our claim seriously and requested a much details as possible.

464,Worth the trip!,"As a Disney fan, we couldn't pass up a trip to Tokyo Disney. Yes, it is different than what American's are used to, but it does have the Disney magic, with just enough familiar to blend with the new. Living overseas for a year, we just couldn't miss an opportunity to visit another Disney park. We enjoyed our time here at DisneyLand. It is crowded, but just know where you want to go and what you want to do and be prepared to wait in a line or two. Just let go, have fun and enjoy. I really only have 3 complaints:
1) the rides are tiny; built for the smaller Asian community. My family is tall so there were a few rides we were all smashed in to. My husband was almost denied entrance to ride space mountain. We have no issues in the states, but there was very little wiggle room on this ride and splash mountain. No room for long legs at all. Monsters Inc was also a tight fit; a really tight fit!
2) Fast passes. You can only get fast passes at the ride you want to fast pass, so people enter the park and go directly to the ride they want to fast pass, then you have to wait to use it. You can get your second one at the same time you can use your first one, so you are off to that ride to grab the pass then back to use the first one. They need to make it so you can get a fast pass for any ride at kiosks instead of having to go all over the park to specific rides. Much easier in the states.
3) Park entrance tickets are not so easy to get. You cannot order them from outside Japan as the resort does not accept credit card orders outside of Japan. You can purchase open date tickets from 3rd parties, but you are NOT guaranteed entrance to the park. During peak times, they may deny entrance if the park is crowded. These wont have dates on them. If you are staying at a Disney hotel you can get dated tickets at the front desk. Otherwise you'll have to wait in line at the park to purchase tickets.
Even with the few exceptions, we really enjoyed our time in the park. There are many of the familiar DisneyLand rides. It was Halloween time, so the park was decorated nice. The majority of people visiting were all dressed up so it was fun to people watch. We enjoyed the Spooky Boo Parade. I like how you have to sit along the parade route a few rows deep so many can view it along the route. You are also not allowed to have kids on your shoulders. The Electric Light Parade was amazing and the best I've seen at any park. It's always best to stick around for the light show on the castle and the fireworks. As Disney fans we were not disappointed with our visit.
Ask if you have any specific questions. If you are in Tokyo and you can make time, visit the parks. It is worth it. DisneySea is amazing as well.","Written November 14, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles
465,Tokyo Disneyland,"While planning to visit Disneyland , its better to Pre book the tickets to avoid long queues we reached at 10 , which is considered late since the park opens at 8 Am and it was already packed by the time we reached .

Its better to get your fast pass earlier on or else the wait on a crowded day is around 120 mins for the good rides also its better to avoid the week end , beter visit during the weekdays if possible.

Since we visited in October which was close to Halloween the People were dresse dup as their favourite characters , there are shops that provide the dress hair and make up for extra charge.

Not to be missed the fireworks in the evening and the Parades all are good .
Splash Mountain not to be missed .

Since you can get only 4 fast passe choose wisely.

We however spent all day but it was not possible to cover the whole park as there is so much to see.

the gift shops are expensive

For food there are separate Kiosks selling only certain items , like one would sell only BLT coffee etc

Be prepared to walk a lot and it going to be a long day

Tip 1: Always check the crowd calendar to choose the best date for your visit.

Tip 2: Go on a weekday. We went on a Friday and the lines were manageable.

Tip 3: Maximize your fast passes. First thing to do after park entry is get your first fast pass. Don't go on a ride yet. Efficiency is a must for this park. Same advice for your next fast passes - if it's already time for your next fastpass, get it first before doing anything else.

Tip 4: Do Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars while waiting for your fastpass rides. The lines here are short and quick but the attractions are more than decent. They're fun. Don't let the lines or lack thereof fool you.

Tip 5: Wear something weird or cute for a more fun experience. You won't stand out.

Tip 5: Skip Philharmagic. It was a bit of a drag.

Tip 6: If you want to try the famous Disney popcorn and not particular as to flavor, get the soy-flavored ones outside Star Wars. I never saw a queue there. It actually was very good but, of course, the caramel-flavored ones were so much better.

Tip 7: If you run out of fastpasses, go on the standby queues during parade hours. Most people would be watching the parade then.

Tip 8: Find a good spot for the night parade at least an hour before.","Written November 6, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Pro tip for rides, grab the fast pass for the popular rides like Winnie the Pooh first thing you enter.

But if you are visiting during school holidays when teenagers are the bulk...

The opening time on the Disney website said 09.00 but on our arrival at 08.00 the gates were already open. As I had already bought our tickets from the Tokyo Disney resort ticket center at the Ikspiari shopping mall on our first night, we walked straight in without any queues. Couldn't believe what was happening as many people were just sitting down to get a front row seat on the parade route. We headed straight for Big thunder mountain ride where there was only a 15 minute queue. On exiting the ride two of us walked to splash mountain to get 5 fast passes for our family. The time on the ticket was 11.30 - 12.30 so we did a show & 3 rides before returning, The enchanted tiki room stitch presents, western river railroad, jungle cruise & pirates of the Caribbean. With our fast passes in hand the queue for splash mountain was less than 10 mins. After the ride it was time to eat so while 3 stood in line at Grandma Sarah's kitchen 2 of us went to get fast passes for Haunted mansion. After lunch we had a bit of time before we could use our fastpasses so we took a ride on the Mark Twain riverboat then it was time for Haunted mansion. We walked to the Peter Pan's flight ride after but there was a 40 minute queue so we decided to give it a miss. From there we walked through the castle to Tomorrowland hall to try our luck on the show lottery. 3.55 Spooky ""Boo!"" Parade & 6.20 one man's Dream but no luck. We walked back to the centre of the park & Sat down to have a rest & eat the snacks we had brought with us into the park. The Spooky ""Boo!"" Parade passed by but we were to far away to see much. After the parade had finished we went back to Tomorrowland & took a ride on the Star tours ride as there was only a 10 minute queue. We had dinner at Plasma Ray's Diner. The light parade was at 7.30 so we had 1 1/2 hours to kill so my wife & one son went shopping in the World Bazaar whilst me & my other two sons went to the Monsters Inc ride, there was a 50 minute standby queue as we didn't have fastpasses but we decided to wait in line. When we arrived for the Electrical parade there were rows of people 12 deep. My wife & son's Sat down behind but as I cannot sit on the floor I just lent against a railing. After a few minutes a member of staff came & told me I must sit, but after I had explained to him I could not sit he said follow me (my family as well) wow, we ended up with a front row seat.

We got another excellent viewing location with a seat. Amazing show, what a finale to a super day. We left the park after the show & caught the bus back to Kasai from bus stop 9.
Looking back on my review I cannot believe how much we packed into a day, fastpasses are a must if you don't like standing in queues, Fast pass (¬•0). Your bags are checked when you enter the park but we took lots of snacks without any problem. Thanks Disney for a magical day! Happy Halloween üéÉ","Written October 25, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Minimum of 40 minutes to get food (sometimes the line would circle around the stall). Average of 60 minutes for a ride/exhibition. We didn't attempt to line-up for the most popular ones. My friend and I are not massive Disney fans so we would not recommend this to our friends - it's a waste of time if only in Japan a short time. For Disney fans I would recommend buying a fast pass to skip most of the queue, entering after midday or getting a multiday ticket.","Written October 24, 2018",2.0 of 5 bubbles

If you are like the speed and height that push your adrenalins, start from the 'Tomorrow land' on right side.. if you wanna take it slow, start from your left side.. beware of huge queue.. you have to line at least 30 minutes or more for major attraction. There are short cut with 'fast pass' but with additional charge (well... advantage come with price folks..). There are parades.. the day and night parade.. its magic for cameras..and many souvenirs shops that would magically drain your wallet with their cute things üòÅüòÅ. Its open on 8 AM and close at 10PM. My suggestion: come as early as possible, not weekend preferably. Bring your drink and food as there are many comfortable bench or chair around.

498,The familiar magic of Disney combined with Japanese efficiency!,"If you‚Äôve been to any of the other Disney parks around the world, you‚Äôll have a good idea of what to expect from Tokyo Disneyland: Fun attractions for all the family and incredible theming.

Tokyo Disneyland offers all of this and then some, combining the beloved attractions with very effective management to help you make the most out of your day. Staff are very friendly and helpful with getting guests on and off of rides as quickly as possible, which helps to minimise the wait times as much as possible.

The wait times are still an issue though and even on the less busy days, you‚Äôll want to go into the park with a strategy for how to beat the queues. The most popular rides seemed to be Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt and Splash Mountain, so I would definitely prioritise getting fast passes for these rides as early in the day as you can.","Written October 17, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We had an amazing day, the staff are super friendly and more than happy to help - shout out to the cast member that got an amazing photo of me and my friends in front of the castle because she knew the perfect spot to get a good angle.

Queues for rides were quite long at times but this was expected. Worth it just for the parades to be honest, we saw the Halloween one and the Light Parade in the evening followed by the fireworks.

503,Maybe the best Disney,"Tokyo Disney is our fifth (Anaheim, Orlando, Paris, and Hong Kong), and in many ways it was the best. All the Disney magic, but with the cleanliness, orderliness and politeness of Japan. We went on a day that was a little crowded (but not enormously so), and were never jostled, hustled, or had our view cut-off. People universally queue up, and sit-down to watch the parades and shows. We loved that so many patrons came in costumes, and there was a real embrace of the Disney merchandise. There a few unique rides, a few updates of old favorites, and an overall design flair that wonderful, welcome and undeniable. It is, however, a Japanese park, in Japan, that caters to Japanese guests, so just embrace the different foods and the fact that the ride narrations are in Japanese. Everyone was very (very!) helpful, however, and we found maps and guides in English and were able to eat, makes purchases and use the ATM just fine.","Written October 15, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
504,Best Disneyland so far,"I have seen now 3 Disneyland (Florida, Paris, Tokyo) and I am stunned to be amazed again. This Disneyland is well worth a visit, minimum 1 whole day. It is very entertaining, lots of fun rides for every age group.
Get your Fast Track tickets quick, they get out fast. Fast Track tickets cannot be bought in advance but need to be collected at Fast Track machines close to the rides. Waiting time my go up to several hours, so get them in time.","Written October 15, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
505,Its Disney at its Best,"I am a huge Disney fan. I have been to the US parks many times and I was unsure what to expect. We bought our tickets ahead of time. We went during the week on a Tuesday when school had started. It was not a holiday for Japan either. The crowd was nothing like I had been preparing for. It was light in comparison to the States. The most we had to wait for any ride was maybe 20/30 minutes at most. We did our fast passes too as often as we could.
The park and the restrooms were clean as I have come to expect Disney parks to be. And there were plenty of restrooms and stalls.
The food and snacks definitely have a Japanese twist to them...Not all of them. Nearly all the places have the menus posted outside. Popcorn is a huge snack here and it comes in several different flavors. A large is also about 23.00 us dollars. However you do get your pick of cool popcorn containers in the shape of many characters.
The cast members I had encounters with were helpful. I tended to ask if they spoke English before I just started asking my question. They were helpful and if they spoke no English there was someone that they could point to that did. Several of the rides we did were all in Japanese but for me that was ok. You still got what was going on.
The BIGGEST I can recommend is making sure to by your treasures as you go. If you see something in one place do not expect to find it in other places. The apps for the park do not work with US phones so there is no using the shop parks app to find or buy things. There is no online shop either. The Disney stores with the exception of the one located by the parks do not carry park items. So buy as you go.
The prices are very fair and most cases are same or cheaper than the US parks.

If you really want to do it up like the Japanese, come in costume (yes even the adults) or dress your group in matching outfits. The parades are great and everyone sits respectfully on the ground, so there's no jostling for a better view.

507,Changed my view on Disneyland,"I went to Disneyland in California previously and I hated the experience so much, I vowed never to go to another Disneyland again. But I had to break that promise for the sake of my kids, aged 8 and 9 when we went to Tokyo.

The place is an easy hour train ride from Tokyo and we went there on a Tuesday which I understand is one of the less busier days. There were still massive crowds but we probably only waited an average of 30 mins for the rides, including the fast pass. We went on about 10 rides in a space of 12 hours which I thought was pretty good. Everything was in Japanese so we didn‚Äôt really understand what was happening, especially when we went to Haunted Mansion and Star Tours but it was still good overall.

There is a massive selection of food at the place but I would bypass Grandma Sara‚Äôs Kitchen next time. The burgers at Tomorrowland Terrace were better and cheaper. We also tried the Mickey waffles which we could smell from a mile away and were absolutely divine.

We stayed back for the parade and the fireworks and I can understand why people say Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth. Despite the crowds, everyone was in good spirits and would often wave at each other. I loved the experience here, and hope to come back again and even check out Disney Sea.","Written October 13, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
508,Not sure how I would rate this,"We spent 5 days in Disney California and to be honest could have spent more !!!

Disney Tokyo not sure how I feel ... I was careful to book as per their calendar and book a light day but when we arrived ( early) there was literally thousands of people and I mean thousands ... not sure they stop selling tickets ... we moved with the flood of people and it was difficult to really look at anything in the main area.

We spent up to an hour in line for each ride ( remember this was marked as a quiet day) and the kids felt the rides were all the same . Everything is in Japanese does not really cater for foreigners but was an experience.

I am such a fan of Disney so I loved the experience but would of been concerned if it was a super hot day as no cover at all.

As a ride fan family I would call it a soft park ... my kids prefer the adventure park experience and for what it cost us to do one day in a Tokyo we paid for 5 in the USA.

No one ‚Äúcuts‚Äù the line here. The staff here were also very friendly and were all smiles.

Food was decent. We liked the pizza. The popcorn was good too. My 6 year old really wanted the plastic popcorn container of various Disney Characters that everyone had but at 2200 it was a bit pricey. The gift stores were unique with tons of Disney merchandise.

They had the Disney Halloween parade which was very nice. The park overall was a little more crowded that the Sea park, but everything was done in an orderly fashion Japanese style, and that made it nice. We didn‚Äôt really do too many rides because it was pretty crowded, but the ones we did we did with a fast pass. We wanted to go see Mickey and Minnie but the wait was a little too long for our toddler (2 yrs old) . We saw Minnie at Sea-park with only a 35 minute wait. I would go back without a toddler.

The planning was rewarded - we were able to secure fast passes and go on most of the Fantasy Land rides (which always take forever) by 11 AM.

Compared to other parks (we've been fortunate to visit multiple other Disney locations) this was the most tired and to me, felt like a lesser, smaller version of California. I note they are planning on building a new section and are also upgrading some areas. HK by comparison had a different vibe (granted Disney Sea is totally different but I am referring to Disneyland) with, in my opinion, much better food than here.

Even for a bottle of water you have to wait long time in line.
Overall we had one small ride, and because we are super tired of waiting and walking in this overcrowded park, we decided to leave and lose the costly ticket value.

We did not get a fast pass and the only tie. That was frustrating was on the Monsters Inc ride, which we waited for for 45 minutes before we left the line due to them letting ONLY fast pass entry.

Now being in my mid-forties, never did I thought I would be coming back. Dreading the long queues and exorbitant prices, honestly, I was not looking forward to this visit; however, my wife wanted to experience it. No need upsetting ones wife.

Now that I have visited the park, I have to say, I enjoyed it thoroughly. A day prior to the end of the summer holidays and residual wind from a massive typhoon, the park was not too busy. Average wait time for a popular ride was approximately 35 minutes (versus 150 minutes). Not too bad I say. My assistant who is a Disney fan informed me after the fact that days after a typhoon for generally quiet. The rides were all I. Japanese but this did not lower the hype (after all you are in Japan). The Haunted Mansion was decked out with a Halloween motif which added a nice touch. Food was slightly on the steep end but was not so bad. My wife and I were quite excited with the cute popcorn buckets (at my age that is a miracle). Disney magic basically shot my heart back into my youth.

546,Be Prepared Or Just Skip It,"Wasted day, though it was our fault. We should have been more prepared for the lines - yes, they are as long as people say. This park gets almost as many visitors as Orlando + Anaheim combined, while I believe it's about the same size. We made the mistake of going somewhat spur of the moment, without an advance plan for Fast Pass. I wouldn't recommend doing that, every attraction had lines of 80+ minutes. (One tip, at Splash Mountain you can ride as singles - we told them that at the Fast Pass line and they let us walk through - basically skipping the whole line). Otherwise, though, you're waiting well over an hour for what is usually a 5-minute ride.

Separate from the lines, I thought Pooh's Honey Hunt was one of the more creative rides we'd been on. Food options in the park weren't very impressive.

Vegetarians will have a tough time finding food - we only saw 2 places (1 counter service and 1 sit down) that had vegetarian options other than just french fries or a very plain lettuce salad. Food was mostly reasonably priced.

We had to wait almost 40 minutes to get our ""lottery seats"" because no one could help us since they didn't speak English. I have to say that staff were kind and tried to help us by using a translator app (but it was pretty bad and the words did not make sense).At the end, one boy with a fluent English could help us and solve the problem in 2 minutes.
We had the same problem in both parks when you asked for some info. Moreover, it was a quite disappointing to loose part of the attractions (such as videos, intros...)because they were only in japanese...it could be a good idea to mix both Japanese and English (we only had subtitles in Minions attraction) Moreover, the duration of the attractions is so so so short.
In other hand, I have to say that both parks were soooo clean. Amazing job and kind staff but these are two of the most important parks in the world and from our opinion, English should be taken into account since they receive people from all over the world.","Written August 7, 2018",3.0 of 5 bubbles

561,First time in the magic kingdom,"This is my first time in a Disney's park and I was having fun in every step.

From the ticket gate we went to train station to ride Disney's train. It's a short ride but we love it.

Entering the Disneyland park we were thrill with every aspect. There're bag check before entering (empty bottles and empty Disney's popcorn container are welcome). Disney's officers are so nice even we then check bags.

We straight walked to the ticket check and went to first fast past booth...Monster.Inc üòä

We went on Wednesday in summer so it wasn't as crowded as weekend.

Disney's parade are magical. For parade schedules and routes you have to get Disney's map at Ticket check gate. They have almost all language for map.

We had our lunch at 11.00 am so the restaurant was not crowded. The food is also good.

There are a lot of cold water dispenser station (inside a restaurant) so you can always fill your tumbler at any time. Bottled drink vending machine are available but their price is higher than outside vending machine, so it's better to bring your tumbler and refill to safe money for snacks and souvenirs.

The rides were magical, clean, with moderate que.

Souvenirs shops are everywhere but different zone can have different products so be sure to check out every souvenir shops if you search for a special theme.

Steam boat ride are definitely a must try to relax your feet after running around the park.","Written August 4, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

I was really teary eyed while watching the disney parade seeing Mickey Kouse and Minnie Mouse dancing gracefully with other disney characters . I tried the Space Mountain and it was great . I guess you need to stay for 2 days to enjoy the park or better to get a Fast Pass to manage your time to try all the rides. There was also a parade at night and make sure to see it.

563,Another great day out at Tokyo Disneyland,"I‚Äôve been going to Tokyo Disneyland since I was a little girl and have come back with my own kids over the years. Still a great place to visit!

Some tips for visiting Tokyo Disneyland in summer;

- If possible, visit before kids break up for the summer (about the third week of July), avoid the public holidays and choose a weekday. The forecast for how busy place may be can be found online.

- Buy tickets in a convenient store in advance. We purchased ours in Family Mart a couple of days before. You can buy them the day before and that would save you queuing for tickets on the day.

- Get there early!

- Buses are frequent and handy. We travelled from Yokohama by bus and it took us right up to the entrance and fare was very reasonable.

- Officially you are not allowed to take in any food or drinks of your own food within the park, but flasks for cold drinks would be ok and handy in the park especially if visiting in summer. Get your kids to carry one each across their shoulder to keep them hydrated and avoid heat stroke in the sun!

- Use fastpass to your advantage! They go very quickly, most places go early on and once they run out there will be no fastpasses. Remember that some attractions turn over is quicker than others, for example, Star Tours, It‚Äôs A Small Word etc have large capacity for a each ride so the que move quickly so no need for the pass.

- People tend to watch parades so ques are not as long for those times.

Enjoy the magic kingdom!","Written August 2, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

I enjoy visiting because I have enough history and context with the US parks to look for the differences and enjoy some of the cultural nuances of the Japanese park compared to Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. The most recent visit was the first time I took my kids, and I noticed the same from them. They enjoyed seeing the rides unique to Japan, and how other rides may have been tweaked from their US counterparts. The park is everything you'd expect from a Disney experience otherwise, and their unique seasonal celebrations are wonderful. We got to experience the Star Festival on this most recent trip, but their Halloween decor is also phenomenal. And they've really gone all out for the 35th Anniversary decor as well.

We both thoroughly enjoyed the park - there are lots of nice touches here you don‚Äôt get in Orlando or California - including some really tasty food options- be sure to try the different popcorn flavours!

The park is easily accessible from central Tokyo by train and we found prices on the gate to be very reasonable. The parade featured some nice Japanese cultural touches and we found the cast members to be really great - there is a lot of Disney magic here. Visitors to Orlando will find that Tokyo don‚Äôt do single rider lines - except for splash mountain. We wanted to ride Big Thunder Mountain but when we got there and asked about single rider, we were told they didn‚Äôt have the facility. At that point we did t have 90mins to wait to ride, so we headed towards the exit- the cast member followed us and stopped us and said she wanted to offer some pixie dust by giving us a fast pass so we could ride.

There is a world bazaar replacing main street. It is undercover which is great especially in the summer heat. There lands are organized differently but most of the rides from Anaheim are here. The only ride I would recommend getting a fast pass early is space mountain. This ride consistently had the longest lines (2hr+) from the summer crowd. There wasn't a ride in the park my son could not ride he is 105cm. The park has some really good eats. Try the waffle and fried chicken sandwich at the woodchuck lodge in westernland.

Being jet-lagged we skipped the morning and opted for the ¬´go on rides with shortest waiting-time tactic¬ª. It worked,and we managed to get 2 fastpasses even though it was 2pm and we took 10 rides. If you want to avoid lines for the restaurants,stay clear of eating between 12-13 and 18-19. On hot days choose afternoon/evening visit. Try the Star Wars dumplings, Mickey Waffels and the Queen of hearts/Alice in Wonderland buffet. Worth it!

Their Usatama parade is so catchy and fun, make sure to check it out. The food is delicious and their limited edition merchandise can't be beat. Fun Disney staples as well as Disneyland-exclusive rides. Make sure to ride Pooh's Hunny Hunt and the Monsters Inc ride, both are exclusive to TDR.

Fun tip, they have a lot of popcorn carts with awesome flavors, such as soy sauce-flavored popcorn.

If you can't speak Japanese, there is a lot of written English and they will give you an English map when you buy your ticket. Some of the staff may speak some English to you, but most will not. I do suggest you do some research before you go.","Written July 14, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Definitely utilize this system and the single rider lines if you can. It was a little odd that some of the rides/attractions were in English and some in Japanese. The staff was all friendly and helpful. I loved the flavored popcorn carts and found a few vegetarian options. The app isn't as efficient as apps for Disney parks in the United States, so if you are used to having that convenience you may want to plan a bit in advance. We were able to ride everything we wanted to in one day. Definitely a fun treat! My only suggestion is that they add more vegetarian food options. There were only a few in the park.","Written July 14, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Begin with - One man's Dream ‚Äì An Amazing show with many Favourite Disney Characters

On my most recent visit to Disneyland it rained consistently all day & was cold so we were in full ski gear jackets and pants so we could still get around the park and onto rides without carrying umbrellas & because of this the ride queues were quick the park was not full. At around 530pm we walked straight onto STAR TOURS & SPACE MOUNTAIN big ride attractions no waiting & which I have queued in Best weather conditions 2017 about 45-60mins THAT WAS AWESOME. These rides are ""OUT OF THIS WORLD"" Amazing!
All parades were cancelled. Obviously Dream lights - night time parade could not go ahead in rain. I did see it last year in 2017 & it is truly gobsmacking magical visual experience and a good time to take a rest- don‚Äôt miss it if weather permits. There are many vantage points though having the castle as the backdrop is essential for most. There are brand new daytime Parades ""Dreaming up"" & Sansui Summer Beat these are really fun highlights of the day.

This year it seemed there was a lot of works going on too. A large area was undergoing installation of new attractions. SPLASH MOUNTAIN & Haunted Castle was closed for maintenance. To avoid disappointment & in planning your visit - check website for attraction maintenance & closures. Check the weather radar too ‚Äúknow what's coming‚Äù weatherwise is a good idea too.
Our day just got wetter and wetter, the crowds did not endure and I found myself riding on many previously missed rides Buzz lightyear Astro blasters - Pirates of the Caribbean - Poohs honey hunt, was cute. Snow Whites Adventures the Western River railroad the Jungle cruise wildlife expeditions - We loved it all!

So there are advantages to perceived bad weather. Staying at a DISNEY Resort Hotel enabled us to return twice to our room, to change clothes, as the conditions changed - freshen up and return to the park. DISNEY Resort hotels have a Disney resort liner coach to transport you from the monorail to your hotel lobby so at no time were we left out in the rain and cold.
It's Fun Friendly & fresh atmosphere at Tokyo Bay Disneyland ‚Ä¶. everyone is happy! A really great place to be !

Rides were great, queues were long for those who couldn‚Äôt figure out or afford the fast pass system. Quite the money spinner for them! Parades were spectacular, especially the night one, but the fireworks were unfortunately cancelled due to the weather. Food prices were also quite acceptable. Understanding that this is based in Japan and probably 99% or more of the people were Japanese, it was frustrating that all the rides had no English spoken in them. Now I would have thought that these days that some sort of Bluetooth translation system would have been available for those rides that had spoken dialogue within it. But anyway.

Everyone genuinely seemed to enjoy the park and the magic and their job. It was truly magical! The main street is the most unique of all as it is covered and in the mornings they had a confetti party which my kids loved. Disney Sea was also a favorite as it is also very different from other Disney parks.

Loved all the unique apparel and items. Sizing is funky so if you're plus sized or taller you will have trouble finding a shirt/clothes that fit but for kids and average/small adults everything is very bright and unique!

The light show at 8.00pm was breathtaking. never seen anything else that comes close. The only thing that seems to be missing is the lack of characters that other parks seem to have on tap.

608,Not a Safe Place to Visit If You Have Allergies!!,"I hate writing this review because, in general, I have had amazing experiences with Disney worldwide. But an experience we had at the Tokyo Disneyland park really disappointed and disturbed me. I was traveling with my family and friends. We are a French/ American family. Our friends are a Japanese / French family. My Japanese friend had booked tickets and organized everything for our days at Tokyo Disney.

We knew, going in, that there was no real WiFi at the park. So we took the initiative to buy WiFi units. Despite this, our party ended up getting separated into 2 groups who couldn't find each other. At some point, my husband and I took our kids and my Japanese friend with us on a ride. Her 9-year-old son didn't want to go on the ride, so he stayed with my mother in law. When we came off the ride, my very responsible mother in law was nowhere to be found. As we didn't have the WiFi unit, we had no way to find them. Luckily, we had prearranged to meet at a particular restaurant.

When we got to the restaurant, we learned, to our horror, what happened. My friend's son had gotten hungry while waiting and so my mother in law got him a chocolate snack. This boy is allergic to peanuts, but nowhere on the packaging was it mentioned that the ice cream contained peanuts. Fortunately, my mother in law is a French pediatrician, realized he was having an allergic reaction and took him to the medical center.

Once at the medical center, there was NO ONE on staff who spoke English or French. Luckily, the boy could speak Japanese. When he told them what was happening, and that his Epipen was with his mother, they informed him that the didn't have any medicine there to give him for it. NOTHING FOR A PEANUT ALLERGY!!! He was told that they would have to go offsite to get something. Fortunately, his reaction wasn't as severe, and my mother in law got in touch with his father who was able to run offsite to get the pills. There was no doctor on site.

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE for DISNEY! We have been in the medical offices of several Disney's around the world. Hong Kong had an actual medical doctor on site. Walt Disney World has pretty much everything for all emergencies. So not having something as basic as an Epipen, or some form of Epinephrine is dangerous and negligent for an international amusement park, especially one with as stellar a brand as Disney.

I should also mention that I am celiac, and I had a very difficult time in Tokyo with finding things to eat. Wheat syrup is hidden in lots of things. The allergy menu's at Tokyo Disney basically said ""may or may not have"" for almost every entry and every allergen. It was like their legal department wrote the menu. I basically just ate food I brought as I was never able to be sure.

As the Olympics brings a larger than normal international crowd to Tokyo Disney in 2020, they will need to do better.

* For those those who are tsk tsking about us not having the medicine with us....we did. But we got separated, as is destined to happen at places like this.","Written July 3, 2018",2.0 of 5 bubbles

Kids travel free.

The park has several rides which are of interest to kids and adults. You can complete the park in a minimum of a day and maximum of 2 days.

Definitely go in a weekday is possible since the crowd is much less. We had a great time. On a Saturday or Sunday the lines get crazy. The waiting on weekends is at least an hour a ride. For people with a fast pass, please go early on a weekend to book your slot for the evening.

One time, this 1 person in front of me queing but needed to go to the restroom, and she asked the staff if she can go. What happen next was the staff stand holding all her bag in the que while she went to the restroom. The staff is happily doing this while chatting with other guest.

Can you imagine this in other Disney park?

This is what customer service is all about.

One thing that really bump us out is that Disney introduce this DUFFY characther that suppose to be Mickey‚Äôs teddy bear.

For Disney to introduce new characther is nothing new, but the eliminate almost all the merchandise (the main character) to focus on this new ones is silly.

Reminder: you can only have one fast pass assigned at any given time - so be sure to look at the schedule before you check out a fast pass ticket (you might pull a pm ticket and won‚Äôt be able to get any other fast lapses during the am)

‚Ä¢ budget for food and drinks. Most of the restaurants are expensive...but the experience is worth it!

‚Ä¢ Wear good shoes

‚Ä¢ if you‚Äôre doing a full day, break away for lunch. Use the Disney train to go to ikspiari mall and eat lunch there! It‚Äôs cheaper and there are more food options.

624,Too Crowded,"One experience we could have save ourselves during our Japan stay. Too crowded, space mountain closed, fast passes were already gone when we arrived at 9:30am and avg waiting time at the key rides exceeded 2 hrs. Not worth it. We should have better visited Fuji-Q highland park instead which has more exciting roller coasters and far less visitors.

Learnings from the day:

1) Be early:
We visited Disneyland with our three children 7, 11 and 14 years. While we went during the week and arrived at 9:30am the Fast passed were already gone. If you want a smooth experience be at the park at 8:00am sharp, head directly to the key attractions and collect your Fast Passes there at the vending machines. Fast passes are free and only valid and available for individual rides so plan your visit and key attractions you want to see in advance.

2) Great for younger kids. Take teenagers to Fuji-Q Highland unless they are into Disney:

I had been to EuroDisney a number of times in the past. The last time 10 years ago. While Disneyland Tokyo is comparable in size and rides my kids (11 and 14) prefer more faster rollercoasters. As space mountain was closed for maintenance Big Thunder Mountain did not really excite them and the waiting time for splash mountain was in excess of 2 hours.
The Haunted House was not scary as well. So most rides were great for my 7 year old while my teenagers were bored.

3) Popcorn:

Popcorn seems to be a highlight in the park. Watch out though. While there are many popcorn stations, each one sells a different flavor. The flavors and location of the stations are indicated on the map. Check the flavor before queuing for 15 minutes to get a bag of popcorn that is not the right flavor.

Overall the park is very clean, staff are the most friendliest staff in the world and it can be a great day out with if planned right and you are ok with crowds.

629,Full day of Disney fun and food,"Buy your ticket before arriving to avoid standing in line at the ticket window. The staff is very polite even during the bag search at the entrance. Get your Fast Passes at the popular rides first thing. The Honey Bear attraction seemed to be popular with the younger kids. Space Mountain wasn't in operation. There is the upbeat Disney music near the Main Street entrance and we even watched a small group of Disney performers in futuristic space costumes doing a singing and beatbox performance in the middle of the day. The shaved ice flavors seemed to vary according to where you are in the park. The matcha shaved ice was in Adventureland and it was a wonderful and refreshing snack to have during the hot day. It came with a dollop of sweet adzuki and an alien mochi dumpling on top. I had to ask an employee where the matcha flavor shaved ice was offered. The park does have other flavors of shaved ice like orange at other locations. Ask an employee because they have a map of where these can be found. The queues are long, but the system is very efficient. Star Tours was my favorite even if it was all in Japanese. Try to ride it more than once to see the different videos. There are employees helping senior citizens with canes and wheelchair guests enter and exit Star Tours through a different door. One female employee who helped the handicapped guests at Star Tours on June 8, Sato san, even took the time to speak to me (in Japanese) about my taking refuge under the tree to escape the heat while I ate my pizza. It's the small things that make Tokyo Disneyland special. I would suggest eating lunch an hour before or an hour after the major noon lunch crowd. It was difficult to get a table to sit down at during the peak lunch rush so people were eating outside and sitting on low walls or even sitting on the ground. In Tokyo Disneyland, people stood in line patiently, employees took pride in their jobs, and it was the most orderly crowd I have seen at an amusement park. It was fairly easy to get to on the subway. Like other Disneyland parks, the experience is fun for people of all ages. Remember to wear a hat and stay hydrated if it is a hot day because the queues can be very long and the sun can be harsh.","Written June 24, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
630,Disneyland Tokyo - probably the best Disneyland in the world,"A disclaimer first. I purchased a ""Enjoy Lots of Attractions"" Vacation Package. That gave me a few advantages like a number of Fast Pass ""A"" tickets (which I could use for all rides which allowed Fast Passes) and ""D"" tickets (which I could use for all Fast Pass rides except Nemo and Toy Story). I could use these Fast Passes at anytime. All this allowed me to cut down on the queuing time which made it a much more pleasant experience (the queues were incredible). The time savings alone really paid for itself. The ticket also allowed me to visit and go back and forth Disneyland and DisneySea - which allowed for maximum flexibility which I needed because of young kids in tow.

But there are other reasons why I think this is probably the best Disneyland (and I mean, both Disneyland and DisneySea Tokyo) in the world.

1. The Japanese Way of Doing things - polite, efficient, organised and clean. The toilets are incredibly clean even with the international crowds, and they generally don't smell. I am not sure how they manage to do that. And when it comes to watching the day and night parades, the first few rows of people viewing the parade will need to sit down so that the people standing behind willhave a relatively unobstructed view of the parade.

2. The Attention to Detail. When you walk through the park, try to take the time to look for the small details which have been built into the design. Photos, footprints, little knick-knacks placed here and there, and even the dry-wit in the posters and chalkboards. Take a look at some of the photos.

3. The Snacks and Drinks - the soft serve ice-cream (albeit a tad sweet compared to the usual Japanese soft serve ice-cream) and the different flavours of popcorn, the range of drinks available ranging from bubble tea (the tapioca mango drink at Squeezers), hot/iced chocolate to the ubiquitous oolong tea.

4. The kawaii-factor. If you need to find an excuse to wear that cute Disney ears, hat, matching t-shirts or whatever, then you will feel right at place in the park because a number of people were wearing them. It was also fortuitous that the park was celebrating the Tanabata Festival. Anyway, that meant that some Japanese visitors (adults and kids alike) to the park wore light and colourful kimonos called yukatas. Very kawaii.

There are some negatives though.

1. The Crowds. I visited the park on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and with the exception of a rainy day, the other days were crowded. This obviously meant that the queues were very very long (which is why the Fast Passes came in handy). I cannot imagine the crowds on a weekend.

2. Language. The shows are largely performed using the Japanese language. So unless you understand Japanese, the shows are largely for visual effects. It also makes it a wee bit difficult trying to communicate. Use your translation apps or convince a friend who speaks Japanese to come along with you.

But all in all, the positives largely outweighed the negatives, and my kids loved it.","Written June 24, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
631,Disney Magic and Japanese efficiency,"Tokyo Disneyland was similar to other Disney properties but smaller in size. Although most of the shows were in Japanese were a little English thrown in, we enjoyed them all. The park was very clean and the staff helpful.
We used a crowd predictor and were there with very light crowds. We used FastPasses and were pleased that the lines weren't too long for the other attractions. We were there for 12 hours and saw everything we wanted to see in the first 5 hours and so repeated our favorites and saw other things until the fireworks.
I had a great time there and would highly recommend it for anyone in the area.","Written June 22, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

633,What a crowd!,"We went to Tokyo Disneyland for a one day trip in June, on a Sunday noon. We expect to see a lot of crowd but we did not expect to see so much!

Traveling there is easy: Take the train to Maihama train station and just follow the path (or the crowd) to the Disneyland entrance. After a swift security bag check and entry payment, you can spend the rest of the entire day and night enjoying the theme parks. Well, you'll spend more time queuing for the rides, but I guess we expected that. Typical queue time for rides is around 130min, except for the ones which are not so interesting.

Overall, it's been good fun. But for impatient guys like me, looking at the queues is already mood-dampening enough.","Written June 20, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

641,Terrible in Comparison to DisneySea,"You can definitely see that the high ticket price goes into how well decorated the park is. There is a lot of style over substance here. I wouldn't bother unless you have little kids. Go to DisneySea instead.

The only ""thrilling"" ride is probably Splash Mountain. The rest of them are designed for VERY small children. I mean, like under 10. Space Mountain was okay, but ultimately just another children's ride. I was getting excited with all the signs telling me it was fast paced and thrilling, even designing escape routes for people who chicken out... but it was an overall meh.

This theme park has the castle, but DisneySea is miles better. I had never been to a Disney park before, but I can now confirm that they are grossly overhyped. If you have small children, it will certainly bring them lots of entertainment. For me, it was a dud.

Also to note: Very difficult to find vegetarian/vegan food here. Only 2 places offer a vegetarian OPTION and one of them is in the most expensive restaurants. Very sad to see a huge company like this not cater to everyone.

Tip: The fast passes are free. You get one every two hours. Go to the ride you want to go on the most as soon as you get there, and you will get given the next available fast pass time. I went for Tower of Terror (DisneySea) at 10am and our fast pass was not until 5pm.","Written June 16, 2018",2.0 of 5 bubbles

Space mountain has fabulous view of the various cartoon characters along the ride and although some of the signature rides for kids are closed during that period (Pooh‚Äôs hunny hunt and it‚Äôs a small world), we still think it‚Äôs quite worth while to visit. The queen of hearts banquet hall is a sight to behold! And the legendary various popcorn flavors with the quite expensive containers are sought after.

The main issue is I have to say the crowds, we went on a Tuesday during school time, where according to the local info it would be circa 50% capacity, it was however absolutely packed, I dread to think what it would have been on a peak day.

The other downside is the fast pass system is fully embraced here and it is quite normal for fast passes to be fully issued before lunchtime for some rides (kind of defeats the object in our view)

On the plus side the staff are very friendly and their are a couple of unique rides, catering is a little unique as well with some interesting choices

664,Happy 15 with a toddler - perfect day,"Our expectations of what we could achieve with a toddler (2.5 year old) were pretty low and I think that's a great way to approach the day.

Our goal was to ride the Winnie the Pooh Honey Hunt ride and the Monsters Inc ride without too much of a wait time, then make it back to the hotel for a nap before going back. We stayed at the Disney Ambassador hotel in order to get the Happy 15 (this is a free pass if you stay at certain luxury type resorts where you get access to the Park 15 - 30 minutes earlier than general public). This meant that we had a wait time of barely 5 minutes to get on the Honey Hunt ride (I don't think the ride actually opened until the general park opening but you can line up during the Happy 15). Once that was done we lined up for Monsters inc for around 15 minutes, so by 9am we had achieved the day's goal and everything else was a bonus!

Just one thing that should be completely obvious but might not be: all of the characters on all of the rides speak in Japanese and sing Japanese versions of songs (like the Tigger song which seemed familiar but not quite the same melody/cadence as the English version)... but they still have recognisable character voices, most of the storylines you don't really need to understand what is going on or enjoy the ride, and I'm pretty sure your toddler won't even notice. We explained how clever the characters were that they could speak Japanese as well as English because we were encouraging our toddler to say 'thank you' etc in Japanese while we were there.

We went before opening on Thursday in late May on an overcast (but not cold or rainy) day, which was perfect. The crowds were relatively low. We saw the crowds swell on the Friday/Saturday and afternoons and wait times got really long. I feel that you're better off going back to your hotel after the late morning parade to catch a nap and then heading back again after they wake up, early evening, if your toddler can make it to 8pm - 9pm the crowds thin out and the wait times go back to 5 - 20 minutes per ride.","Written June 4, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

That said at least as you sit down for the parade there is no pushing or shoving from people behind.

There is a severe lack of Disney princesses to have photos taken with as there is no princess pavilion.

There are nice opportunities at the entrance for photos with other characters and the merchandise stores seem cheaper than Paris or Orlando. The food selection is typical of what you would expect at a Disney park!

There is a nice area called toon town which young kids love. They can wonder in and out of the characters houses.

Cheaper tickets, lesser crowds and shorter lines made it more enjoyable than the Disneyland at home here in California. Rides like Pirates, Big Thunder and Star Tours operate similarly to the SoCal ones. Space Mountain stuck out because instead of the Cali sensory overload with the music blasting in your ears, Tokyo Space was quiet with just the sound of the track, making it more eerie like. Pretty cool. If I'm not mistaken, there's no Matterhorn which kind of bummed me out since it's one of my favorites. My other favorite -Indiana Jones- is in Tokyo DisneySea, which I unfortunately didn't have time for. In retrospect, had I researched better and wouldn't have been crunched for time, I probably would have opted for DisneySea since it seems more unique.

673,Good but needs to review its Fast Pass system,"Tokyo Disneyland was a pleasant experience considering this was my first ever visit to any Disneyland, although the rides are catered for the younger visitors but the atmosphere was great and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Japanese are all very accommodating and customer centric which made being there more enjoyable.

As mentioned, a lot of the rides are tailored for younger children and being a young coupon of 27 and 28 years old we didn't go on all the rides. The ones we did go were enjoyable and nothing that will scare even the faintest heart visitor.

The following are all highly recommended; Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster, Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain.

However my biggest complaint is that their Fast Pass system seems flawed due to it being offered for free and the passes being limited to time slots across the day, plus you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can obtain another Fast Pass for another attraction. As we visited during Golden Week, the park was heaving and a lot of the Fast Passes were already all allocated, plus the queue times were at about 1 hour 30 minutes long. So if you think you can pay a little more to ensure you've tried all the rides, this isn't possible because they don't offer such system. If you don't manage to get any Fast Passes then waiting times can be quite long.
If you plan to visit and want to maximise time then try to get as many Fast Passes... you may spend a lot of time wandering but it will be worth it. Take note of the cool down time between collecting the passes because you won‚Äôt be able to collect it all at once. This should definitely be looked at by management.
Aside from this issue, the park itself is worth a visit!","Written May 31, 2018",3.0 of 5 bubbles

We got to the park at 8:15 am on a Thursday in May. Throughout the day, there were only 2 rides that had 1-hour waits. Everything else was about 30 minutes maximum. Even when they tell you it's 30 minutes, it's more like 15 minutes.

Now this really annoyed me, barely any notice and there had been no rain for a while at this point and barely any wind yet at other Disney parks they still perform illuminations even in the rain.

680,Absolutely amazing,"I absolutely fell in love with Tokyo Disneyland. I found it much bigger than the one on Hong Kong and LA. It's very clean and easy to get around. There are many staff around to assist. Even though this is something small but I absolutely love the popcorn stands. You can buy a themed popcorn box and go to other stands to refill for 500yen. There are so many different flavours too. From garlic prawn, to black pepper to blueberry etc etc. The map also marks where the popcorn stands are and what flavour they are.

I think you need 2 days to finish the park if you don't want to rush and see everything. There are many shows around for kids too. I went there during their Easter/ 35year celebration, so they had afternoon parade and also the night light parade.
Get a good seat early. Maybe an hour before the show you should secure a good seating.

Love the shops in Disneyland though they are pricey. To me there wasn't much food options are also pricey. You can borrow a pushchair or wheelchair at Disneyland.

The map give you a lot of detail, where shops are, attractions, photo ops of the characters. Alice in Wonderland caf√© had specialty cakes during their 35year year celebration, which was great as we celebrated my godson's 5th birthday with a cake there.

The staff are very friendly, they all said happy birthday to my godson as he was wearing a birthday badge that I had brought. They gave out stickers for first visits, birthdays etc. Where as LA gave you an actual badge.

The tickets to Disneyland/ Disney sea were cute. You have to keep a hold of it if you buy consecutive day passes. I purchased a 4 day pass and the first 2 days you have to go to the park you chose and the 3rd and 4th day you can go either park. Unfortunately you have to use it consecutively, you can't have a break in the middle and continue. That's when it gets tiring.

There are some things for the little kids but more for big kids- or depending if you're little kids get scared easily or not. But my god son love the toy story attraction in Disney sea, the monster inc attraction in Disneyland, Small world attraction and he love the parades with all the characters. He got scared in the Nemo attraction and the submarine attraction in Disney sea ( which is has aliens under water)

Note:
* NEVER go on a weekend as the locals go there too so it's VERY crowded. there's no point lining up as its like 2-3hours per ride waiting time and also fast track lines are very long too.

*I think 3 days is enough for both parks you can go to Disneyland first day then Disney sea second day and go to which ever you like the best on the third day.","Written May 28, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

They weren‚Äôt exaggerating.
If you do decide to go, get there early and run around the main rides setting up your fast pass. You can scan your ticket at fast pass stations, which will then give you a set time to come back to the ride and skip the main queue.

The wait for many of the rides are long, as they don't have FastPass for Hauted Mansion, It's A Small World and Jungle Cruise. The wait times for Splash Mountain and Buzz Lightyear are crazy! However, unlike Shanghai Disneyland, people are relatively nice and wait their turn. However, just like Shanghai Disneyland, they charge for the FastPass which is just wrong in my opinion. The food here is odd, as the western food like the foot long hot is more Japanese flavour than western. The Japanese like the Chinese buy everything, but not t-shirts or pins to trade.

This is the only Disney theme park not owned by Disney and I guess that creates an indescribable spark and edge over the rest of Disney theme parks. Most of the rides are equal counterparts to their American versions but you'll immediately notice that the streets are wider, giving the theme park a bigger feel. You will also get to meet Disney characters seldom met elsewhere, like characters from Hunchback and Mermaid!

The rides and attractions are simply fantastic and you have got to dedicate 2 days to truly experience all of them, parades, rides, shows, shops. Be sure to spot the roving comedic cleaner!","Written May 16, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Pirates of the Caribbean was my favourite for the day, I had high blood pressure so the most thrilling attraction I did was Star Tours. Our longest wait was about 40-50 minutes for the Haunted Mansion and this was at peak time. The waiting goes quick with the distraction of your surroundings and if you have company. The staff knew little English in my experience and spoke Japanese on all rides unless there was an animatronic, not a complaint at all considering this is Japan, but something to point out for any foreigners wondering.

Easy to get to by Disney monorail /train.

Very limited English spoken in this park and all shows 90% of rides are in Japanese no English so it‚Äôs a shame for tourists as other parks like Hong Kong, Paris accommodate tourists. However this park has so many Japanese visit I doubt they need foreign tourists to make money anyway. Really aimed at the locals.

Priced like most Disney‚Äôs 3 day pass about $220 Australian each
1 day at Disneyland
1 day at DisneySea
3rd day can go between both

Fireworks were not as good as other Disney‚Äôs and are not over the castle like others not sure why.

Food pretty average and pricey mainly Japanese food few simple dishes around.

Rides were good
Well kept park

Seems locals avoid these parks when it is raining even a little rain, so a great time to go.

Good to go between Monday-Thursday avoid Fridays and weekends and really good weather as the crowds on these days are insane..

If you can stay after fireworks the parks empty quick and you can get on most rides easily between 8.30-10pm

Some rides no lines at all and fast passes are available at the rides in the park for allocated times. But popular ones go quick.
Longest line we saw was 60 minutes in the week.

Get into the souvenir shops and buy something for yourself. Reward yourself with something, can be anything to make yourself happy. For example, we got ourselves different hats (different character) to keep ourselves warm and blend in the disney atmosphere. Where else can we wear those hats other than in Disneyland.

We got there early to queue for entry and was already a long queue. But once opened, the queue was cleared fast and smoothly. Very organised and friendly.

734,Disney Magic - with crowds,"Tokyo Disneyland was the 4th Disney property i have been to. It feels as magical as the USA parks, and it very clean. It was however, VERY busy. I went in early April, on a tuesday, and the lines were at least 180 for the popular rides (splash mountain, big thunder mountain, pirates of the caribbean etc). I would recommend getting there for opening, as i got there at 8.10am and there were already lines to purchase tickets/get through the gates, and I would knock out all the popular rides you want to do first. The metro/train goes straight to the gates practically which is convenient. One thing that is huge at Japan that isn't as big in other places is Popcorn. Not only do they have 8 different flavours of popcorn, you can purchase AWESOME popcorn holders/buckets. These are themed and are sold in different areas, so don't buy the first one you see (they had cinderella, darth vadar, cars, Olaf and many more when i was there). These are so popular because once you purchase one, refills are much cheaper. Almost everyone i saw had one, some were older versions that weren't being sold when I was there! The lines for the popcorn can honestly be around 20 minutes also - but worth it. The food is super themed and amazing, and i would definitely recommend the mickey churros and the mickey glove buns. People line up/seat up for the parades quite early, so if this is something you want to see with perfect view, i would recommend getting a good spot about an hour earlier, or this is a good time to go on the popular rides if you don't mind. Unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled for me due to wind/weather issues. There are no ATMs in the park for foreign cards (e.g. Mastercard or Visa), so ensure you have enough cash. The big stores (like emporium) take these cards, but the little vendors don't. I love this park, and will definitely be back!","Written April 15, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
735,Amazing,"This place is a great place for everyone both children and adults. They have thought of everything, there are some many staff around it you need help finding something. There are rides appropriate for all ages. They had popcorn stalls everywhere and plenty of places to eat. We spent 2 days and got most things done, we did go in the middle of the week, which i think helped with the crowds and we also got tickets to get into the park 15 mins early which were awesome. I would deferentially recommend using the fast past stations, otherwise you will line up for hours just for one ride.","Written April 15, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Gates open at 8am I think and we got there at 7.30 and it was already crazy. Make sure you do your research of how to utilize the fast pass system. You need a fast pass to ride to the most popular rides, unless you want to wait 180 mins plus in line. Download an app that shows the wait times (it isnt the official Disney app, but search in app store). Food and toilet lines weren‚Äôt as bad the ride lines, and were actually not crazy expensive. Buy your tickets online before go and have them printed off.

Disneyland we went late afternoon through to about 9pm, there were still heaps of people and the only real time you could get on some of the rides without a huge wait was when the electric lights parade was on as people went to watch that. If you have small kids they probably won't enjoy it as much as the queues can be from 30 minutes to 410 minutes. Food at the carts like popcorn etc largely has long lines as well, the food outlets in buildings were not as bad. Easy to get to using the train, you can also buy tickets in some 7 eleven stores and the wait did not look long at the counters so probably cheaper to buy tickets in Japan versus offshore.","Written April 9, 2018",3.0 of 5 bubbles

744,Such a let down,"I know we went at a bad time (sakura season) but I wasn't expecting what we experienced at all. And a fair amount of it wasn't even due to the amount of people.

When we initially arrived in the late morning, the station wasn't that busy, there was barely a small queue to get in and then it just seemed like any disney park, until we passed the shops and got near the rides...

The queue for the Jungle Cruise extended so far beyond that they not only needed ropes, but a woman with a sign that said ""beginning of the queue""!! Somehow that only took 55 minutes, and fortunately was worth it. The ride was great.

But after that, we thought we'd check out Splah Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain and hopefully get a fast pass. Well, there were no fast passes, and the queue was 180 minutes (3 hours) for Big Thunder Mountain, and 230 minutes (nearly 4 hours) for Splash Mountain!! We'd have queued for one and they day would nearly be over!

Instead we thought we'd walk around the park and then wait for Star Tours regardless of the queue because we both really wanted to go on it. The queue for Star Tours was (at this point) ONLY 70 minutes, so we got in line, and again it was worth it.

Now normally, I love walking around the Disney parks. I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to rides so I've spent a lot of time holding coats and bags and enjoying taking in my surroundings. Tokyo Disneyland felt barren. I don't think I saw a single hidden Mickey, the theming was so basic, and it almost felt like a knock off attempt at Disney. Other than the initial entrance area with the enclosed shops and the New Orleans area, the decor was a joke.

Fortunately the food was really reasonably priced, but we had to wait for 10+ minutes for a turkey leg to get cooked without anyone saying anything other than ""sorry"" to all of us that were waiting for food. Even to Japanese speaking people, there was no explanation of ""we're just waiting on X"" or anything. The honey popcorn was really tasty though.

I also only saw one drink stall the entire time we were there, so if you wanted a drink anywhere else in the park, you had to queue for counter service which was a pain. Jungle Cruise had a water fountain 40 minutes into the queue, but it didn't work. It was 25 degrees C the day we were there, so drinks were a little bit more needed.

And the park is tiny!! It would probably only take a max of 40 minutes to walk around it without queuing for anything. And I barely noticed any benches either.

All in all we were thoroughly disappointed after 4 hours only being able to go on 2 rides (unless we wanted to queue until kicking out time for only 1 more ride), and I wouldn't recommend visitng to anyone that's been to Florida Disney World or even Disneyland Paris, because you'll be let down immediately, whether it's packed or not.","Written April 9, 2018",2.0 of 5 bubbles

Highly recommended for those who is first time in Tokyo and never been to Disneyland before.","Written April 7, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
750,Magical Park,"My family (kids 7 & 10) and I visited Tokyo Disney on 3/22/18 and it was a great experience. This was in March so the weather was in the 50's - 60's, very nice and comfortable. We arrived around 45 minutes before the park opened and there was already a line of around 1,000 people or so. Because it was during Spring Break, many kids in Japan were also on break. One takeaway we noticed was that there were not many adults in line. Many of the kids (some even looked like they were in elementary school) visit the park with just their friends. I guess because it's Japan and safer than the US, kids are more independent.

Many of the rides are the same as Disneyland so when the park opened we immediately went for Pooh's Honey Hunt which is a lot better than the Disneyland ride. Definitely take advantage of the FastPass which allows you to get another one once the time period for the current pass occurs. Pooh's Honey Hunt is on a trackless track and if you get motion sickness, you may want to avoid the ride because it does have some spins and visual effects which can make people dizzy.

The big thing about Tokyo Disneyland is the flavored popcorn. We did notice that around 1 in 5 kids in the park do carry the character container so we purchased one as well. We tried honey, chocolate, soy sauce butter and bbq with soy sauce butter being our favorite. We also searched for different foods that are unique to Tokyo Disney and tried pizza spring rolls from Toon Town and Star Wars mochi from Tomorrowland. Both were pretty good.

The daytime parade ""Happiness is Here"" was okay. Our kids liked the various characters but we preferred the Disneyland and California Adventure parades more because there was better music and dancing. The Tokyo parade was very structured with a bike in front, main float and followed by the some dancers.

We only spent 1 day at the park but thought it was sufficient. Since we already been to Disneyland multiple times and DisneyWorld, our kids were already familiar with 85% of the park. 1 more day would have been nice but we wanted to spend more time in other areas of Japan.

Overall it was a great magical experience and when we visit Japan again, we will definitely make a trip to Disneyland.","Written April 6, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles
751,Get Fast Pass Tickets To Avoid Queues,"First time in Disneyland and enjoyed it. The Lilo and Stitch Musical Show was great! Even though it was for kids, my sibs and I are big fans of Disney. We were given a gadget that has English translation of the show so we could understand it. We regretted that we have not come earlier during the day since all the Fast Pass ticket counters were closed. Queue lines were at 150mins waiting time especially for the good ones. The One Man's Dream show is great but nothing Disney babies haven't seen before.

Milk Chocolate Popcorn was the best! There's a different canister worth 2300JPY in each popcorn stall. There's McQueen, Cinderella in her carriage, Darth Vader, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Mr. Potato Head, Buzz in his box, Olaf, Stitch, Minnie's ribbon. Disney Sea has Nemo, Duffy, Ariel's seashell.

If you don't mind walking for almost 20 mins, Tokyo Disneyland is almost 2km walk away from Maihama Station and I suggest to just walk there. Riding the Disney train to Disneyland costs 260JPY per adult. The walk to Disneyland is entertaining mostly because of the views. You can opt to use an IC card to pay or to buy the tickets.

I advise others to visit the Disney store (2F) at Ikspiari Shopping Mall (just near Disney Resort Train) to find more Disney princesses merchandise. The items sold at Disneyland is mainly focused on Mickey Mouse and friends. Stores per themed category houses characters or merchandise of the said theme only. There are a whole lot of variety items and goodies at the Disney store if you're looking for more.

Also, there's an express train from Tokyo station to Maihama and vice versa. Just ask the staff at the information center to know what time it would arrive.

We were there on a Tuesday and the park already seemed crowded. I can't imagine going there on a holiday or a weekend. Check the TYO Disneyland crowd predictor before buying your tickets to ensure walking with less people.

For the show schedule during the day, don't forget to grab a map (it includes the show schedules) after passing through the gates. Look for the English ones (I think they're the blue ones). Don't rush here. Just ensure that you get the right map with the schedules so you wouldn't waste time. The park's massive so be sure to use your time wisely in case you only have 1 ticket for that park.

If you have a self-printed ticket, don't fold the part where the QR codes are located to avoid any delays. Your ticket is needed in order to avail a Fast Pass (FP) ticket (check the map to see if the attraction has FP) for almost all famous attractions. If you availed one at 8:30, you can avail another FP ticket by 10:00-10:30 (the exact time when you can use it again is indicated in the FP ticket) so be sure to come in early to avoid long queues.

Bringing of snacks is allowed. Bringing of lunchboxes or any other heavy food is not. Snacks, candies, and bottled waters are all okay to bring. I suggest to bring a lot since the cheapest amount of food I saw there was 1,280JPY per person. Our family survived by eating 350JPY worth of popcorn every time we're hungry.

Lockers are available inside and outside the park. If you wanted to bring your own lunch, leave them there then have an attendant put a stamp on your hand when you go out and eat it so you could come back.

Wear comfortable shoes as you would have to queue and walk from one place to another for at least 500 meters every single time.","Written April 6, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Information Boards - Shanghai have got this spot on, lots of information at different parts of the park digitally updated. I realise perhaps 99.9% of Japanese will check queue information on the app but as a visitor I didn't have this option (no cellphone or app). I felt like i was wasting time (to save time) running back and forth to the information board near the entrance. It was updated with stickers (?) and it was just the one board. Come on Japan, you can get high tech here. It would help. China have got this sorted.

Tomorrowland - Aesthetically it felt like a blue car park. Shibuya is more like the land of tomorrow! Other Disney Parks have much better feeling futuristic areas.

The queues.... they were really bad.

The good - Popcorn flavours - really nice choices. The flowers were all very beautiful. The atmosphere is really good. The natural birds, ducks, cherry blossoms, are very inspiring.

760,Fab Feb 14th,"I have never expected to be that good but since I was with the person enthralled with the Disney culture I could not have asked for more.

Emotions aside, the place is vivid and fun. However, there are two advises worth to take note:

1) never enter the Disneyland on any Weekend or national holiday. Even on Thursday, we saw huge crowds. The longest ride to wait for was the Thunder Mountain (even with the fastpass). So, come as early as possible and abuse the fastpass system. Because while you wait for one ride it is possible to try other attractions that do not have fastpasses.

2) I think I just wrote my second one. The fastpass line. Do note, that during one day it is limited to have up to 3-4 passes. However, while spending the whole day take note of which lands have the biggest surpluss of incoming people and what kind of age are they.For example, the Pinocchio and Winnie the Pooh rides are rather crowded during the day because of the sheer number of families. On the other hand, most of them leave after 19-20 hour, thus, freeing the rides up.

766,A fun day at Tokyo Disneyland,"One of my travel goals is to visit all Disneyland parks in the world. I must say Tokyo Disneyland is definitely the best one I ever visited so far.

The entire park is really clean and very organised. Yes, there are millions visitors here everyday. But I didn't feel disorganization at all. I wasn't too sure the day that we visited there is during Japan school holiday or not, but we did see a lot of youth/ students during the day. However, I am amazed how polite how educated these Japanese youth/ students are. For example, everyone is naturally line up for a photo opportunity. No one is cranky up, everyone is so happy while they are waiting. Once it's their terms, each group will take time to take their photos. People really respect each other. I have to say Japanese culture and social awareness are definitely at a different level compared with a lot of countries. I love it and I feel I can learn more from their culture to gain more value for my personal life.

There are few things I would recommended for visiting Tokyo Disneyland:

1. Take a Disneyland motor rail/Subway (Whatever you call it) to the park. It is located out of the Tokyo CBD area which it is quite expensive to take Taxi there compared with other public transportation. For example, It costs us around $150.00 AUD to reach to the place from Tokyo metro area (We were aware of the taxi can be bit costly, It is only because we were at a different suburb shopping in the morning. So we couldn't be bothered to find the motor rail station and that's fine for us to take the taxi). We did take the motor rail back to Tokyo station after the visit where the train station is just outside of the park. It is very convenience to travel with these motor rails in Tokyo. I think from memory, the ticket costs around 490Yen (Equivalent to $6 to $7 AUD) per person one way to Tokyo station.

2. Buy a Disneyland theme headpiece (I call it Mickymouse ears) and ware it during your visit regardless your age and your gender. It may sounds bit funny now, but trust me, you will feel funnier if you don't wear one while you are there. Everyone wears different ears in the park, everyone puts their effort in to make this visit even more enjoyable. A lot of students wear their school uniform purposely, so they can just be identical. Some people wear the same clothes, same shoes and carry the same type of bags. If you really don't buy it, at least wear your favorite one and take a photo to bring back some nice memory. Hey, it is Disneyland - A magical world for us...why don't we put little bit efforts in for this fun moment. Enjoy your life!

3. Take a 4 wheels cabin size suitcase - Yes, you read it correctly...A lot of people bring their suitcase (small size) with them during the visit. There are thousands cute things you can find there, especially people who love shopping like me... Again you wouldn't feel odd if you push a suitcase around in the park because a lot of people do the same. You will blend in while you are there. There are also lockers available if you don't want carry so many shopping bags around. Don't underestimated these gifts (Packaging of Japanese products are breathtaking, they are all well presented and pay attention to details)...Once you see them and you will lose control...like me : )

You will need a full day to visit Disneyland and another day for DisneySea. Take your time and enjoy it. If you have an opportunity, I recommended to stay at the Disneyland Resort for couple days.

We really enjoyed the day at the Tokyo Disneyland, Even my ""Boring"" boyfriend loved it and said me that he would like to stay at Disneyland resort for couple of days on our next visit to Tokyo ...Yeah!!! : )","Written March 29, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

I have no issues with long queues as it is expected of Disneyland but this time I can‚Äôt help feeling that the speed of the ride when you get on is too fast. For example Winnie the Pooh, the cars felt rushed just zipping from one spot to another. Was not able to appreciate the ride fully in this instance.

Mostly it was hell on earth due to the IMMENSE crowding from school holidays. We had no choice but to go on this date; make sure you know when the japanese holidays are and never go on a holiday. Crowds were insane. 200 minute wait (yes two hundred minutes) for the more popular rides, even early in the day at around 1030am. Personally I don't understand why anyone would wait that long for a single 5 minute ride. Hungry? Lines for food are around thirty minutes. People were using window sills as tables to eat their food as all the tables were occupied. Fast passes all ran out by 1230pm. Also, the most ""thrilling"" coasters are all but underwhelming. Very very tame. Sudden left and right turns and that's about it. If you came here for thrill seeking you absolutely came to the wrong theme park.

My advice is to buy your Disneyland tickets in advance so you can enter the park without delay. Then, make sure you fully know how the fast pass system works so you can make the most of it, it will help with the queues. And don't come on a Japanese holiday.

All in all an unenjoyable day due to the ant-like crowding, taking away from the magical atmosphere that disney is supposed to have, and rides all aimed at children. Not for adults.","Written March 28, 2018",2.0 of 5 bubbles
771,Prepare to queue for hours,"I have been to Disneyland in California three times in the last 10 years and can say that the waiting times for popular rides in Tokyo Disneyland were a lot longer - it took me about 2.5 hours to get into the Splash Mountain. Between 10.30 in the morning and 6pm, I managed to get into 4 rides or shows. There were just too many people even on a school day. Even to buy food, there‚Äôs always queues.

It did not help that some parts were closed for construction. The electric parade was good and the travel to and from the venue was easy by trains.","Written March 28, 2018",2.0 of 5 bubbles

To finally do this at the Tokyo Disneyland property was probably fortuitous, compared to, say, anecdotes about the American alternative experience. My recent experiences in Japan have all been blessed by the awesome gracious conduct of the Japanese people. So to see groups of young Japanese people really immersing themselves in the flavour of Disneyland, by dressing up accordingly, in pairs or mixed groups, reflecting their favourite Disney character or theme, was just simply charming. The Japanese do naivety so well! Nearly every visitor was thoroughly into their day‚Äôs experience, with their allegiances visibly shown by either their homework preparation or by their worn purchases. So do I really need to mention the ridiculously long queues or the great expense - you probably already know about these. But to share these cons with Japanese people was so much more bearable than it would be anywhere else in the world. Go for it!","Written March 27, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Due to a school holiday, the place was absolutely packed! We originally wanted to go to Disneysea but this was closed for day passes due to the high number of people. So we went to Disneyland instead but we should‚Äòve better just gone home. The lines were crazy! Even to buy an ice cream, you would have to queue for 30 minutes. Fasttrack passes on all good rides were gone and regular waiting times for popular rides were up to 4 hours! We ended up not going on a single ride. I am just not up for waiting in line for 3+ hours for one single ride.
We left the park one hour after entering and tried getting a refund - to no avail.
To anyone considering going - check the date first and if you go during peak season, go early and make sure you know the Fastpass system.

We recommend either Pirates of a Caribbean or Jungle cruise, less waiting time. This time we tried the Tree House, where located in front of Tiki room. No lines and enjoyed a lot. Just up and down the Tree House, but felt so much nostalgic like been in a childhood again. When you are in Adventure land worth trying. Have a wonderful time there.

Most of the attractions like the 4D movie and performances were in mostly Japanese but still our kids loved it. Most lines were super long but they moved quickly.

781,Great fun but tiring,"The park is relatively small compared to the one at LA (the only other one that I've visited).
Popcorn tubs & flavours differ at each stall (Darth Vader head + salted popcorn @ Tomorrrowland, Cinderella Carriage+ chocolate popcorn@Fantasyland, Olaf + caramel popcorn @ Toontown, flying Dumbo tub is opp Pooh's house to name a few)

Food options wise
- the food at the Queen of Hearts Banquet hall (@Fantasyland) is over rated; but they do have a good q system whereby you q and pay AND pickup your food b4 you grab a seat.
- Huey, Dewey & Louie's good time cafe @Toontown does a good Mickey-head shaped pizza or a chicken bun
- if the weather is good, a picnic will be a good option.

Before your visit:
1. Check the weather & the Disneyland crowd calendar
2. Buy and print out your tickets
3. Check the park opening hours - may differ with seasons
4. Go early - aim to get there at least 45mins to 1 hour before opening time. The queue to go in forms more than an hour before the park opens.
5. Plan your route around the park esp if you have small children. There are height restrictions for certain rides.
6. Get a Fastpass for a ride the first thing you get into the park
7. Then go and Q for another ride.
8. Take note of the time that you can obtain another Fastpass (it will be written on the first Fastpass ticket)
9. Take note of the parade timings and bring a groundsheet (can be found at ¬•100 stores) else can just use an open park map as a buffer between your butt and the floor.
10. Be prepared to be patient-There are long queues for the rides/shows, queues at most food outlets and long queues for the washrooms too.
Tip: there is a fab babycare/kiddycare room at tomorrowland with separate rooms for diaper changing, feeding, nursing and even for daddies and mummies to use. They sell baby food n snacks too!

We did not buy our tickets on line which ended up being a good thing. The line for ticket holders was very long! The line to buy tickets only had around 10 people. We timed it that when we bought the tickets the park opened at 8 and we were able to squeeze in at the front of the crowd.
Today is the first day for the kids in Tokyo spring break so I think every kid was here. Since it‚Äôs easy to get to by the JR train they just hop off and your here.
Everyone runs in and the staff asks them kindly to slow down and walk. That was not happening. Thunder mountain was already a 3 hour line and this place has only been open for 30 min!
Will go on a few rides but no way a 3 hour wait. Even the line for fast pass was an hour. Hey it‚Äôs Disney, you kind of expect it.

It offers most of the tried-and-true favorites our kids love from the States, with a few fresh twists. One of the kids' favorite rides was Pooh's Hunny Hunt -- different than the Pooh rides stateside. While it was freezing during our late January visit, lines were short -- like a slow day in the States at a Disney park -- so I'd recommend wearing a down parka and braving the cold! Food is ""meh"", probably worse than the American parks, but that wasn't a surprise. We thought the flavored popcorn that is so hyped here was mediocre at best. Overall, though, a great experience, and while I would not make a special trip to this park from the US, it was fun to visit since we are living in Asia. True Disney nuts will want to check out DisneySea next door, as it offers an experience that is unique among the parks worldwide.","Written March 18, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Certain things were fairly similar/the same as the Orlando one, and some things had a Japanese touch which was nice. Yes, it was crowded, but when is Disney not crowded. The lines for the rides weren't ridiculously long (but they were at Disney Sea), so we were able to go on quite a few. The Fast Pass thing is convenient, but you've gotta plan carefully as you have to wait a certain amount of time after getting one Fast Pass before you can get another one. Also, you'll have to walk all over the park if you want to get Fast Passes for the rides they offer them for. I was disappointed that the characters in costumes aren't simply walking around the park for photo opportunities. Most of them simply appear at designated areas for a certain time, and the lines to have your picture taken w/them are quite long and in my opinion not worth it. We only had out picture taken w/two characters that were walking around; the others required lining up. The gift shops, though abundant, basically sold the same things in almost every shop which was disappointing. There were only a few unique gift shops, and I was hoping for more. The food wasn't bad, and the prices weren't quite as high as I expected, but being Disney, you know you're gonna pay a lot anyway.","Written March 15, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

As it was just me and my partner there wasn‚Äôt a lot rides to go on as most rides are for children and the good rides have massive lines. I recommend going about half hour before opening as the lineup to get in is absolutely massive! Once you get in the park, straight away go and book a ride on the fast pass machines, research which rides you wanna do and book them straight away. Unfortunately you cant book multiple at once but whichever you want to do the most book that immediately. The fast pass gives you a one hour times slot for you to jump towards the front of the queue. If you dont book, you will be waiting at least an hour for every ride.

794,Deppressed depply dissapointed and very deppressed,"Ok so I've never thought of giving a such a bad rate to something that I hold so close to my heart. But I need to say the truth.

I was having a bad time in my Tokyo Vacation, Japan is difficult to navigate and language is hard not many speak english and not to mention spanish so I thought well I need something to take the edge off. And I saw a poster for Tokyo Disneyland. I visited Disneyland when I was 8 years old and I remember little things but mainly that it was the happiest moment of my life. Period. And now in my 35 years of age I thought screw this: Im going to feel like a kid again. I want to take pictures with Belle, sing with Elsa, bother Gaston, yell ¬°Andy is coming! and if everything goes well take a picture with Ariel. My favorite princess on the entire world, from first movie I saw in my life and that I held dear in my heart. I was so excited.

So I got to Disney Tokyo, lines were big but advance fast and easy I paid around 50 USD to enter it was 9:30 am I think and I saw a nice band swinging all the Disney Themes. My heart was filling with joy. I started to feel happy. A whole day of being a kid again and feeling happy.

I went to have breakfast to a Dinner like restaurant and they offered two courses, Chicken Curry and French Toast I already had a lot of curry in my Japan visit so I switched to French Toast and it was creamy and delicious. So I pull the map out and started to trace my visit. And noticed one pop corn stand! Natural & BBQ. Ok maybe pop corn later.

Star Wars first, it was a fun experience and the line was not very long I did around 20 - 25 mins. Another Pop Corn Stand Natural & Cheese.

So whats next, I went to Toon Land, oh another Pop Corn Stand Natural and Curry... this is funny maybe Japanese like their popcorn. I got to another attraction and it was more kid oriented. Oh well...I was thinking this doesnt seem like I remember I remember it was much more dynamic, and theres no characters out yet...maybe later...

Then an announcement in Japanese along the park started and then the translation in English. Something like: ""We are sorry to inform you that due to weather (snow) the Frozen event will be canceled..."" oh the irony Damn you Elsa!!!! Oh and guess what yup popcorn: natural and teriyaki.

Then started to cruise the park and something around 3 of 5 of the attractions were closed. And after walking around a bit more I ended where I started and saw the band. I think I counted 10 or 8 popcorn stands of different flavors, never found caramel the ones I like. And also no Dole Whip.

Now I think ok maybe Cinderella is in the castle. And nope. Mainly its a museum of the Cinderella story with pictures and the crystal slipper. And Cinderella looks like a sex doll with her mouth opened in a weird way.

To say I was dissapointed is quite an understatement I was actually deppressed. No princess was on sight the only character was Goofy and he was surrounded by a marabunta of visitors.

Maybe I remember Disneyland in a different way. Maybe it was a constructed memory. I think I dropped two or three tears for my former self. And went to the exit.

In conclusion: Theres stores of Disney merchandise everywhere, really few rides (that work). No characters. Lots of popcorn stands. The french toast was really good. And the ice cream parlor was closed. Screw me. Most deppresing place in the world. But hey I got the best french toast I ever had.","Written March 7, 2018",1.0 of 5 bubbles

Absolutely loved that they had the characters Walking round the park meeting people like they used to at Florida.
It felt very crazy compared to Florida but so worth a visit.
They operate the old school fast pass ticket system so get there early to get your tickets as they stop issuing them very early in the day. Queues are slow otherwise.
Customer service was good although can you ever beat American customer service?
As a vegetarian family we really struggled to eat in Tokyo and this was also the case at Disney, with just 3 restaurants offering vegetarians options. One you had to have reservations for and the other was a coffee house so we were limited to one place and a plate of pasta.

Boy was I wrong. The staff are all super happy. If they don‚Äôt speak English and 90% did they apologised and translated on phones or called someone over.

The park it‚Äôs self is beautiful. The castle is amazing. Rides wore fantastic, yes they had ques but what Disney park doesn‚Äôt.

Winnie the Pooh exclusive to Disneyland tokyo was probably the best fantastic.

Tips - arrive to the park early. 10 minutes before means nothing. If you have extra 15 minutes for staying in a Disney resort get there for 7:15 latest if not get there for 7am latest. Best Fastpass to get is Winnie the Pooh first as excellent for everyone and goes within 2 hours normally after that do what you wish but make sure you get a fast pass every 2 hours as saves so much time.

The parades are best I have seen I have been all but Shanghai but Tokyo just do it right. Parade was fantastic and electronic nightshow was out this world. Mind blowing. The fireworks at the end of the night wore nice but missed that Disney sparkle no real theme to it but still nice (fireworks can be seen from both parks and isn‚Äôt directly from castle to left of castle we stood next to Walt and Mickey bronze statue at centre of near entrance of park make sense when see and view was good.

Overall excellent experience highly recommend. Yes some rides in Japanese and don‚Äôt understand but it‚Äôs Disney you
Can get what‚Äôs going on.

Overall if your in between going just go you won‚Äôt regret it!

Last tip go for weekdays obviously check make sure not school holidays but time difference was about 45 minutes for best rides minimum wait time. Also stay in Disney resort if afford extra 15 minutes priceless.

805,It was crowded even on a Monday but we still loved the experience!,"Pros
1. It is Disneyland and the staff is amazingly cheerful
2. The park is very clean
3. It‚Äôs easy to get there via the subway system
4. While it‚Äôs crowded, the people obey etiquette by not screaming or pushing or cutting
lines
5. Fast Pass can save you hours
6. Relatively inexpensive (get your tickets via klook)
7. It‚Äôs a different experience than the US and much more civil than Shanghai

Cons
1. It‚Äôs crowded (we were there on Monday and it was still crowded)
2. Inefficient Fast Pass System (why can‚Äôt every Disney adopt Orlando‚Äôs Fast Pass
system?)
3. Shows and rides are mostly in Japanese (However, you are in Japan and that‚Äôs
what makes it a unique experience)
4. The food isn‚Äôt quite as good and the lines even for a churro are ridiculous

Tips
1. Get your tickets through klook as the park‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt let you purchase tickets with your credit card
2. Be there early and take food. They search your bags and it says food is not allowed but people had food and they didn‚Äôt care.
3. Know it will be crowded and accept that fact or else you will be bummed out the whole day, so go with an open mind.
4. Take cash
5. When they first open, walk quickly to your favorite ride and get a fast pass. Line up for your second favorite ride. Finish that ride and then use your fast pass and get another ticket for your next favorite ride. Line up for your next favorite ride and repeat this process. Do this as quickly as possible or you will be screwed because wait times can be 2 and a half hours long for a ride even on a cold, chilly Monday in February!

813,Pick your day carefully,There's lots of information online suggesting when you should and shouldn't go to Tokyo Disney. There's no exact science but make sure you learn from my mistake and avoid local public holidays. Unfortunately we didn't know Monday 12 February was an observed public holiday until it was too late (I usually check but somehow missed this one). We wanted to go to Disney but we only had one day of our holiday left so took a chance. We arrived at about 10:30am and the line to get in was short. Once we were inside though it went downhill from there. The lines to most of the rides was between 60 and 120 minutes. As you're only allowed one Fast Pass ticket at a time the next available slot on Space Mountain we could get was 2pm. Splash Mountain had a 180 minute wait and we were told we couldn't queue (not that we would have for that long). The Big Thunder ride was out of order adding to the length of queues at other rides no doubt. We basically walked around for four hours with a gentle Siberian breeze blowing through whilst avoiding bumping into other people as we pushed through the crowd. I even went on the carousel (20 minute wait) just so I had a sense of getting some value for money (¬•7400 entry fee). We rode Space Mountain once but that proved underwhelming to the point we handed over our other Fast Pass tickets to a couple of poor buggers waiting at the back of the line. As we were leaving people were still flocking in through the gates. I can't imagine how long they'd have to wait for any rides or attractions. I've been to Disney in Paris and Hong Kong as well as Universal Studios in Singapore. The lines were shorter and the rides and attractions were much better at all of them.

Shows and some rides/attractions in Japanese only so avoid them if you can and don't want to waste valuable ride time. The night time parade was fantastic and the day time parade was good also. We wasted some time waiting for the frozen parade which oddly sung some songs in english and then 'let it go' in japanese?!? Best rides were probably in tomorrowland and also splash mountain.

The variety of souvenirs were way overwhelming!! Ranging from food to home wares to clothing and accessories!
Although food was not terrible in taste unlike other theme parks and also the presentation were very nice. Some of the food comes with an option to purchase souvenirs like cutlery or plastic containers in selected characters design on top of the food item.
The bathroom were not dirty although can be cleaner, drier in certain ones.
There are lots of stroller parking spaces and staff who helped to arrange them neatly.
Chocolate flavored popcorn were not well coated with chocolate in fact we couldn't taste much of chocolate. The special Cinderella popcorn bucket cost ¬•2300 and comes filled with popcorn.
Pick up the park map right after passing through the security and then the turnstiles. There are various languages in English, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese among others.

828,Many attractions are closed and or break!,"I have been to Tokyo Disneyland about 30 times over 10 years, so my review is based on many experiences, which sadly are all the same.

Is Tokyo Disneyland crowded? No, it is overly crowded, but you expect this, so no worries. Although females waiting for 45 minutes in a toilet line during peak season is no fun. I go so often, I have developed a system to keep my family entertained despite the challenges.

So why do I give the land where dreams come true a bad rating. 2 reasons.

1. There are always rides that are closed. On a recent trip, the space ship rides and go-carts, and surrounding area is closed. To be fair, they are permanently closed as a new ride is being made. I could be wrong, but it feels like it‚Äôs been two years already in construction. With that aside, there is ALWAYS other rides closed for something. Last weekend Small World, Go Go Gadget roller coaster and Haunted House were closed. Last year, it was Big Thunder Mountain, Small World and Jungle Cruise. With the current construction, whose decision was it to close other rides as well for upgrades? Terrible management. As I said, Tokyo Disneyland is very crowded and when several rides are always closed, what happens? Correct, longer lines elsewhere.

2. Rides ALWAYS have problems. With the construction, closure of other rides and then closure of the remaining rides makes for an awful experience. This past weekend, Big Thunder Mountain and Jungle Cruze both closed in the afternoon due to ‚Äúproblems.‚Äù This on top of the fact that those two rides were closed for improvements most of last year. Again, terrible management.

So, permanent closure of some rides with the construction mess, plus the ongoing closure of other rides, plus the frequent problem closure of remaining rides leads to an extremely disappointing and expensive day or weekend.

833,Converted by Disneyland Tokyo,"I've never really understood the obsession people have with Disneyland, but we were staying in Tokyo for 10 days with small children so through it would be a different way to spend a day.

We had a fantastic day. We had a3 year old and 5 month old with us so didn't go on any of the big rides. We still had a packed day from when the park opened to about 7pm. We went from zone to zone doing all the smaller activities: boat rides, train ride. We didn't queue for anything other than the dumbo ride for more than 15 minutes. The dumbo ride had an inexplicability long queue but our three old really wanted a go so we waited (it was only worth waiting for 35 minutes if you are three through).

We took a pushchair which was fine as outside the rides aimed at the age group there was generally a designated parking place for pushchairs.

We really enjoyed the parades and we saw three. The light based one at the end of the day was my favourite but if you stay for that take warm clothes - we were freezing. It is super well organised and even though the park was busy we were easily able to get a good view for each one. It is incredibly ordered the way the first to arrive laid out little mats and sat on the floor so that people behind got a good view.

You have to ""suspend your disbelief"" quite a bit as nothing is real here. There was a couple of moments where this really jumped out at me 1) we were on the stream train and it went into a tunnel, normally this means you get lots of smoke and steam coming back over the carriages, here nothing, they are able to turn off the steam but it still be able run just fine 2) on the Cruso Family Treehouse even the tree was made of plastic. I'm pretty sure that even the lovely maple syrup small from some of the food venues was piped in.

The park was immaculately clean and tidy - i don't think we saw any litter whilst we were there.

Be prepared to spend quite a bit of money, the entrance fee, food, the compulsory soft toys when you have small children. It is certainly not a trip to do if you are on a budget.

I still don't really understand how grown adults can get quite so excited dressing up in their disney hats and merchandise but I did leave thinking when the kids are a bit older maybe we should take them to Disneyland again.","Written January 28, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

By 11 am it became a struggle to get around the park due to the major crowding. Food lines were just as bad as rides with 30-40 minutes wait for some soggy fries and dry brownie. We spent 7 hours at the park and made it on two rides. Even the gift shops had limited merchandise compared to Disneyland LA it seemed to mainly stock princess and Disney original character products. Disneyland should take a page out of universal studios book and limit the number of guests to at least half the number who attended when we were there. A rip off and waste of a precious day overseas.

We were very impressed by the varieties from the 3 separate parades, 2 during the day and 1 in the evening. Each parade has different dance groups as well as cartoon themed floats. The night parade was amazing, lots to see and beautiful to watch. Park is huge and offered many rides, performances, restaurants and shops. We were lucky that we visited on week day so it was not too crowded. The express pass was easy to follow and saved us lots of times.

844,Worst Disneyland ever,"Just keep in mind that this was their off season as it was winter in Japan.

Having been lucky enough to go to the original Disneyland and Disneyworld in Florida, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty well versed in the standard that Disney tends to keep.

Tokyo Disney was over crowded, there seems to be no form of crowd control considering me and my friend had to wade through pools of people almost constantly.

They had little to no characters, we only saw a very badly done green army man who was out for maybe two minutes.

There were excessive lines for everything! And I mean everything, an hour wait for a bloody popcorn machine! All the food vendors had lines almost as long as the rides!

Not to mention the rides, they all seemed to get closed down at random intervals for reasons they wouldn‚Äôt explain. We managed to get to the front of one ride just before it reopened but then they told us there would be a TWO HOUR WAIT even though we were at the front! Because they just hand out unlimited fast passes and so for an hour all the people are allowed in front of you and hold up the queue even further! I mean we were at the front with the two hour wait! That line would‚Äôve been a good kilometre long imagine the wait for the people at the end!

Overall they ruin the magic by letting too many people into the tiny version of Disneyland, there‚Äôs no characters you can talk to to balance the ridiculous wait for rides and you have to wait like an hour just to even get a bag of popcorn. We managed to get onto two rides in 8 hours.

858,The best Disneyland I ever been,"Book ticket in advance. Please check the weather before select the date because it might affect your schedule as well. Also please check the entrance crowd from their website, they will have a date which can see roughly how many people enter the theme park. If you don‚Äôt want to go with crowd, select the less people going date. It can be overwhelm if that day the theme park is extremely crowded. Research on Some
Blogger on which ride need to get the fast pass first then plan the route and your time to see the parade. This can save your time and you can enjoy to the max. The parade sometimes you need to go to wait way early before it start. (You will see a lot of Japanese they will start ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù and wait like 3-4 hours before the parade start). Don‚Äôt be surprise , they always the one who can get the best view. Last but not least, don‚Äôt be shy to wear as crazy as possible or put on costume if you go to Tokyo Disneyland. You will have a wonderful day there!","Written January 8, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
859,Disappointing,"A group of us visited here on Christmas Day. As we had purchased Fast Track passes we attempted to book times for the rides, Thunder Mountain etc. The first time available was between 2020hrs and 2120hrs! Now, considering this was about 1100hrs, we were astonished! Our transport back to our hotel was at 2030hrs, so there was no way that we were going to be able to go on it.
A very helpful lady checked to see if we could exchange it for one of the other rides, only to be told that they were also fully booked until those times. The only one available was the Haunted Mansion. Off we went to the Haunted Mansion, only to be told that they were fully booked.
Having been to both Paris and Orlando, I have never had this problem before. I find it astonishing that they can be booked up so quickly and I felt sorry for those that were queuing up in the hope of getting on.
One other aspect that I was disappointed in, there were no characters out and about for photo sessions that you get elsewhere.
Also, all those shops and not one dedicated Christmas shop. I was so looking forward to that.
On a positive note, we still enjoyed our day spent there. The parades were amazing and as with all Disney resorts, it was spotless and the people very friendly.","Written January 7, 2018",3.0 of 5 bubbles
860,Fun,"We visited with our kids who are 18 and 20. This park is a bit kiddie but still fantastic. Pirates of the Caribbean ride is pretty awesome, everything looks very real. Long waits for lines and people everywhere so if you can try and organise a fast pass to get the most out of your day. One ride which you have to do is Winnie The Pooh. Sounds weird but this was our favourite ride. It‚Äôs just amazing. We wanted to go on again but the wait time was 120 minutes. So worth the wait first ride. The parade is gorgeous. Crowds everywhere, staff so friendly and helpful. Just what you expect from a Disney Park.","Written January 5, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

862,Perfect for your Disney Addiction,"This was my first experience doing a Disney park during Christmas time. It was wonderful! We were there Dec 18th-23rd and the park was not crowded at all. The cold weather took some getting used to considering I'm an island girl from Guam and it's basically summer all year long.

Staying on Disney property (Disney Celebration Hotel) helped with the early 15min park entrance. Busses came back and forth every 10 mins or so and weren't crowded in the morning or when the parks were closing. There were a few differences as to compared to other US Disney Parks. There aren't any magic bands. So fast passes were done the original way. You walk up to the attraction, scan your park tickets and get your fast pass. There isn't a memory maker option so pictures are taken by yourself. I think I saw 1 photographer at the main entrance. When characters are out, there isn't a formal line for them. You are basically circled are them and try to squeeze a picture in.

There aren't any refillable cups for sale only popcorn containers. Popcorn seems to be very popular in the parks with an array of flavours (chocolate, caramel, soy sauce, garlic & shrimp, curry, blueberry, salted). Each stand has a different popcorn container that you can purchase for souvenirs and also get refills in them. Depending which area of the park you're in, thats where you'll most likely find its popcorn container character.

We had breakfast at the crystal palace and were able to view the morning parade from our table. Small world was under renovation and also an area of toon town.

Across Disneyland main entrance is Ikspiari (basically a down town disney). We walked there after we left the parks to grab some food and groceries to take back to the hotel. Overall, it was perfect, affordable and absolutely safe. We can't wait to return in April.","Written January 3, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We wandered around all day, staying on to have dinner (which was really good). We managed to go on quite a few rides without waiting too long, although we probably gave the main rides a miss. We had a fabulous day. We had booked tickets online before leaving Australia - 7400 yen for adult and 6400 for junior (roughly AUD$84/$72). Allow plenty of time here as there is a lot to see and do.","Written January 3, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

866,Soo crowded,"We went there on Saturday, Dec 2. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it was the first day of Christmas parade in Tokyo Disneyland. The place was so crowded, we barely play anything. But just walking around watching the parades and enjoying the moment with a little bit of shopping time were a good time for us.
I saluted Japanese. Even though the place was sooo crowded, the restrooms were all at top performances, clean and the toilet seats mostly has heater in it (did I ever mentioned that I freakin loves the toilets in Japan?). Everyone queued with no fuss at all. During the parade shows everyone seated at the front rows, and quietly standing behind the front rows. Totally a culture shock for us.
We loves the shops as well.
The curry rice, we need to queued for 1 hour but it was delicious.
Try the popcorns!
At the end of the shows, the closing time, the over crowded visitors were headed back in order, no fuss. I will definitely going back someday with my family ‚ù§Ô∏è","Written January 2, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

It didn't spoil our day as we worked out the fast pass system and having teenagers skipped some of the younger style rides. We didn't attend any shows as they're all in Japanese, which is fine, but we didn't speak the language and the show attendants told us not to bother which was helpful. The rides are very tame but good fun.

They have english speakers. The staff was so helpful. I was with 2 other adults and 4 children. We all had a great time. We were there over the Christmas holiday and the park was decorated beautifully! It was very cold, so dress warmly! It really did not affect us until the sun went down. We stayed in a Air B&B that was about 10 minutes from the park by bus. Tokyo has the best transportation options I have ever seen. We took the train a few times but I think the bus was a better option, at least to the airport.","Written December 27, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
872,Good but not great ...,"As with most theme parks the earlier you get there the less you have to queue (in theory!), getting into the park was the easiest part and the morning parade was awesome but for a Disney attraction with international appeal, I would have expected to find more employees who could at least speak broken English (I don't mean that disrespectfully but there seemed to be very little desire to cater for tourists). We were there all day and into the evening and seen very few characters and when we did see them they were whisked away by staff within minutes which was disappointing. On the flip side, getting food and drinks were easily accessible and not as expensive as I expected which was a nice bonus after spending a small fortune in the many gift shops there. We went with our teenage kids (16 & 18) who were only really interested in the rides so it was a good day out but not a great day ...

Got to meet a few characters but unfortunately no princesses. Tasty food, and they make for a good photo!

On to the downside first.
Not Princess items being sold here, no costumes and the likes (sorry I have daughters)
The food will definitely be *well over priced but decent.

What‚Äôs great about it - How organized it is and clean - you know how Japan is.

The Parade is nice, explains why people camp out early to be in the front row. Japanese people are so disciplined that the first two rows of people will really stay in place, they won‚Äôt block your view.

Tip: Same as all Disney parks, run to get your Fast Passes already.

Excellent baby care center (the best I had been), they even provide baby bottle washing detergent. 2 days was not sufficient to explore the 2 Parks. I think 4 days will be better. Fast food eateries are widely available but if you would like to dine in the restaurants, you need to book in advance (only for Disneyland resorts/hotels guests). Others need to queue and please bother to queue during the peak meals timing as you will not get a seat. Try after meals hours.

The staff are so happy and so helpful, this added to the experience a great amount. The surroundings are so beautiful and the rides are amazing, especially the Winnie The Pooh ride (I never thought I'd say that!).

Whilst I must admit, DisneySea has the edge and provides a truly unbelievable visit, this was my first experience of Disney Japan and it exceeded all of my expectations but miles.

- Big Thunder Mountain

- Splash Mountain

- Gadget Go Coaster

- Space Mountain (some of the turns are quite sharp, thus the ride is not suitable for young children, etc)

- Star Tours

- Monsters Inc

In addition, the salami pizza at TomorrowLand and the beef steak with rice and the herbed chicken chop with rice at the restaurant at the main shopping area were delicious!

Other amusement park that I had went had shorter lines than this place. We went there when the Christmas deco was up, so some attraction had a Christmas theme i.e The Haunted Mansion. But all were in Japanese so we hardly understand what they were talking about yet we still enjoyed it nonetheless.

Choose your rides wisely as some had shorter line (less than 15 minutes of wait) while the longer line can took up to 60 minutes & over. My kid did enjoyed most of the rides even though some rides were too short (Peter Pan Neverland) than the wait. Food is not much of a problem there as a lot of stalls were selling finger food and sit in restaurants were more than enough. Check the website for which rides took shorter time to queue as it can help you enjoyed more rides. Bring mobile power bank if you love to take pictures.

897,A Cute Novelty for Americans,"As others have noted, if you are a Disney fan and from the US and have visited Disneyland and Disney World in California and Florida several times, this is a cute Disney to visit to check off your World of Disney bucket-list. However, most of the rides are very similar to Magic Kingdom in Florida or Disneyland in California. It is fun to hear many of the rides in Japanese. I went on a Monday in August when some of the schools were back in session, but not all of them, so the park was very crowded still. You cannot get park hoppers and have to actually come into the park to get fast passes (the old-fashioned way--at the machines). You won't need a park-hopper, though, as it will likely take you all day to do each of Disneyland and Disneysea. It was very hot in August and I wore shorts. I was a little worried about this as I remembered that women dress a little more conservatively in Japan. In general, the ladies wore capris, culottes, or skirts, but there were a few women walking around in mid thigh shorts. A hat is strongly encouraged (and of course sunscreen). People were passing out in line waiting for the park to open. The line for tickets was pretty short as most people buy them online and print at home (but you have to have the right size paper to do that). I strongly recommend plenty of water if you are planning to be the first one in the park. There are plenty of online guides to tell you which lines will be the longest and the best way to maximize fastpasses. There are also online guides which can tell you which days will be least busy. If you have an option for when you will be there, definitely check out those guides. Comparatively, I thought the park was a little cheaper than the Florida option, but there are fewer whiz-bang features (like no magic band, photo pass, etc). The Disney cast were all extremely friendly. A few spoke English, but for the most part, there were no language barriers as it is pretty easy to know what people are talking about at theme parks. Disneyland gets 4 stars from me...Disneysea, on the other hand gets 5.","Written December 10, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Organised with typical Japanese attention to detail and punctuality, we were not disappointed. We didn‚Äôt bother with any of the rides as the queues were way too long plus there was plenty to see and enjoy anyway. We would recommend choosing a weekday if possible as the crowds tend to be a little less. Also bring your own food and drink as not only are the prices expensive but you might wait 10 minutes and more in the queue, even for a box of popcorn!

Due to the time constraints, we just took our time to soak in the magical atmosphere and just selected a couple of rides to go on.
Since I am big Winnie the Pooh fan, the Pooh Hunny Hunt ride is must plus it came with highly recommended from friends that have been there. It was a 80 minutes wait for the ride but so worth it plus the cool autumn weather helps as it was not too hot.
We manage to ride other rides such as Stitch Explorer which is more for kids and plus it is all in Japanese so difficult for myself which dont know the language. Then we only had the opportunity to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Snow White and of course another spin on the Hunny Hunt

However, we are really glad we decided to go eventually and even managed to get on many rides with minimal fuss. We decided on getting an After 6 pass plus a full day pass each.
We checked in to Oriental Tokyo Bay Hotel at 3pm and had a nap before taking the Partner hotel free shuttle bus. We skipped the long queues at the ticket counters as we had printed out the tickets at home.
Managed to catch the interactive Stitch 'show' unknowingly - it was in Japanese of course, so we could only get a feel of the atmosphere.
Following that, a quick snack of onigiri (you can actually pack a whole picnic along) before we went to catch the Dream of Lights Parade which was amazing for all of us.
After that we managed several rides at Fantasyland, including the Haunted Mansion and even the Winnie the Pooh ride. This last one was our bonus for that night since we decided to try our luck at 9.50pm and managed to get in within 20 minutes with no Fastpass! (The park closes at 10pm and people were just starting to leave after 10.20pm)
We started the next day slightly later as we had had a late night, at around 10am.
With rain being forecast, the crowds were quite forgiving. We managed to get Fastpasses twice to Space Mountain where my 5yo discovered her love for roller coasters!
Tokyo Disneyland is a must-go especially if you have younger children. Stay at a Disney Resort or Partner hotel as you can rest asap, after a full day of queuing and walking and fun!","Written December 6, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
908,Happiest Place on Earth!,"Made wonderful memories at Disneyland Tokyo which was super clean from shops to restaurants to bathrooms and very baby friendly with proper amenities for toilet training toddlers! That was very convenient .

Lovely cast members who were courteous and knowledgeable.

So many parades that kept us smiling and laughing!

Toddler rides were sufficient to amuse little ones and enough for parents to manage safely!

Food quality and choices could be improved a little and prices could come down a little to appeal to more tourists.

Thanks for the extra big smiles and roaring laughter! We‚Äôll definitely be back for another dose of happy memories.","Written December 6, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
909,Japanese Disney Magic,"We spent 3 days in the resort, one and half in Tokyo Disneyland and one and half in Tokyo Disney Sea. If you have the chance and the time, please spent at least 2 days per park, since they are huge with a lot of attraction and show. If you have less time, you need to make choices and to have a stretegy! To visit this park, spent a night at the Disneyland Hotel to have direct access and happy entry 15-minutes before park opening.
Attractions are classic Disneyland attractions with Spash Mountain my favourite one. Shows are really stunning: One Man's Dream II is really worth one hour wait (you can try the lottery to have a sit, but if you are not lucky you can only go to see the first show in the morning and be prepared to a long wait), it is amazing. The Diamond Horseshoe is also beautiful with a lot of fun, you don't need to speak Japanese to enjoy it but you need to reserve one month before to have a sit. Night show and parade are beautiful, and that is why you would need to spend two night at the park: one for the castle show and parade and one for the Diamond Horseshow. We didn't have the time to enjoy Stitch Luau but will try next time :)
The park in general is wonderful, crowded but tidy.
Staff speak very little English but is enough if you need help.
We ate at: Blue Bayou Restaurant (you need a reservation in advance) that was delicious and amazing, I prefer this one than the one in Disneyland Anaheim that is anyway wonderful; Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall, a really nice fast food, Alice theme; The Diamond Horseshoe for the show, that was quite good.
Definitely a place to visit!","Written December 5, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

If you to Tokyo Disneyland with toddlers then this is the ride you should take. Since this ride is very popular, you need to come early and head to this ride once the park is open. Our kids also enjoyed the Train ride, the Pirates of the Caribbean and the huge tree house.

914,2 day pass,"We brought the 2 day ticket and spent each day at each park. Disneyland was very packed with young families. The atmosphere was very well themed especially since its nearly Xmas too.

Disneysea would probably have to be my favourite park out of the 2. The rides were more suited for adults. Do not miss the Fantasmic show!! It has to be one of the best light/river show I've seen and so well themed with Xmas around the corner. I really enjoyed that.

I like how at disneyland you are issued a fast pass every 2 hrs compared to USJ where you are forced to buy one which is already expensive enough with the ticket alone.

The food is much cheaper here and the turkey leg is sooo delicious!! It was very nice and juicy whereas USJ was very dry. Disney also allow you to bring in outside food.

I downloaded an app which allowed me to see in real time the waiting times for each ride and what time shows were and also which fast pass was issuing at the time. I got my tips and advice from youtuber Tokiyuyu which made both disney and USJ more enjoyable.

I brought my tickets from the Disney store in Shibuya. I had planned to buy of Klook (which i brought my USJ from) but i found that it was cheaper to buy from Disney cheaper even after exchange rates.","Written December 1, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

918,Fantastic day at Tokyo Disney Land.,"I am twenties boy, not really have interest in animation characters, so I did not expect big pleasure there.
Though I had seen a lot of Disney animations in my younger days.
My expectation was wrong and I had great day there.
Characters were so real that I could go back to my childhood, felt seeing movies in front of my eyes.
Parade at night was so wonderful because there was already Christmas season.
Lights, music, costumes were attractive enough.
After that I could watch fireworks, quite long and so beautiful, exactly same as intro of Disney movies.
Also I tried some attractions there.
Many attractions might be boring to adults if you expected thrilling experience though you could see cute characters there, well decorated.
There are some thrilling attractions and I Jet coaster and I was soooo fast and fun, must try it.

919,Crowded and very commercial but nice attractions,"Disneyland Tokyo is rather a big merchandising shop than a theme park. First i was really disappointed because within the first 2 hours i only saw 1 disney figure and of course you have to queue to take a picture. Talking about queuing you have to know that you have to queue everywhere. If you want to ride a roller coaster, you have to queue, if you want to have lunch you have to queue, if you want to buy popcorn you have to queue for at least 30 minutes. Even for the smoking room we had to queue... that was really disgusting.
The only way not to queue for a roller coaster is the fast ticket system. It¬¥s highly recommended that you inform yourself about the fast tickets because it can save you a lot of time. Some of the attractions like the ""Star Tours"" or ""space mountain"" were very nice and we had a lot of fun and also the disney parade was quite impressive and so all in one i dont regret that we went there.","Written November 29, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles
920,Don‚Äôt Travel during November Thanksgiving Weekend,"The attractions are great but the timing of the visit is bad.
Tokyo Disneyland during November Thanksgiving weekend (Friday to Sunday) is too crowded. Wait times for the rides averages between 90-120 mins. It was difficult even just moving around the park. Lines everywhere, popcorn stands even have a queue of around 50 people.

I understand that it‚Äôs all about profit but definitely for guests to enjoy the park there should at least be a limit as to how many people can be accommodated at any given day. A situation where there are too many people becomes dangerous especially when visiting with kids or infants.

I will suggest reconsider the time of year when visiting this park for safety reasons and ultimately, being able to enjoy the visit entirely.","Written November 27, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

Some rides we had to wait only 20mins which blew me away as I was expecting at least 40mins. We got to see everything we wanted to including the parade! It did get busier & busier as the afternoon wore on but that is to be expected. I can‚Äôt wait to visit again! Next time I‚Äôll stay in the Disneyland hotel cause it looked amazing!!

The customer service is pretty good I must say and everythi g is clean and orgnaized. It was raining in the morning of our visit and the stopper park areas were not covered. In one instance where it was raining a bit more I came back to my stroller with an open umbrella covering it to help keep the seat dry - such amazing consideration by the cast members.

The staff were friendly and helpful and I guess they are used to the crowds. Visitors were happy to wait in line for the toilets and believe it or not they have staff doing crowd control in the ladies as well. Waiting time for us at the rides like Pirates of the Caribbean 1 hr 15 mins, Splash Mountain 3 hrs 15 mins, All the other rides including Dumbo were over 2 hr wait in the line. When the parades were on people lined up along the route and sat on plastic mats for over 1 hour to sit in front everyone else had to stand at the back. For us average age 60 we were unable to sit on the ground on concrete for over an hour with legs folded. The park was clean and all the parades were colourful, the Christmas theme beautiful. We waited all day for the fireworks to start at 8.30 and at 7.30 it rained so the whole show was cancelled. Luckily all 4 of us that went have been to Disneyland in LA, Hong Kong and Paris. All of these other parks we were able to move around comfortably and have a wonderful time on the rides. If you had never been to a Disney Land you would not be so disappointed. I would not return to this park again unless they put in place a maximum park capacity. Unfortunately once you pay to get in it doesnt matter if you get on the rides or not and at $90 approx a ticket it was not worth the experience.","Written November 17, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

930,Great park! Lots of fun for everyone!,"I should start by saying we live very close to Disney California and go there regularly. So we are very familiar with the Disneyland experience.
This park was great! Yes it's very busy but if you use the fast passes and hit the smaller rides in between you'll maximize your day! We did almost every ride with-in 8hrs!
Highlight rides:
- Winnie the Pooh's Honey Hunt
-totally different that California Disneys Pooh ride and 100x better.
- Canoe ride
- paddle your way around a river and see animatronic animals and Indians
- Peter Pan (similar to California but better)

Letdown
The only real letdown was the food options. Really not much diversity and not very good. We ended up walking to the Ikspari mall (5min walk) and found a Guzman and Gomez Mexican restaurant that had great food at reasonable prices. There's also a cheap supermarket in the mall for waters and snacks.

931,Awesome experience,"We are originally from California so we have already visited Disneyland Anaheim (many times), as well as Disneyworld in Florida. I thought this location was way better than the two we have already visited. First, Tokyo Disneyland is very clean and organized. People are very polite and friendly. It was also not overcrowded (when we went anyway). Wait time on rides here in Tokyo ranges from at least 2mins to 45mins max. At other locations, wait time on kiddie rides alone starts around 30mins and above. So pretty much, here in Tokyo Disney, we were able to see and experienced all of the rides within a day. Maybe next time, we will add an extra day just to relax and take it slow. The shows are in Japanese but my 7 year old son enjoyed his time here just as much. The light shows, parade and music are just like any other Disneyland, it's magical! Food and merchandises are a bit expensive but it is what it is. They have a Disney popcorn bucket here that is not available in US. A must have if you are a collector.

I do plan on letting my son visit Disneyland all over the world and so far, I can honestly say that our experience here in Tokyo was more relax due to less crowding. So even if you have been to other Disney location, I do recommend TOKYO Disneyland to be added on your bucket list. You won't regret it!","Written November 16, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We queued to meet Mickey for over an hour and were only allowed to take 1 photo. We stumbled across Peter Pan & Tinkerbell. No other opportunities. The parades are good but on a much smaller scale than Disneyland Paris & there is very little merchandise marketed with Disneyland Tokyo (could buy anywhere!). Glad we went but wouldn‚Äôt return.

933,The Happiest Place on Earth,"The slogan really did describe Disneyland as everybody seem so happy, include all the staffs. They seem so happy and enjoy their work so much, they put a great performance and you can see the air is full of happiness.

As you can expect from theme park, especially how crowded is Tokyo Disneyland, the first thing you need to do is grab the fast-pass. The fast-pass is a life-saver in Disneyland, especially for a famous ride. Without this, you might spend 60-100 minutes queuing for a ride.

We got 2, one for Monster Inc. and other for Winnie the Pooh - Honey Hunt. I do like the Monster Inc, which make you looking for monsters with flashlight, but get disappointed with Honey Hunt. Even with my fast-pass, I still queuing for 20 minutes for a short and a bit boring ride.

Other rides that become my favorite is Mickey's PhilharMagic and Haunted Mansion. It feels so magical when I watch the show. It really like my childhood dream of Disneyland. The only minus is all in Japanese so I don't understand whatever they say, but I still can enjoy it so much.

I also fall in love with Disneyland popcorn and their character buckets. Super adorable bucket with delicious popcorn, who can resist that? I ended up with Duffy bucket and 3 different flavors popcorn.

Got seafood pizza,and creamy shrimp calzone. both taste so good.The churros is yummy, and make you want to come back for more.

We all sat on the roadside to watch the afternoon parade and we bought souvenir socks, calendars, key chains and the like in shops.

We waited for the electric parade and fireworks that afternoon but unfortunately it rained. We went home when the announcement came that the electric parade was cancelled due to bad weather. The evening became chilly so the kids decided to go home.

Happiest place to be in for the family but some events were cancelled so we were quite disappointed. Another sad feeling we experienced there were that Stitch's show was in Japanese, we did not understand any of it.

Full serviced restaurants were fully booked almost immediately after opening for booking 1 month in advance. On a less crowded day be prepared to wait 15-20 min on average to queue for a full set of main course. 30 min or more for the popular food during lunch hours.

Most rides are similar to what you will get in other Disneyland. There were plenty of families with kids in tow. The baby Centre is always crowded and packed with babies and parents.

On avg we had to wait at least 30-60 min for a ride. This isn‚Äôt that ideal if u have a baby who cannot handle the wait for too long.

Service staff were helpful in pointing us to the direction of whichever food/attraction. This is in line with the usual Japanese service staff always smiling and willing to help you.

951,Lovely park but some attractions just don't worth the long wait,"It's my second visit to Tokyo Disneyland, last visit being 10 years ago. Being a Disney fan and frequent visitor of other Disneylands, I must say this visit to Tokyo DL wasn't as magical as it was (I did have high expectation). The park is still lovely and I still enjoy Disneyland. I guess what made it less magical this time were the close down (or late opening) of some major rides, the crowds and the cancellation of fireworks (it's really disappointing when you have stood at the perfect spot for an hour waiting for the fireworks to end the magical day but I know it's all up to the weather). Also, I was quite surprised there were so few live shows, and when there was one, it's in Japanese.

But I have to say, the cast members were wonderful. They were so friendly and helpful, sharing joy with guests, simply can't say anything bad about them.

954,Enjoyed our 2 days here,"My friend and I are Disney mad and have never been to any of the other Disney parks so we decided to spend 2 days at Disneyland and 1 at Disney sea. I‚Äôd definitely recommend 2 days to see everything.

The park is located just a short walk from JR Maihama station.
My friend and I do not speak any Japanese besides basic things we remember from highschool.
Menus and the safety Instructions on rides are in English but the dialogue on rides and in shows is in Japanese. We were usually able to figure out what was going on but it definitely added an extra thrill to some of the thrill rides when we didn‚Äôt know what was going on.

A few tips from our experience:
- You can get a map and a list of showtimes (both available in English) at the entry but you have to ask for them
-even in pouring rain, the park was still busy on a Saturday and ride wait times got up to two hours so expect crowds and lines
-Definitely recommend getting a fast pass (a free service that allows you to come back and ride later)for a ride as soon as you arrive at the park and then another as soon as you can. The lines for the fast pass rides get quite long. On our first day we got 1 fast pass and rode the ride but by the time we were finished they‚Äôd reached capacity for fast passes for the day and we were unable to get another.
-When you fast pass, you have an hour time slot to enter the ride so we found getting the next fast pass before the ride more effective.
-In my opinion, though rides were cool, we didn‚Äôt think most of them were worth a 2 hour wait. Though I loved space mountain (we rode it 3 times) so that one probably is.
-If you stay until the park closes and there‚Äôs a ride you‚Äôd like to go on, head straight over there after the last once upon a time castle projection, the queues are normally much shorter. We did this for the Winnie the Pooh ride and were on the ride within around 10 minutes (lines had been around 2 hours for this ride).","Written November 5, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
955,A bit dated but the Disney magic is very much alive,"Kids (and the ""kid"" at heart) will enjoy Tokyo Disneyland. The happiest place in the world (with a Japanese flavor) was packed even on a weekday. We arrived there an hour before it opened as advised by the local residents; it was an advice well appreciated.

Although the rides and attractions are a bit dated (renovations are being done in parts of the park), visitors are still lining up patiently for their turn. Not much variety on food and drinks though.

Tokyo Disneyland is very accessible via the Tokyo subway/train network Just a ride away from the Tokyo Station.","Written November 5, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
956,Good for kids,"Like any other theme parks, do not expect the place to be empty. Since this is Disney, even weekdays are packed! However, I think it is part of the experience.

957,0 out of 5 stars. Crammed like human cattle all day.,"If you want to experience what its like to ride the Tokyo Subway during peak hour for 10 hours straight then head to Disneyland. I could barely move in this park, it was shoulder to shoulder everywhere, absolutely crammed with Japanese high school students, mums and kids. The entire park was absolutely flooded with visitors as far as the eye could see.

We went on the supposedly ""quiet"" Wednesday when crowds were supposed to be at their lowest and it wasnt school holidays either.

To give you an idea of why this park should be renamed ""Sardine Land"" instead of Disney Land, we got there at 8:30am and the line for Space Mountain was already 90 mins. Yes, that's 30 mins after the park was 'open'. Apparently 1000's of people camp outside the park from 6am, queuing inline so they can sprint to the ride of their choice when the park opens 2 hours later

At 10am, the earliest ""fast pass"" for Poohs Honey Hunt was 9.10pm at night.

After 9am, the queues for the major rides exceeded 3 hours.

To even buy popcorn the queue was 40 mins.

I wouldn't be surprised if Scrooge McDuck himself was the CEO of this park attempting to flood the park with visitors to maximize money for himself.

Its a real pity for the great staff who work here having such selfish and greedy Bosses.

Management need to cap visitor numbers.

964,Most magical place on earth (or one of them),"Disneyland is simply magic! That is the best way to describe it, absolute magic!
We bought a 3 day pass for both Disneyland and DisneySea. We loved both of them!

The whole place is absolutely delightful!! All the staff are wonderful, friendly and happy! The rides are lots of fun and there's heaps to do.

The parades are absolute magic! There's a few parades throughout the day and they are all as good as each other. It really is the happiest place on earth!

Seems very obvious but for English speaking tourists, most of the rides and shows are in Japanese so be mindful of that. The performances around the park are in Japanese too and it is beautiful ! The level of talent of all the performers is insane!

Important to get there early in the day and try and get fast passes for the rides. The way the fast passes work: Take your disneyland ticket to the ride you want to go on (choose one with a long wait time that you really want to go on). Go to the fast pass machine located nearby the rides - there should be a clock nearby to tell you what fast pass times they are allocating. Go to a fast pass machine and scan your ticket under it. The machine spits out a little ticket with an hour allocated spot for you to return for the ride. Return to the ride at the allocated time and skip the queue! (you will still have people in the fast pass line with you but not nearly the same as lining up without one). Look on your fast pass ticket for the next time you are able to get a fast pass and make sure to utilize that!!

The queues to get in weren‚Äôt as bad as we‚Äôve experienced in California and the security checks weren‚Äôt as time consuming. All the rides were great; with wait times of varying length. Make sure you organise your day so you can see all the attractions and parades and make wise use of fast passes. We didn‚Äôt think much of the food on offer at Tokyo Disneyland....there weren‚Äôt enough food stalls selling lunch items, but quite a few popcorn stalls. You can refill your novelty bucket with popcorn all day if you want, but you might be waiting in line longer for popcorn than you would for a ride! We ended up booking a restaurant for lunch/dinner at a ridiculous time of 3.30pm but that was the only time available. I‚Äôd advise that if you are wanting to eat something more than popcorn all day, I‚Äôd make time to book a restaurant earlier in your day.

So many people were dressed up (the best was a mother & father dressed as Burt & Mary Poppins on Jolly Holiday - with their two small children dressed as penguins.) The Japanese love Disney and show it in their attention to detail. Most of the rides are very similar to their American counterparts (Pooh's Honey Hunt is quite different and the best Pooh ride I have ever been on.) The parades are over the top and include a lot of the older Disney characters (one float was dedicated to the Aristocats.) Their Electric Light Parade is so much better than the one that is now in California (coming from Florida); it is almost worth the price of a plane ticket just for that. People are allowed to stakeout a spot and to sit during the parades, so lining up in the back is much better and I was (finally) able to see the entire parade.

977,The happiest place ever.,"Tokyo Disneyland is always fun on every visit.

Tips would be to buy your tickets in advance (e.g. Disney hotels, online, or Disney store at Shibuya sells tics too).

Go early at opening 8am to get on the best rides (e.g. space mountain, splash mountain, big thunder mountain) and also make sure you get your fast passes once you reach. There are also fast passes and long queues for certain kids rides like winnie the pooh.

Go back for the night shows, the night electric lights parade starts at 730pm, fireworks 830pm and night show 850pm. It is always packed but you should be able to get a spot where it is all viewable. You are allowed to leave the park and go back later in case you need to go back to the hotel for a rest.

The place is pretty neat and nice, they are so thoughtful that they even have a budget dining table on their guide map. The reason why you have to spend a day there is mostly due to the ride queues. I spent like 30 to 40 minutes waiting time per ride. Therefore I suggest to do a park exploration before joining the queue for any ride so at least you are able to hop onto the rides that interest you should you do not have enough time. In addition, those souvenirs store are absolutely magical. Once you enter into a store, you will come out with a few bags and the magical store will make your wallet thinner and credit card fly.

I would recommend getting a Fast pass as soon as you arrive as the times fill up very quickly. My favourite ride was Splash Mountain! We didn't have a Fast Pass for that but only waited an hour so it wasn't bad at all. My least favourite ride was Peter Pan's Flight; it was very short and the track was jerky.

The food at Disney is great. I tried the milk chocolate popcorn which was absolutely delicious. Curry popcorn was OK. I loved the Halloween special churro which was maple pumpkin flavour and also enjoyed the new Star Wars mochi! We ate lunch at Tomorrowland Terrace which was reasonably priced and filling.

The queues for food and drink were minimum 1 hour. Including water. There are no vending machines or other quick way to grab a water, in the end we barged through an exit to get to a water cooler we spotted as one of us was feeling so faint. (We realise now there were a couple of drinking water fountains in the park but would never have spotted them through the crowds).

I generally enjoy theme parks, but this was horrendous. We basically shuffled around with 80 thousand other people, consoled crying teenagers when it became clear they weren't going to get on any rides, queued up for 30mins for popcorn, waited an hour for a short canoe ride, missed the parades by being stuck in queues. You get the drift.

Apart from that, its a fun park, with pro's and con's in comparision to elsewhere in the world. But then again, you are in Tokyo and not Paris, and comparing those is pointless.

Use the Fastpass - it took us a day to get the hang of it. Grab one (if he queue isn't longer than going on the ride itself - which sometimes you see).

Fastpass is the paper system used in CA, be sure to make use especially on popular rides (and yes the Pooh Honey Pot is worth it)
Don't expect folks to leave as they do in America when it rains..nope..these folks put on ponchos (super sturdy and $9) and stay put.
Don't expect to understand the words spoken on any of the rides. Ask for a translation sheet that tells you the story of the ride. Some rides have actual translators that you can read along with the ride but then you would miss the amazing visuals.
The park itself, the rides, parades are amazing in scope and detail.
Don't expect to find park merchandise or ride tie-ins at the gift shops..expect to find tons and tons and tons of Duffy Bear everywhere.
Don't expect the monorail to be free UNLESS you stay at one of the three Disney hotels. If you stay at any others (even those on Disney property or good neighbors) you have to buy a ticket but can purchase a multiple day one.
Food venues all seem to offer really cool souvenir plates and cups--definitely worth the money and geared toward that particular restaurant.

996,One of the Top Disney Parks,"A great Disney park that is comparable and slightly edges out Disney World in Orlando and exceeds Disneyland in California.

There are several rides that surpass their U.S. counterparts at Tokyo Disney. Not the least of which is Pooh's Honey Hunt. What is a so-so ride in the U.S. is a highlight and a ""must-see"" at Tokyo. I know what you're thinking - and we didn't believe it either! - but there is a reason for the 1-2 hour wait for this ride!

Splash Mountain is another improved upon ride at Tokyo Disneyland. More drops, better theming, and a longer ride, Splash Mountain in Tokyo was a welcome surprise!

Finally, Tokyo took a tired Space Mountain ride at DisneyWorld and made it so much better. For starters, double the riders with a 2 by 2 by 2 car format helps move things along. Also, a longer ride with better special effects breathes fresh air into this ""tired"" U.S. ride.

Most of the other attractions are pretty similar to the U.S. Disney Parks; however, I will say the Tokyo parades are fantastic and seem to occur every couple of hours. The parade routes are long and the energy is sky-high.

One of the Tokyo magical moment is their Parade, a MUST see for all visitor as Tokyo Disneyland Parade is really magical, entertaining , far more enjoyable than other Disneyland which I had visited.

Regard the ticket , unless there some discount online, or else dont even bother to buy online ticket, get them from Disney Store the day before or even earlier.. If that is not desirable just get them from ticket booth.

But there are days where the park is full, they will not sell you one at the ticket booth. All disney ticket is dated, even if you buy multiple day ticket, you need to specific days & date you going to Disneysea or Disneyland prior

So if you at Disney Store to get tickets for tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, then you will have a guarantee entrance to avoid disappointment

Back to disney, well.. don't worry about food, Disney Tokyo has a great range of food available, especially the turkey leg.. that is really delicious. Beside restaurant, a handful of food counter and stall is well located across the park.

Do not miss out their souvenir shop, they got huge selection of merchandise where you hardly will find in other Disney store.

We stay will the end of park operation hour after enjoying the spectacular firework show and magical projection show. Both my kids enjoy the show alot, especially the night parade, is really brilliant light show.

I love Disneyland Tokyo, absolutely recommend for everyone to visit here. Come and experience yourself !","Written October 4, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1002,An a-okay place to be :),"Disneyland is great for young children and young teens under the age of 16 :) the rides were very G - PG rated and it's more of a park where you explore the makings of Walt Disney, Disney movies and characters. We went at the beginning of Autumn and it was actually so hot! The prices of food inside the park were decent and affordable. The curry sold at the hungry bear restaurant is really nice so this place is nice to eat at in the park for an early dinner. There were a couple thrilling rides such as Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and the pirates of the Caribbean ride :) the views are incredible on each ride! It's like you're actually in another world! Oh and the waiting times for each ride were so much faster than other parks! The waiting times at Disneyland were pretty fast moving and the most that you would ever have to wait for a ride would be 1 hour or just over. The lines continuously move and the wait is worth it because whatever ride you go on in the end has amazing views I'm sure :)","Written October 3, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1003,Love disneyland!,"I am an avid disney fan so this was a must see during my stay in japan. We did this disney park after having done the disney park in America. Obviously it is smaller, and most of the rides are in japanese. However, this did not bother us we had done the rides in the American disney. It still has the classics such as peter pan, snow white, madhatter teacups, and small world attraction. The longest we waited was 30 minutes for a ride. There where two parades during the day and light the night one at night time which was awesome. We left the park for dinner, as across the park there is a food court which was well priced. Inside the castle is a cinderella ballroom which is beautiful, and there are many beautiful statues around the park. There are fireworks and a light show on the castle at night too. The park is easy to get too via train, the attendants at the train station where very helpful when we asked for the disneyland stop. Highly recommend this park!","Written October 3, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1004,Tokyo Disneyland is Great with various points explained,"Summary : Tokyo Disneyland is Great , so no doubt about it , you must definitely visit

It is difficult to explain everything in this small review but I would try to summarize below, pls give THUMBS UP on it if it helps ...

1. Do your research first before visiting
2. Buy cheap tickets ahead (no discount at the park) and check weather forecast
3. Reach early ( 7 - 8 am ), and better to stay in nearby hotels ( there are many )
4. Each Parks must be visited for 2 days to enjoy completely
5. Disney SEA is slightly better than Disneyland ( at least I felt that )
6. June is a great time to visit, we went in June and it was SUNNY & yet GREAT weather
7. No point buying Mickey Glass, T-Shirts on high price on the Park, you can buy those at cheap price ahead of your visit
8. DEFINITELY try to make use of FASTPASS as much as possible, without that you will be in long queue

Let me know if this helps, let me know if you have any questions and pls give THUMBS UP on it if you like it.

Thanks

1005,Amazing fun for the whole family here!,"It was really cold when we went in late Autumn, but light on crowds so the longest wait time was less than one hour. Hubby and I and the kids all had an awesome time here and stayed for the night lights parade. Definitely worth the wait - even the Disney princess dresses were lit up!
Most of the attractions were open and you can take a ticket and come back later on selected rides to save wait time.
We were disappointed not to see the Fairytale castle open, but everything else was available. Space Mtn, Pooh Bear rides and the classic tea-cup and It's a Small Wall rides were good. Not as expensive as we'd expected either.","Written October 2, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

It is more geared towards small children, which is expected, but it didn‚Äôt seem to have the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô I imagined it would. Disney Resort looks more magical than the park itself!

1008,A great day out for the family,"We spent a day at Disneyland with two couples, two 5 year olds, a 3 year old and 10 month old. I think that was enough time to see what we wanted to.

There are rides and activities for all ages. To get the most out of the rides, you need to be over 102cm.

Make sure you get there at least half an hour before opening time and pre- purchase tickets online. Make sure you know which rides are a must and go directly to them when the park opens. Otherwise you may miss out or find yourself in a queue of over an hour.

They have a fast pass system that I would read up on before you go as it seems to change regularly (based on what people who had been before have told me).

There was plenty of food on offer with some particularly interesting popcorn flavours including curry!

The nighttime parade was fantastic and a must see. The floats were incredible!

For people with young kids, you can hire a stroller for 100 Yen (about $11 Australian). I would recommend you do as there is a lot of walking to be done.

Definitely a great place for people of all ages.","Written September 30, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1010,Magical Place,"This was our last Disney we needed to visit worldwide and well we saved the best for last.

Yet another magical place, where at any age you feel like the child inside you again comes alive.

This Disney is so well organised, nothing feels stressed or rushed, people queue in an orderly fashion and there is no pushing or screaming kids anywhere.

We were lucky enough to attend at the time of year when public are allowed to dress up as characters and well this just made the whole day even more magical. Some were dressed even better than the real characters.

The parades were the best we have ever seen and again so well organised. Everyone is made to take a spot, but no one can stand up in front of someone, you can't block people's views, you can't overcrowd an area, it was just magical and the organisation made the whole event better.

Now there were some queues and some were an hour long, and this was on what was one of the quietest days of the year, but get there early run round like a mad man and do what you want to do and then enjoy the rest of the day at your leisure.

1012,Disneyland = Dreamland for everyone,"Its everyone's dream to visit Disneyland. I went two years ago during winter. Be prepared with lots of warm clothings, drinks and snacks. Food is extremely limited and expensive. Long queue for rides that are popular. Try to get Fasttrack or Express coupons when they make announcements over the PA System so that you do not have to wait long for your turn to take the rides. Most popular place among tourists are the souvenir shops. Most popular items to get are the Disney characters for the popcorn holders. Different areas sell different Disney characters.

1014,A good day out.,"I have been to Euro Disney and this is somewhat smaller. For me the disappointment was that two big rides, Thunder Mountain which I was looking forward to and a Small, small world which I wanted to go on for nostalgic reasons, were both closed for refurbishment. This wasn't mentioned on the website and not even when you enter the park. It rained for a lot of the day, although Disney can't be held responsible for the weather they didn't deal with it very well, cancelling a parade and a show because of it...having come to Tokyo many times over the years I know it rains! Overall though, we had an enjoyable day. The food and drink was not overpriced as it can be in theme parks and they did sell umbrellas üåÇ at a reasonable price!","Written September 24, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1015,Tokyo Disneyland,"Awesome time, purchased a package deal through ITT travel in Okinawa. Spent one day at Tokoyo Disney with 7 and 10 year olds. No problems getting on rides with either of them. Good english speaking staff and ride wait times were not outrageous as expected. Max ride wait was 20 mins for the newer attractions. Popcorn of different varieties is for sale throughout the park, each stall sells a specific popcorn bucket for $25. Pick the one you want before you go and buy that first. Good snack for kids while trying to choose between restaurants. Bucket refills are only $5 or 500 yen. Downside was that there was not enough drink vendors and water is a hot commodity. I suggest loading the backpack with enough water bottles for everyone in the family to have one and refilling them at the drinking fountains. The restaurants only sell one type of food which is bad with two picky eaters. We never did decide what we wanted to eat so we snacked the whole first day. Plan meals ahead using the map on the Disney website. The shops were priced as expected of Disney but you don't choose Disney as a vacation without planning to drop some money. Overall it was a wonderful trip, I can't wait to go back.","Written September 24, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1016,Loved the parades,"Had a wonderful day here in mid September. We deliberately chose a midweek day to come to avoid weekend crowds and we weren't disappointed.
We arrived 45 mins before the gates opened and we managed to get on everything we wanted to do in a day using fastpasses. We saw all three of the parades and the show in Tomorrowland too. For any Disney fan this place is a must, the merchandise alone makes it worth to visit. There is something unique in almost half the shops so if you love souvenir shopping then this is ideal, but do it early, there will be frenzied biscuit buying at the end of the day.
I've noted a few times in reviews that people complain about the lack of English and difficulty in communicating. However I found that we had no problems at all, there are pictures to point at and you/cast members usually get the gist of the conversation. Just be polite, the cast will do everything they can to help you and when they can't they will go and get someone who can speak English.

1021,Finally visited Tokyo Disney,"Tokyo Disneyland in my honest opinion is a bit old..you can see it in the looks of some of the rides and unfortunately a few of the rides were also closed for renovation at the time of my visit, not to mention the scorching hot summer weather and oh so crowded visitors everywhere with long queues in almost every ride, together with unusual (at least for me) lottery system to get a ticket for the musical show. It all made my visit somehow less impressive than what I had previously expected.
But after all it is still Disneyland, and you can't help feeling happy and amazed going there. Star Wars 4d ride there was great and they did great job with the parades (I watched all 3 parades of the day:Tanabata parade, mid-Day Parade, Night Lights Parade).
They have a few restaurants with different themes, as well as snacks stall with yummy popcorn and ice cream too..
Oh and the Cinderella grand castle is indeed majestic and magnificent, the way it was lit up at night time along with projection fireworks show is also something you should not miss!
All in all still a great day out at Disneyland Tokyo, but for more sophisticated rides, less tiring walk around the theme park, shorter queue time for each rides, and easy access to the musical shows, you might as well consider going to Hongkong Disneyland.","Written September 17, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

I will give you all one tip i picked up - be there as early as possible. stand in line (if you are not staying in Disney Resort), be ready to buy your ticket and then...run :) before you even go there research attractions you want to visit. For some of them you can take fast tract tickets, for some you need to take part in lottery to get in.

Tips: check the crowd prediction websites and go on a weekday and choose a day with low crowds (this is probably what helped us to get on so many rides so quickly by choosing a day with low predicted crowds); buy a ticket in advance (saves you time in lines if you already have your ticket); use the fastpass system for Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Pooh's Honey Hunt & Buzz Lightyear; watch the Happiness Parade it's sensational; try the different flavoured popcorns for sale throughout the park; if you're going to eat dinner at the Queen's Banquet Hall go early (we went in at about 5:30pm) to try miss the mega queue.

Make sure to have a fastpass and rides app to try to skip the 300min lines as they can really exhaust and damage a trip.

I would suggest picking out two or three best rides and where a fast pass is available, go straight to the fast pass ticket counters asap. We got there a bit later hoping to avoid the early crowds, worked well to get in but the fast pass times were very late, after 8pm or gone altogether. We stayed until 5, then got a pass out and walked about 10 minutes to Iksbiari shopping centre where we had dinner at TGI Fridays, then returned to Disneyland for night light parade and some more rides. Ride times were quite a bit less after the parade. The night parade is by far the best parade due to the spectacular lighting.

1037,Super busy (during Matsuri season) and rainy but still beautiful!,"How do I rate this? 4 stars or 5? It almost seems a crime scoring a Disney park less than 5 stars. It's beautiful, it's magical, it's Disney!

To be as fair as I can be, here are the facts:

1.) This was not my first Disney experience.
2.) We did not stay on property (too expensive! More on this later)
3.) It was super busy (as mentioned, this was during Summer break so families flooded it
4.) Super rainy

I tried to ignore these factors when assigning my rating but I'm sure they impacted my experience and therefore I have to acknowledge that it is entirely possible that if even one of these factors were different, this might have ended up a 5 star review.

Having stated that, four stars is nothing to sneeze at. And having been to Walt Disney World - perhaps nowadays the definitive Disney experience - during a non busy time of year with nearly perfect weather the entire trip, it's fair to say that I am holding Tokyo Disneyland to a VERY high standard.

The pros:

- Park tickets (""passports"") themselves are relatively inexpensive. We got 2 day passports for I think about $120 each. Not bad, that might be a single day at WDW.
- This has all the charm of the Magic Kingdom, it's a true Disney experience with all the parades, shows, fireworks, magic and of course...
- The ""attractions"" (I still like to call them ""rides"", even if that makes it sound like a rusty travelling carnival) --> we made sure to hop on all of the exclusive ones that are only available in Tokyo - Pooh's Hunny Hunt was AMAZING, easily my favourite ride. The Roger Rabbit ""Toontown Spin"" ride is also quite cool, and the Monsters Inc Ride and Go Seek was a lot of fun as well. We also got to check out the Japanese version of the Haunted Mansion - it's still my all-time favourite Disney attraction ever.
- Even with the huge crowds, getting food was pretty quick. There were lines, but they all seemed to move rapidly. Chalk it up to Japanese efficiency and work ethic, I suppose?
- Theming is up to Disney standards. Still the best reason to choose Disney over, say, Universal Studios. The Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall, for instance, in spite of being something of a cafeteria in terms of both service and food, really does make you feel like you're in Wonderland. This alone is worth the wait and money.

Cons:
- As mentioned above, the resorts are CRAZY expensive. I guess it's because they have fewer hotels and fewer rooms in Tokyo than say, Orlando. Also luxury accommodations in Tokyo seem to be pricey in general, so it could just be a continuation of this trend. Finally, it was during the Summer/Matsuri season, so perhaps you'll have better luck. We had an hour and two train rides (and maybe a can ride if the rain was bad enough or our feet hurt too much) separating us from our hotel at the end of the night. So, like any other Disney park: If you can swing it, stay on property. It was just too pricey for us. This time.
- Lines, lines, LINES! And crowds. Okay, so again, we went at probably the worst possible time. Ankle biters everywhere. Also, the nihonjin seem to have this weird thing where they don't course correct for ANYONE, so they would apparently rather collide with you than to do what we in the states do, where both parties shift slightly to make room for the other. So expect to be bumped into a few times and to have to abruptly stop as children run directly in front of you (parenting in Japan is similar to 1980s America - which I think is a good thing, really) but honestly, it's Disney. We expect children. Goes with the territory. Learn from my mistake - don't go during Matsuri season.
- NO FASTPASS + (this makes me so sad): I have never had to deal with the oldschool, paper fastpass system before. It was... less than optimal. At least we got to use a fastpass (for Haunted Mansion) but after using FP+ at WDW, this felt like a huge step backwards.
- Honestly... that's about it. As I said, I almost rated this a 5 star experience, so you know this was good! It's Disney, it's iconic, it's fantastic, it's fun. Go and have fun!","Written September 1, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

1041,"Two amazing days, could of stayed 20!","Absolutely loved visiting Disneyland! Magical from the moment you stepped off the train at Maihama station. A Disney lovers dream, but also highly enjoyed by the less fanatic.
Can be crowded with waits up to 2 hours for some rides, but utilising the fast pass system helped ease this.

My favourite place in the world!","Written August 29, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1042,Happiest place on (Japanese) earth!,"The Disney magic works just about anywhere. It's about 45 minutes by subway from the Shinjuku station to the Maihama station. We went on a weekday and the place is packed. If you're short on time, you can get an After 6 pass for 4200 yen (1 Day pass is 7400 yen). The Japanese really get into the Disney spirit. You can see groups of people wearing matching Disney and non-Disney attires, including kimonos. There is a little bit of language barrier. It's weird to hear Mickey and the other characters speaking Japanese, but still entertaining though. I give it a 4.5/5 because the evening fireworks were canceled on the day we went.","Written August 28, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1043,Magical experience for all.,"Disneyland Tokyo was lovely and the people who work there really help make the experience better. They are very kind and try their best to accommodate for everyone of different age, size and race. The light show at the end has got to be one of the best parts of the day by far. I would highly recommend staying until the show starts.

The only downfall to the experience would be the extremely long queues. My sister, my boyfriend and myself waited in line for Big Thunder Mountain for two hours and it we were all uncomfortable due to the heat. However, if you're well prepared with food and drink then the day should be grand!","Written August 28, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

We all had such a great day and managed to ride all of the rides at least once or twice.We also enjoyed all of the shows even though they were in Japanese!

1046,One of our favourite days in Japan!,"The last time I visited any Disney resort was in the early 00's when I was only 5. I don't remember a lot so I persuaded my parents to come here so I could relive a lot of the experiences in those photographs that I wish I could remember. I was almost 18 this time, and this park did not disappoint me. We had such a fun day despite queues for the bigger rides being over an hour long. We actually took time to go on some smaller rides which were just as fun (Rodger Rabbits cartoon Spin was one of my highlights!) All of the other rides were great and my whole family enjoyed them. We didn't miss a parade either, and they were all brilliant too! Especially the beginning one - we didn't know we would get drenched in water but it was welcomed in the Tokyo summer heat (34C!)

The food was lovely- we ate in the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall which was beautifully decorated, however, I would recommend going to eat there just after dinner as we went right at dinner time and had to queue for a long time, but it was worth it!

Everything at the park is done perfectly, none of the rides or decorations that we saw were under par. The staff are all incredibly friendly and welcoming.

The park is so big, we only got to spend one day there but I would spend two! This park provides whatever you want out of it, whether that's small rides, bigger rides, parades, meet and greets, it really has it all! And I love it.","Written August 24, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1047,Don't do it!,"My wife and I have visited all of the Disneyland parks in Southeast Asia (and Disney World in Orlando) and Tokyo Disneyland is by far the worst. If I were to put the Southeast Asia Disney parks in order of precedence, it would be Shanghai Disney in China, then Hong Kong Disney, then any other amusement park anywhere else, and then Tokyo Disney. All three of the good rides have 90 to 130 minute wait times and they are dulled down versions of the originals at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. The restaurants in the park serve food that tastes like it was straight out of primary school lunches in the 1990's. If you are going to buy souvenirs, be prepared to pay three times what you would pay in the United States for the same item. We truly love Disney Parks but Tokyo Disney is a complete disappointment.","Written August 22, 2017",1.0 of 5 bubbles

1052,Among the best Disneyland parks in the world,"This was our 4th visit to a Disneyland park after Los Angeles,Hong Kong & Paris. More or less the same layout for every park, but Tokyo Disneyland must have got the most accommodating staffs despite the language barrier. Every one of them was so friendly and helpful that any request ( as simple as asking for the guide book) would be met instantly. There was not even a 'no' answer. The only spoilers were a few Japanese ladies in kimonos who rudely asked for money when we asked to have them photographed with us. Not sure whether it's the park's policy though as I thought those wearing kimonos are only entitled to a discount on park entrance fees. All in all, we really enjoyed our time there even though it was a rainy season and a rather wet Disneyland visit.","Written August 13, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The Japanese people are very into Disney making it very fun. We never waited for more than 30 minutes on any ride and they have fast passes. They have great parades and awesome shopping for gifts. The food caters to the Japanese taste but Western food is available. There are many of the classic rides and it is amazing to see it in Japanese!!

And start at toon town and Mickey Mouse's house if you have small kids as small kids tend to get tired and fall asleep after a couple of rides.

We we're disappointed with the characters hardly any and when you did see them they weren't interested in having photos with you almost ignored you if you were an adult the merchandise not even one Tshirt with 2017 on it actually almost nothing with 2017 lots of tin sweets and cookies

We used a fast pass for splash mountain so waited no longer than 20 mins for a ride, with some being only 5 to 10mins. We did stop for the occasionally snack which were not too over priced.

We were able to go on all the rides that we didn't queue 2 hours for in other parks. It was great. The atmosphere was lovely. The cast members were friendly and helpful.

I loved the way the cast members asked everyone to sit down for the parades so that everyone could see it. Every Disney park should do the same so that it's fair for all to see. I've been in Disney Parks before in which adults push kids aside so that they can see. Tokyo Disneyland allowed everyone a chance to see everything no matter how tall or small you are. It would have been nice if the park stayed open for longer (up to midnight) The night time show was on very early and there were few fireworks. It didn't have the same spectacular feel that you get at the Disneyworld light show and fireworks.
Overall, we loved our time there and we would certainly return and recommend it to others.","Written August 4, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

You will waste your time queueing, unless you have the Fastpass ticket which is sold at additional cost.","Written August 3, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1069,Wonderful Time,"I love Disneyland! I like Tokyo Disneyland better than the park in Anaheim. The cost of admission was much cheaper than in CA (7400 yen, around $68). My daughter paid $125 a few weeks ago. Everything is cheaper here. A large coke was 300 yen (less than $3) and the pizza spring rolls (really yummy) were 270 yen.

The rides are a little different than their California counterparts. Space Mountain was better. Peter Pan not as good. No Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. They still have the Spacejets (rockets in Tomorrowland). Some of the CA Disneyland rides like Indiana Jones are in Disney Sea.

The Electrical Parade was awesome. The Queen of Hearts Dining Hall was neat but a little higher priced...stick to the desserts.

Popcorn seems to be a big deal here. It's a bit pricey if you buy a character container (about 2100 yen) but you can refill it for 510 yen both here and Disney Sea. They have more than five varieties...shoyu butter and curry were the best.

Attractions they don't have in CA are not to be missed. Mickey's Philharmagic is a 3D musical show that was really good (and it felt good to sit down in an air-conditioned theater). Pooh's Hunny Hunt was awesome. Monster's Inc. Ride N Go Seek was good.

Just a hint...ride Space Mountain and Splash Mountain as a single rider. Just walk up to the fastpass line and hold up one finger (preferably your index finger and not the middle one) and you don't have to wait. When we went, the standby line for Splash Mountain was 130 minutes...we were on in 10. We rode multiple times. The standby line for Space Mountain was 100 minutes, we were on in 5. You don't get to ride with your friends/family, but we don't talk on the rides anyway.

It's a Small World was closed.

Pales a bit in comparison to its neighbor DisneySea, but great if you have a small kids. The cast members are enthusiastic and friendly and go out of their way to help even when there's a language barrier. It was very easy to get in the park (very efficient security and ticket checks) and the price is very reasonable especially in comparison to US parks.

The food is fantastic. Loved the chocolate and caramel popcorns and came home with an awesome BB8 popcorn holder. The chicken waffle sandwiches are fantastic - you get those at Camp Woodchuck. Lots of funky snacks and things that are worth trying.

We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and got the Happy 15 early entry which enabled us to ride a couple extra things during the day. Very worth it. The parades especially the electric parade are great.

The rides are the usual Disney assortment with a few unique ones thrown in. Pooh's Honey Hunt was great but was broken a lot of the day so we could only ride it once. Monsters Inc we found to be overrated, really nothing special. But the usual rides like Haunted Mansion, Pirates, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder, etc, were all wonderfully themed and fun. Lines were manageable in the middle of the week but fast passes helped a lot. Very sadly both Space Mountain and Small World were closed during our visit. Boo. Also the fireworks were cancelled when we were there due to ""high winds"" but the winds were pretty light. Disappointing.

1075,Classic Disney,"This park is classic Disney. Growing up in S Florida I'm a 3-4 times per year Disney World visitor. Tokyo Disney Land felt like Disney World back in the 90s (and it's not a bad thing). They have rides here that have long been removed from Disney World. The parks seems to be more spread out vs Disney World which gives the sense of it being leas crowded. But then you try to get on the more popular rides and you are reminded that you are at a Disney park. As an international traver it was a bit of a challenge to find food for my kids. They are a bit picky, and traveling internationally doesn't help. One thing i wasn't used to was having to pay to ride the monorail. You can get a one way ticket or an all day pass. Having to pay to ride the monorail really left a bad taste. We stayed at the Sheraton Grande which is on property and the monorail station is right in front of hotel. i dont know why, but there is a Disney shuttle that takes you from the station to the hotel. it didn't really make sense to me since the station is literally across the street. Although the bus is really Disney-decorated so i guess you have to ride it once.
I also was not very impressed with the .merchandise offered at the various shops. The one thing that bothered me was the stores did not remain opened much longer after park closed. Disney World in Orlando will keep stores on Main Street opened a significant amount of time after the park closes. They want to ensure they get as much money out of you as possible.
Last thing that i disliked was the covered structure over Main Street. It just takes away from the feel of Main Street. i understand it is to protect guests from the elements, i just didn't like the look and feel.
Bottom line, if you are a Disney fan you dont want to miss going to Tokyo Disney if you are in Tokyo.","Written July 26, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

It was everything I expected, except the prices. the food and drink prices were amazingly cheap as was the merchandise. I was totally blown away by the cheapness of everything. we went on a weekday where the crowds are less, however this didn't stop the lines for the rides. You can get a fast pass and basically book a time so you don't have to wait in line.
We went with out children and still had a good time, but I think the magic of Disney is for those of a younger age and would be a memory your children would keep forever, its a big day but is totally worth it.","Written July 25, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1078,No complaints on price - it is worth it - everyone will love it!,"With good access by metro train or by using buses from different locations, one could comfortably reach Disney Land. We went in May and hence Easter attractions were addition and they were very colorful. (Winne the) Pooh hunt, Monsters Inc,, Haunted Mansion were few of the key attractions that we went and used Fast Pass for two of them. Pooh hunt wait for us (without Fast Pass) in the queue is little more than 2 hours. Pirates of the Caribbean set was amazing - our travelling boat looks like miniature next to a gigantic ship setting. We went a lot of rides and my kids enjoyed them thoroughly. Small world attraction was closed when we went, but the Usatama song in the parade was similarly catchy and nostalgic. I have been to Disney World Fforida, Disney Land Los Angeles and Disney Land Paris earlier - Tokyo one was equivalently great. One thing I noted is lot of locals here against what we experienced in other places - rarely we seen foreigners like us when we went, this is not a complaint but just an observation. Souvenirs sold are expensive as expected, but no complaints. Enchanted Tikki show is lovely and the commentary by a host there was interesting. Different flavored popcorns are available and everyone make effort to eat as many flavors as possible. At the end in the night, grand finale of million LEDs parade, light shows and fire works are absolutely stunning.

It is fun to see not only the park itself, but also the visitors. Japanese definitely know how to do cosplay! Watching the young-Japanese visitor is half the fun of this place.

Anyway, whoever responsible to run this place, should be proud to themselves. Everyone did an amazing job. Almost cry when i have to go home..","Written July 21, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1082,Wonderful place to be!!!!! Worth the money,It is a wonderful place to be. Kids enjoy it a lot. Many rides for both adults and kids. Enjoyed the rides with kids. Monsters inc. Star Wars. Space mountain. Buzz light year critter city fantasy land(was closed for maintenance) cinderellas castle too much to write but best to experience it yourself. Worth the money spent. Trick bring your own food and water for at least half a day. If you r visiting Muslim family try to bring your own food for whole day. It gets very crowded and waiting time for rides can be as long as 70mins or more. Try to check online before you go to choose appropriate day by looking at crowd calendar anything under 50 should be good. Try to choose your rides if you are specific about them. You can choose the fast pass option avaialable per ticket every 2 hours only. Overall great place to visit full of fun activities.

1083,Definately worth it,"We made the mistake of doing a full day at Disneysea and were bored by 1pm. Disneyland we did a twilight pass and it was a much better park for us with more to do. The splash mountain rides was fun and space mountain plus thunder mountain and we did the pirates ride which was more of a float down the stream of a movie set - the scenes were very good though. The show was amazing and the park is well kept. Most vendors close stores just after the show and we were bit slow to get some themed items, so shop just before the show for popcorn and drink buckets etc. We didn't want to drag them along and had intended to get them at the end but it was too late. The twilight pass was good and we got in quite a few rides. Easy to get to on trains and imagine our surprise we had rush hour on the train from tokyo station back to hotel at 11pm on a weekday!

1086,Enjoyed every second,"The moment you step through the turnstile, you already feel it, the atmosphere is just so... fun. Disney characters are taking pictures, and nothing changes once you go inside. Tip: Head left to Adventureland, because most people go right. While you're there at that side of the park, don't miss Jungle Cruise. It's probably the best one (with the best skipper) I've ever ridden. If you don't understand Japanese, don't worry, the gestures tell you everything you need to know. Then head clockwise, towards Fantasyland. The kids will have major fun here, and usually some short-line steals are Peter Pan's Flight and the PhilharMagic show. Don't forget to nab fastpasses for Splash Mountain and Pooh's Hunny Hunt, as those are in that area. A pleasant surprise in this Disneyland was that you could actually go inside the iconic castle, and this one has a walkthrough Cinderella-themed art exhibit. Then last but not least, Tomorrowland. A lot of good rides are located in one complex there (Space Mountain, Monster's Inc.) and there's a stretch of walkway there with snack carts left and right, and one of my personal favorites is the flavored churro :) You can get one in many places around both parks, but the flavor depends on where you are. We were there at dusk, and I loved seeing all the lights turn on :> After dark, do not miss the Once Upon A Time show projected on the castle. The montage of Disney films (set to gorgeous music) is the magical cherry on top of a tiring day, making you forget how much your feet hurt at the time. It just shows you the perennial charming quality of Disneyland that makes it worth going back to, a little pocket of timeless magic in our ever-changing world :)","Written July 14, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

At the end of the day, our mission accomplished, we able to play all the games that we wish to play except we gave up the thunder mountain the night parade.

Upon entering the park, warm welcome was given by all the staffs and everyone inside the park is feeling joyful and happy. Make sure you got the leaflet & map from the staffs so that you know what time is the parade will start and the location of the games.

1094,More then just one day,"This would be the 10th time we have been to Disneyland everytime we come there is always something a little different that keeps the magic alive . Our kids stay awake some how to 10 at night for all 3 days . We spend 2 days a Disneyland and one at Disney sea. Disneyland is more shows and rides for smaller kids with meeting spots all around and a great light and fireworks show at the end of the night . Can always find something to eat or sit down. I found everything and everyone was english friendly so had no problems. If kids like mickey mouse the toontown is a must . Go to mickey mouses house and you get a video and photo with mickey in his house . Always a line up but as normal everything seems to run smoothly. A note if you or child has birthday in or around that time tell staff and ask for sticker. Every staff that see that sticker will wish happy birthday and some even give little sticker gifts . Then you cant wipe smile of your little ones faces.
We spend one day doing shows and one day doing rides. And pictures in between. Use fast passes wisely can get every 2 hours woryh the line up to get means you can plan your day. And one mans dream is a special ticket show where you have to win tickets ro see. There is a area in tomorrowland that yuou go to see if you win tickets. Not many visitors get the chance to do . All in japanese but the show is easy to understand . Just remember if you go just enjoy yourself . Disneyland has everything else. 5 stars

1095,Amazing!,"We got the 4 day pass for Disneyland and Disneysea and I would definitely recommend this! We spent the first 2 days at Disneyland and the second two at Disneysea, heading back to Disneyland for the last few hours of our last day.

This was our first visit to a Disneyland and we were not disappointed. We took our 9 and 11 year old daughters and we had just as much fun as they did. Our 11 year old is not a thrill seeker at all (neither are my husband and I) but really enjoyed all the rides at Disneyland. Splash Mountain was a bit of a push initially but she ended up doing it 3 times and she absolutely loved Big Thunder Mountain. The drop on Splash Mountain is pretty steep but isn't as bad as it looks. This ride is amazing on the inside and lasts about 8 minutes - really worth it! The majority of the rides are aimed at children so there is nothing too scary.

The Disney fast pass system is fantastic! You don't need to pay any extra but are only allowed a fast pass about every couple of hours. After the first day, you get this system pretty well sorted. We went straight to the ride we wanted a fast pass for. The fast pass machines are normally by the ride queue. The ticket tells you the hour time slot to come back in and you could go and enjoy the other rides. The fast pass ticket also tells you the time you can get another fast pass so we just made sure we always had a new ticket when we were allowed one. They are only available on the most popular rides but really are worth it as it cuts the line time considerably.

The morning parade was ok but the afternoon and evening parade as well as 'Once upon a time' are not to be missed - just breathtaking. I was blown away by 'Once upon a time' as they project the story images onto the castle - amazing! After you have seen the parades once, on the next day, these times are the best to get short queues in the rides as most other people are at the parades.

We were pleasantly surprised by the cost of food. There is a huge range of options and for a theme park, they are really reasonably priced.

Because the main purpose of our trip was Disneyland, we stayed at an airbnb in Urayasu. This was perfect as we just got a bus 5 minutes up the road to Disneyland for 150 yen. We were also able to easily navigate the bus and train system to get to other areas of Tokyo (with the help of Google Maps). We flew into Narita airport which is about an hour from the city!! Next time we would fly into Haneda. However it wasn't too bad. We got the airport limousine bus to Urayasu and then the Narita Express train from the Tokyo station back as we were leaving early in the morning and the Limousine bus hadn't started yet. I downloaded the Tokyo Taxi app to get us to the ShinUrayasu train station at 5am that morning. I checked this worked when we were in Tokyo city a few days before and it was fine. When I went to use it that morning it told me I was out of range for the app!! Eek! So Uber it was, however, the Uber driver had to come from the other side of Tokyo so it took him half an hour to get to us. We were cutting it fine but made it in the end.

Overall, we were blown away by Disneyland and had a fantastic time!","Written July 5, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We went on a weekday and the park was crowded but the wait times were still very reasonable. We were able to ride most everything in 6 hours. The park is exceptionally clean and everyone was friendly. We anticipated a language barrier but most everything we needed we could communicate or the cast member spoke English.

Although I started panicking expecting long lines at every attraction, things ended up going very smoothly mainly thanks to the very professional and efficient staff (This makes a big difference to other Disney Parks). Long lines were indeed a fast transit , never went beyond 30 min, most were 20 min avg. Only two downsides were the total lack of Wi-Fi and the fact that Fast-Pass is actually a system that makes you acquire a ticket to enter the line several hrs later. Say, you get it at the machine at midday and you can ride at 1800. Tends to be a closing times.... some fast pass lines were longer than the standard! not a lot of sense on this. In any case, food was great, all attractions were very good, except for the space ride closed.......... this seems to be a doomed attraction though, is always shut off.

It was pretty nice. We had to wait a long time to get on rides. Splash mountain was my favourite ride. We had to wait about 2 hours and I got tired, bored and hungry by waiting.
Some rides were painful because I moved too much in the seat, like space mountain.
Donald Duck tried to hug me, which I didn't really want. I felt like punching him because he got too aggressive by trying to hug me.

What's not good

Too many shops make it feel like a mall. There are few rides which are clearly for children below 5. Need to put some rating. Built in 1983, the park does seem old and little out of date but then it's Disneyland.

1112,"Exhorbitant Charges, Trying Experience - If You Can't Communicate in Japanese","The visuals attract. The fairytale castle, the quaint period buildings housing shops and diners, the costumed crew, the themed coaches, the delightful Parades, the unique rides.

In general, the hardware pleases.

The software - the human touch, failed miserably. I felt this. My take is that Tokyo Disneyland is meant for Jap speakers specifically.

There was an obvious lack of roving Disney characters for photo ops. My entire day there only sighted Goofy & Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. Both acts were chaperoned by crew members who, without exception, set up photo ops for Jap speaking visitors.

I needed paracetamol tablets. I approached 5 crew members gathered at the water cooler shed, next to the First Aid cross signage. I showed them the box I had bought in Tokyo. They chorused "" Sorry"" with clenched fisted arms crossed ""x"" before their chests. I pointed to my head, said ""pain"", and pointed to the First Aid cross signage. All I got were crossed arms, although with beaming smiles - which I registered as fake.

I rested at the same shed. Near Parade time, the crew chased me out. No one was allowed in the shed except those who need to drink water from the cooler .. and then go. I complied, hobbling on my walking stick to stand behind the shed, in the hot sun.

Just before the Parade started, the rope barrier was released and a group of Japanese visitors were allowed to sit where I was chased away. Not good.

I asked how long to queue to do the Pirates of the Carribean ride. 20 minutes, I was told. And how long will the ride take? 20 minutes. I was told again. I don't think they understood me.

After queuing for 30 mins, I was ready to board the boat. I signaled to the crew manning the admission that I was travelling alone, with my walking stick. She waved me on to queue no 4. I struggled onto the boat. No help was offered or rendered.

Having settled in, 2 crew members came and gestured me to move to the boat at the back. There was no finesse or politeness in their communication. I lifted my walking stick to show them moving is an issue for me.

Regardless, they continued their Japanese jabbering. Embarrassed and upset, I struggled out of the boat. Again, no help was offered or rendered. The crew didnt bother to help me to the alternate boat. When I left the ride area, none the crew cared. The smiles weren't there anymore. Also, no smiles showed on me. For Sure! Yes, I forgo the ride after the lengthy queuing. There was definitely no Disney mood to be had.

Look closely at some pics I have attached. Benches meant for 5 to 6 to sit were occupied by lesser numbers... with bags etc taking up the empty spaces. Crew members aren't monitoring this enough. In the heat of the day, there is no shaded area set up for the infirm, the very old or very young.

My experience is that Disneyland Tokyo need to be more humane. I am wishing upon a star for that to happen.","Written June 22, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1113,Great Time,Our family really enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland. Going during the week was a great idea. The park was not as congested. We rode a majority of the rides and watched the parade with ease. Did everything in one day. Great family day.,"Written June 20, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1114,Over-hyped & Over-crowded,"Star Tours - the Star Wars themed building makes the 45 minute queue more bearable and the 5 minute ride itself was allot of fun. A second viewing around 6pm the queue was about 20 minutes long (online, the queue was apparently 5 minutes long) and I noticed some differences in the second movie showing - no spoilers. This was mine and my older boy's favorite ride.

The movie Theater was also enjoyable with the cinnamon smells, water splashes and curved-screen 3D.

Small-World was closed and the queues for Splash-mountain were so long the entire day we didn't even bother.

Nasa rockets, dumbo and tea-cups were fun but far too short-lived. These are basic (but still fun) rides which probably would have no queues somewhere like Drayton Manor or Alton Towers.

The Roger-Rabbit ride lasted a bit longer but the ride itself was a very disappointment experience.

Got the fast-pass at 9am and the earliest time for use was 7.10pm.

The adventure island is fun for small children - especially the rock and tree-house. I would advise a picnic lunch and eat it on this island since there was hardly any people there and there.

The fast-food is terrible, but the ice-lollies, pop-corn and drinks are OK. Bring a tooth-brush.

The toilets and park in general was exceptionally clean. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly, but there are too many rules on do's and don'ts and directing traffic, waiting lines, no-go areas, etc... you start getting annoyed at the staff anyway.

Having been to many theme-parks in my life, I can say without doubt the queuing for the nicely themed rides vs the reward and time spent on those rides is the lowest I've ever encountered.

Tokyo Dome is more fun than this place. Ueno zoo is more fun for kids and adults than this place.

The prices for tickets, parking, food etc... is too high for what you get. Your paying for the brand and a ""themed"" experience, where you will spend almost the entire time queuing for what amounts to children's rides you can find better at Gypsy fairs on bonfire night with less queuing and cheaper prices.

Disney seem to own or control the entire island so no visible convenience stores, restaurants or drink machines outside of the park like you see everywhere throughout the rest of Tokyo.

Perhaps the American and French Disney theme parks are better! Adverts in Disney films and TV would have you believe there are people dressed-up as Disney characters everywhere in the park. (It would be a nice touch if they entertained the kids along the queues). That's not the case, but there are a few photo-opps here and there if you don't mind queuing 45 minutes+ for a picture with Donald-duck. I didn't see any Mickey-Mouse of Minnie-Mouse photo-opps.

Apparently if you go during winter when it's raining and cold it's possible to avoid the crowding and queues. The colleague at work also mentioned having time to use 4 fast-passes in one day with his family.","Written June 19, 2017",2.0 of 5 bubbles
1115,Vacation that requires planning and strategy.,"We bought the tickets from the partner hotel we stayed in. We traveled tail end of May 2017. Have a game plan on where to go/ride first and what to fast pass while you're in line. Download an app that will show you wait times for attractions. The lines are indeed long but nobody cuts in line or whines in line, hence if they say 1hr 20mins in line, then expect no more than 1hr 20mins. Shows, dialogue are in Japanese so don't expect subtitles or English shows. Cast members actually call people to sit in designated areas to watch parades - as long as those areas aren't filled up yet.

The park has a lot of the same rides that the US parks do, but the main one that it does not have is the Pooh's Honey Hut. We rode this about 4 times. It is a trackless ride and there are 3 cars per group. Each car does something different, so be sure to ride each car at least once.

We also found that the food was not as expensive in the states and also of much better quality. We snacked a lot on different types of foods and they were all delicious.

The only thing I definitely recommend is that you need to get here before rope drop so you can get on as many rides as possible and work to get your fast passes quick. This park fills up fast and the locals know how to work the fast pass system.

The best thing to eat that I highly recommend are the Pizza Spring Rolls in Toontown. Those things are seriously heavenly. Cast members are really nice and considerate. Merchandise is adorable.

1125,Pure Disney Magic,"Had an excellent time with my kids 4 and 6 years old. They have rides for all ages. The popular rides had very long lines.

Get the free fast pass for the popular rides as soon as you can. There is time limit before you can get a fast pass for the next ride. The fastpass machines are located next to their respective rides. Just scan your ticket at the machine to be issued the fastpass. The fastpass will designate a specific time for you to return to take the ride.

For popular rides such as Buzz lightyear and Star Wars, the standby lines were quite short past 9pm (I was there on a Monday). Managed to take the Star Wars ride only once in the morning but 3 times after 9pm.

Splash mountain was fantastic but the lines were long, even with the fastpass the wait was 10-15mins.

If you have young children, do get a contact sticker from customer service next to the main entrance and stick it on their shirts in case they get lost in the park. After you write your details on the sticker, do cover it with the Disney logo sticker also provided with the contact sticker. In the event your kid gets lost, the staff will peal off the Disney logo to reveal your child's name and contact info. There is a centre for lost children next to the entrance. Hope this helps.

The Magic Kingdom parks are all pretty similar, but I've found there are way more characters out and about to get photos with (YAY!) in Tokyo. There's a really good range of non-rollercoaster rides (Winnie the Pooh ride is VERY popular).

The food is lovely (much nicer than the USA parks) and pretty affordable, by theme park standards.

But what I really couldn't get over was how NICE everyone was. Even in the crowded sections, people were very considerate, spoke at a quiet level, and were just purely happy to be there.
We also noticed there seemed to be more of a young adult audience than families with young kids (aka no sea of prams to avoid bumping in to).","Written June 5, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1131,Great for Disney fans!,"Look up tips for visiting the Tokyo Disney Parks, its extremely helpful when deciding the length and time of year to go. I didn't have any ""I wish.."" regrets with a day and a half, but it wasn't crowded and we went on everything within the first half of the day. We dedicated more of our stay to DisneySea.

Get in line an hour before the park opens, there will be at least 40 people already there waiting. When the park opens every goes to get fast passes for Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monster's Inc Ride & Go Seek. I'd recommend getting a fast pass for Monster's Inc, it's closer, then getting in the stand-by line for Pooh's Honey Hunt. We went on these rides multiple times, they were that fun.

I would recommend going on everything, it is Disneyland, but these were my favorites:
Monster's Inc Ride & Go Seek
Pooh's Honey Hunt
Haunted Mansion
Splash Mountain
Space Mountain
Cinderella's Fairy Tale Hall

MUST-SHOWS- it's mainly in Japanese, but still very entertaining
Once Upon A Time- (it will close permanently in November 2017)-there is a pretty identical version that was recently placed in Walt Disney World

1138,I guess I was lucky...,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland on Sunday May 28, 2017. After reading the terrible and poor reviews (and listening to friends who previously visited), I expected the worst. So, I made sure I got an e-ticket ahead of time, wrote out a ""shopping list"" of rides I wanted to ride and got to the entrance to the Park (not the ticket booth since I had an e-ticket) at 6am. I would say that there were already 100+ people in line for an 8am opening (bring a book to pass the time away). Just before 8am, all the people who are staying at the Disney Resort got to go in first; it seemed like a 100+ people. So, I thought, shucks, all these 100 people are going to Pooh's Honey Hunt (PHH) and there will be a long wait. Well, when it was my turn to enter, I went straight to PHH, but it was temporarily closed due to mechanical problems. So I went straight to Splash Mountain and got a FP. After getting the FP, since the line was short, I stood in line. All in all, for being in the Park for 10 hours (I was away for 4 hours in the afternoon from 2-6pm to rest/shower in my hotel room which gave me energy for the evening), I got to ride PHH 3 times; Splash Mt 4 times; Pirates, Jungle Cruise, Haunted Mansion, Mark Twain, Western River Railway all one time. Get your flavored popcorn early because the lines get long. (I was wondering why all these kids were carrying these cute little character buckets (like Halloween. It's for the popcorn!) Hint: The only ride that allows for single riders is Splash Mt. Even if there are 4 of you, if you go as a single rider, you won't have to wait the 120 minutes. You may have to wait 20 minutes as single riders get on when a single rider is needed to fill a log. Highlights: the Electrical Parade (Baroque Hoedown brings back memories to Disneyland's Electrical Parade) and PHH. PHH is such a cute ride (especially for the young at heart). It's like being on a bumper car without getting hit. You go in all different directions. Wish the ride was longer, though, since you have to wait a long time to ride. Even the line for a FP was long. Because of the weather, Fireworks show was cancelled. Also, Autopia ride closed in January 2017 to make way for something else and Small World is being refurbished. And if you miss hearing the English language while in Japan, some of the rides are spoken in English. I was going to submit the following complaint to Guest Relations (but decided to ride more rides instead); when there's no one in the FP line for PHH, then let the people in the regular line go in. No, I had to wait because I guess so many FP people are let in at time and then just 5 regular people and then FP people again. Also, I was able to take my backpack on Splash Mt.","Written May 31, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

I got lost buying my stupid magnet. I couldn't find my family inside so I went outside. I couldn't find them there so I decided to enter again (10pm). The pass that I had with me was a junior pass, maybe I interchanged with my nephews while trying to access Fast Pass. So they wouldn't let me in. I was getting furious because it's as if I can still do anything at 10pm there. I even showed them the magnet & receipt that I got to prove i was already inside. So I asked them to tell me where the nearest free wifi is because my wifi is with my husband who was with my family waiting inside. One of them accompanied me going to the free wifi spot near the train already. So I was able to get free wifi and called my husband. Indeed all 9 of them were inside waiting for me.","Written May 30, 2017",2.0 of 5 bubbles
1141,The Magic that is Disney!,"We spent one day of our 3 day pass here and to be honest it was the right amount of time. We visited as a family of 4 ( 2 adults and 2 kids aged 10 & 7). We had prepurchased tickets which saved us a lot of time at the entry. There's a tram loop line that runs constantly between 4 stops ( Disney Sea, Disney Land, Metro/Train station & Tokyo Bay Hotels Stop). We used the tram loop line from our hotel (Sheraton Grande) and it was a 5 minute ride). We visited on a Wednesday and I was surprised at the size of the crowd.

- Fast Passes- How do they work? Basically, each entry ticket is also your Fast Pass ticket. You can't purchase additional express tickets. On your Map, it will highlight which attractions offer Fast Pass entries. At the front of each attraction, there are FP scanners with a clock that shows you what the allocated return time is at that point in time. Once you've scanned, you are given a 30-40 minute window of time to return. Depending on how busy or popular a ride is, you may scan at 9:30 am and be told to return at 7pm! Be advised, once you have scanned your pass, you cannot obtain any other fast passes until your current FP allocated time expires. There are no limits as to how many FP passes you can have however you are limited due to the crowds and them selling out.

- Take note on their website with regards to what rides will be closed during your visit. We missed out on Space Mountain which was an absolute shame :(

- The rides at this park are quite tame and suitable for kids of ages 5+. Our favourites were Star Tours, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Haunted Mansion, Mickeys PhillarMagic and the Tea Cups!

- At around 4:30pm a huge wave of school kids appeared, not sure if these are locals with annual passes coming in for a quick ride however it added to the wait times. Average wait times were 30-90 minutes depending on the ride (splash mountain was the longest wait).

- Some rides are very repetitive. These were mostly in the Fantasyland area.

- We gave the night show a miss the first night which was a great opportunity to ride some of the rides as this alleviated wait times.

- Definitely try a Mickey Waffle at the Great American Waffle Co! Amazing!!

- We had lunch at the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall. It was quite surreal inside and offered some whimsical desserts. They were fairly priced however, I did get sick from the swordfish here which resulted in us ending the night earlier than anticipated.

All in all, a great visit and a memorable one for the kids. I would give it a miss if your kids or group are aged 15 or over as the rides are very tame and attractions not so elaborate!","Written May 30, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

So i was not sure what to expect when i took the kids to this Tokyo one at the end of our family ski trip this year. I was not disappointed though - it was great. I loved that it was all in Japanese, so we couldn't actually understand anything. it made it fun. especially the jungle boat ride - that was hilarious.
The lines were absolutely terrible it was taking nearly 3 hours to get on rides without a fast pass, so that part was bad. however, we did go on a Sunday and i would not recommend that to anyone else. The Japanese are so polite. Everyone is just great at lining up. They line up for everything. Popcorn... taking a photo... it is all extremely civilised. that part was really nice.

Tips:

Super crowded park. Purchase your ticket online and get to the park earlier (1 hour before opening hours). The queue with pre-paid online tickets to enter the park for non-peak season is still overwhelming! Go there early!

Get fastpass for popular rides. Check the queue time before getting the fastpass, if the queue time is short then it is not worth getting a fastpass for the ride. You can collect another fastpass even before using the previous fastpass, after a certain duration. Go read up some guides of the fastpass in the web.

There are apps to check live ride queue times.

For dinner in restaurants, make sure you prebook it to avoid disappointment! Mostly fully booked.","Written May 18, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Every restaurant is full, we need to wait at least 2 hour to get a table. But the attraction is so attractive and fun, and the souvenir was really cute. But for any traveler who visited this park, we need to pay attention to our belongings. Because if we want to enjoy an attraction or eat in the restaurant we need to parking our stroller out side, at first I tough it was amazing that everyone let their belongings stay in their stroller while they enjoying the attraction. So it means this themed park is safe from any lost or thief. But something bad happened to us, we lost our ergo baby carrier that we put in our stroller outside the restaurant, even though there is a waitress standing and waving for new customer near the stroller parking. But they can't say nothing about our complaint that we lost our stuff. Poor us. After eat we enter an attraction then parking out stroller ""again"" then ""again"" we lost our thing.

There's a great Disney atmosphere around the park just like the Florida one with all the same music and smells.
All the rides are great and so are the parades.
They use the old style of fast passes around the parks where you need to go to the ride to collect a fast pass ticket to return later. Which I think is better than the new system in Florida.
So when you first enter the park it's best to go straight to the ride you want a FP for first then a short time later you can get another fast pass.
It was fairly busy when we went but we still got on everything. I can see why people get a FP for the Winnie the pooh ride as Well, it's a lovely ride and well done.
Again all the food was delicious, the honey and curry popcorn is worth trying, didn't like the soy sauce one much though as it was just like salty popcorn!
We ate at the Queen of hearts restaurant which was very nice and was about ¬£28 for a drink, two mains, a dessert and a kids meal set.
Also the pizza in the Toy town area is very scrummy and the cakes from the bakery.
The only thing that disappointed us were the fireworks. We we sat waiting for them a 3 mins before they cancelled them due to bad weather, it was a lovely night with no rain or wind. They also did this the next night and when they did do the fireworks on our last night we watched from our hotel balcony as we were packing and you couldn't see them properly due to the thick cloud and it had been raining all day, so no idea what happened There!

The Japanese visitors set a wonderful example of how to behave. They sit down patiently, weather permitting, awaiting the park doors to open. They do not push, shove or toss food on the floor and rarely eat in line. They speak softly and politely. It's the visitors speaking in Korean or Mandarin who I find are more obnoxious in line or at restaurants. It's the cleanest Disney park I've seen and they have popcorn trucks everywhere. In the US, popcorn would be strewn all over the place. No dirty paper towels on bathroom floors, cigarette butts or gum and sticky drinks stuck on the pavement. Makes for a much happier experience.

We let our adult kids navigate and because Space Mountain and Small World were both closed, we were able to see everything we wanted to see. The food trucks have unique items. We liked the hot, sweet potato tipa torta Y3.60 the best. Long sticks resembling churro with a sweet pasty center. Crunchy on the outside. We didn't like the chocolate one. We didn't like the melon churro either. Consistent with DL pricing, a lot of the food is overpriced with small portions. We tried the cinnamon churro rolled so when you look at a cross section, resembles a Mickey head. Very gimmicky and was hard and dried out.

My 2 funniest experiences here was when the doors opened and people were running to the rides. I was laughing so hard as we don't see that in DL Anaheim often. One 5-7 yr old fell and picked himself up and kept running. Staff members everywhere holding signs advising not to run. Another time, 2 young ladies behind us were talking softly, laughing and taking pictures in line. On the ride, they started building momentum with sounds that contestants make on Japanese game shows per my kids, then the girls would scream on the ride. I couldn't stop laughing. It's like watching a reserved person suddenly let loose and go wild in Disneyland.

The rides are fairly identical to the Anaheim DL with some variations. Poohs Hunny Hunt was very cute. I thought Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted House were darker rides due to lighting. Voyage of Simbad was cute with nice music and singing of the song, Compass of Your Heart, by K. Sakamoto. The ride is similar to It's a Sm World.

The place is very large and spacious not congested like at DL. My kid liked this DL the best. I enjoyed the different types of food offerings, even if some are hit or miss, and really liked the civility of the Japanese. The last ride of the day, we were on the Jungle Cruise. I saw one of the Disney managers chatting with staff in his suit with name tag on. Later, he removed his tag, climbed into the boat and observed the staff at work while riding with us. At the end of the ride, he stayed behind, replaced his tag and chatted with staff. I've never seen suits at DL Anaheim visit with staff to either check in, make observation visits or hang to talk to staff and this was 9:45 PM. Maybe DL parks in the US would run better if managers took a more hands on approach to get feedback from front line staff.","Written May 10, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

1173,An Experience that you must get!!.,"1) Start your day early.
2) I bought my tickets from Singapore, so i did not have to wait in the already long queue that was present there when i arrived @ 0800hrs.
3) My mistake was that i did not buy the express pass. If you are not a local, BUY the express pass, you will save alot of time and energy. I had to wait an average of 40-80mins for each attraction in queue while those with express passes were just ""Zooming"" through.
4) If you are going there with young kids, pack some light food (sandwiches, mineral water, etc..) The queue for buying food and water is equally long.
Plan your route early. They have lots of shows at specific time, so do identify the ones that you wanna go and be there early.
5) Make sure to take all rides and i'm pretty sure your kids and adults alike will have a wonderful and magical experience.
6) Allocate an entire day for this outing. I was there from 0800hrs till 1900hrs.","Written May 8, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Very similar in terms of attractions to Disneyland California - except much more space at Tokyo Disneyland. No barging into people and feeling cramped.

We spent the full day there, making use of the Good Neighbour Hotels shuttle bus from our hotel in Daiba. Unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled due to 'weather' (not sure what weather, maybe it was too cloudy?) but we watched the parade, then made use of the no queues to go on Space mountain twice in a row in the space of ten minutes while people were watching the projection mappings on the castle.

1180,The best Disneyland in the world...and definitely the cleanest I have visited!,"This Disneyland really felt like a dream...the visit was close to perfect!

The good: large and spacious park, clean, polite staff, doable in one day (if you are quick!)
-I really have to commend the cleanliness...I couldn't even see a single speck of dust on the parade route!
-Highly suggest watching the Minnie Oh Minnie show (you may think it's for young children, but it is actually VERY entertaining and has lots of latin music)
-One Man's Dream is great too (when I went there was no lottery so that was even better)
-the explorer canoes are great for those who want to see the critter country lake faster (although it gets tiring paddling for so long)
-highly suggest going to Toontown as well (there are things for adults to do too!)
-You MUST DEFINITELY watch the ""Once Upon A Time"" fireworks. It will really ""ignite the dream in your heart"", and the accompanying music still has me singing a year from the visit.

Another amazing area is the Bazaar. If you need gifts and souvenirs, you will go NUTS when you see the things on offer. I suggest spending at LEAST one hour in the shops because there are so many cute things to buy. The prices are a little expensive though.

I couldn't really think of anything bad, except maybe the lines for some rides (I did not even attempt lining up for some like Winnie the Pooh because the line wait was like 50 minutes)","Written May 4, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The staff at both Disneyland and Disneysea are probably the nicest and most polite you will ever meet in a theme park which is very common in Japan. The ride I was looking forward to the most was the Winnie the Pooh's ride which was closed for maintenance. The Flume ride and the ghost mansion were amazing; however, the grizzly mountain roller coaster and the space mountain were a bit lackluster compared to their counterparts in Hong Kong Disneyland and they needed more thrills added into them. Overall, it was an amazing experience but if you are out of time and can only visit one of Tokyo's Disney Parks, go for Disneysea.

But surprisingly as an impatient person, I was able to patiently wait for around an hour for a ride. I read a lot about fastpass before my visit but as I arrive at 12pm, I did not manage to get any. Well it's not the end of the world though! In fact I find the rides I done was far from memorable as the daytime parade, electric parade, firework and Cinderella castle light show. Dining at the queens banquet was amazing too and we managed to avoid the crowd by having dinner at 4.30pm. The queue was twice as long when we left! Winnie the Pooh ride was a WOW ending to my visit (the queue was still long even at 9pm) as it really amazed me how they designed the routes for the electric cars.

The most intriguing part of the visit was observing the Disney outfits worn by visitors to the park. Bought the three day pass but only spent one day here. Tip: it is cheaper to purchase from the Disney shop at Maihama Station than to purchase in the park.","Written May 1, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Suggest that one should go and take fast pass on the post famous rides as they are marked on the map. Remember to carry a jacket for sure and don't wear summer clothes as it gets really windy there and a jacket and jeans is must.

I assume people don't know much about Easter concept. Anyway, the on-going parade was all about bunnies and eggs called Usatama. The story was the bunny like eggs, Usatama were running away, Mickey and friends were trying to capture them. The parade song was half Japanese and half English. Costume, dance and parade itself was full of originality and very interesting that visitors could enjoy the uniqueness of Tokyo Disney Land.
However, most of the attraction was solely operated in Japanese. I personally wondered if they should hire more casts who can speak multiple languages or install some subtitle board displayed English and more languages electronically for non Japanese speakers at each ride or show.
Other than language barrier, they have offered unique food, interesting snack and fun and collectible souvenirs that we can't find in the US.","Written April 30, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1187,Great Disney experience,"This was my first trip to a disneyland and the size and scale of ecerything took some getting used to. Huge amount of people but in true Japanese style, its ordered chaos and you dont feel over crowded and everyone is respectful.
The park is huge and we didnt really understand the fast pass system at first but went in an anticlockwise direction from opening and we seemed to walk into each attraction with minimal wait times. I enjoyed the ""Star Tours"" attraction the most as we didnt know what we walked into and although it was all in Japanese it was still fun. Not sure what the hype is about the Winnie the Pooh ride is as it was the most boring for us, over all the rides here are not thrill rides.
The fast passes have an hour or so wait time on them, so once you get one for a ride you cant grab one for a different ride straight away. We also didnt realise the lines at the front gate were to get in, not actually purchase the tickets, so if you are buying at the park, look for the ticket booths (in between the massive lines waiting to get in).

Other than that, explore the park and enjoy the night light parade, its amazing.","Written April 30, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Tokyo Disney and DisneySea are the friendliest parks out there. The Cast Members are friendly, helpful, and willing to go out of their way to help you.

They are always smiling, the park was always clean, most people ( not Americans) dressed up for their visit to the park, so it was a great atmosphere.

It was sad to see so many big ticket rides closed at once - We were unable to ride Pirates, Winnie the Pooh or Small World due to closures. But over all we had an amazing time, well worth a visit.","Written April 29, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1189,Great nostalgia hit and beautiful Nighttime parade,"First time to Disneyland and it was a long but worthwhile day. I went as an adult with a group of adult friends, but we all enjoyed reliving our childhood and having fun. Food was more reasonably priced than I expected too! If you can make it out the whole day, DEFINITELY stay for the final electric parade. The floats are incredible!

Unfortunately, some rides were also closed during April 2017. Check online before planning the trip. We were a little disappointed by this.

I took as much advice from online as possible:
- go early
- go on a weekday
- try not to catch school holidays

It turned out wise to follow this advice. Still, by lunch time you should be expecting to wait in lines for a while.

If you are going with your friends as an adult, realise that the rides aren't going to blow you away. The best picks when we went were Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and Astro Blasters.","Written April 29, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Afterwards we went on to try all the rides (unfortunately Space Mountain was closed for repairs), but Star Tours had been updated since last time I visited Disneyland in Paris, so we tried it 7 times in a row... that's how great it was. All the rides were just pure fun, just as we're used to and we just continued until late evening until we had to leave.

1213,"For the disabled, TIPS N HINTS!!","Well I'm partly disabled. I can't stand for long periods so waiting in line is out of the question.
So here's how to get around Disneyland in comfort.
Head straight to your right once entering DL. Look for a house with PINK circular walls just under the roof.
There you can hire normal wheelchair, baby carts, electric 4 wheeled scooter. This scooter you sit in and turn the throttle to move, it's ¬•2000 a day. Batteries work great.
Now!!! you have to plan ahead on what you want to do, see and ride.
There are passes called FAST PASS. Google n check what they are.
So pick one of the main rides you want to do. And use fast pass for that.
NOW YOU HAVE AN electric scooter, this entitles you to receive a SPECIAL GUEST PASS. It works be same way the FAST PASS does. So now go to the second ride you REALLY want to do and use your SPECIAL PASS.
Now once this is done there will be a wait till your ride times come up. So this is a great way to do the rides, shows etc that take 20- 40 mins per wait. BUT these and all rides etc you can't take the scooter in the line. You will have to stand. But if you can't stand for more than an hour without a break I feel Disney will be a struggle in this instance. ( 20-40min wait).
Also please be patient while on the scooter. You will have many people not looking where they are going and get in your road while driving around.","Written April 17, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

If you are able to include the nighttime parade in your schedule it is a must.... one of the most enjoyable aspects of the visit.

We went there on Friday to avoid the crowd which was a good strategy, the weather was very good that all the outdoor activities were also very enjoyable. The night performance was another highlight that one should not miss.

Planning the rides with fast pass was another good strategy, with that we managed to take most of the rides within one day visit. Our kids really enjoy the rides and all the performances which we can always feel their passion. The friendly park assistants were always around with smiling face to guide and assist.

Fast passes also disappear within the first hour of opening.

1233,A magical end to our holiday!,"Having been to Disney World Orlando, Disneyland California, Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Hong Kong we were determined to finish our two week tour of Japan at Disneyland Tokyo. As we were there on April 6th, which is school holidays and cherry blossom festival for Japan we knew it would be ultra busy but we were pleasantly surprised that we managed to do so many rides. We decided we would not go on anything with a queue longer than 40 minutes but were fortunate that most only had 20 minute waits we did - Pinocchio, Snow White, Peter Pan, Haunted House, Splash Mountain, Canoes, Spinning Cups, Star Tours, Railroad and Swiss Family Tree House. We avoided Space Mountain, Buzz, and Thunder Mountain as the queues were well over an hour. We did Country Bear Jamboree, Minnie Oh Minnie, Enchanted Tiki Birds and we watched the Easter Parade ‚ÄúUsatama on the Run!"" and the Electric Parade. We had an absolutely wonderful day and left just after 8pm as we had a 6.30 am pick up the following morning. The journey from our Hotel Metropolitan in Ikebukuro took approx 1 hour on the circle line and the Keio line and was very easy to follow.

1234,Busiest Disney in the world,"We arrived in April and it must have coincided with school holidays in Japan. Crowds were present from the opening time to the closing time. Standby lines for the popular rides went over an hour to two or more within an hour of opening. We booked 4 days so that we could do Disney Sea and Disneyland 2 days each. My kids are 8 and 11 so they are not interested in the smaller kids rides (i.e. fantasyland, toon town rides). So we spent our time at space mountain, thunder mountain railroad, splash mountain, the haunted mansion, monsters inc, and we caught a number of shows. I think that when standby lines get over 2 hours, it substantially reduces the experience for Disney guests. I don't think they hit capacity limits during my time there, but I shudder to think what the park would look like if capacity limits were invoked. Even with the huge crowds, we still managed to have fun. It would just be better if the park management were making sure to manage the customer experience vis a vis wait times.

One thing I have to say about Japanese Disney fans, they are very orderly and patiently stand in some of the longest lines I've ever seen at any Disney resort. Even the line for popcorn was 50 deep at times.","Written April 8, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1235,DO NOT MISS THIS!,"Hubby and I had 16 days in Japan across March and April and I had allocated my birthday to go to Disneyland.. well there was our first mistake... only allocating one day. Get a 2 day pass bare minimum, its very busy with people and so many things to see and do and be part of. We are almost 40 both of us and we were like a couple of little kids all day and were still in the park after closing time from 9am. We were there for 14 hours!!! Hubby even suggested extending our pass to 2 days and postponing our trip back to Osaka for a day so we could spend another day in Disneyland.

Catch the train to Maihama station from Tokyo for a few hundred yen and walk the rest of the few hundred metres to the attraction. The walk is amazing as you can see the castle from outside the park and as you get closer and closer the excitement builds!

Number 1 after you purchase your ticket (around 7000 yen per adult for 1 day)..... if your carrying stuff...get a locker just before you enter the main section for a few hundred yen and dump your stuff before you get into the day. You can take your own food and drink.. this is a great way of saving money as some food and drinks inside are expensive and the lines are long. We took some and purchased some to lessen the cost and increase the convenience due to the long wait lines. Buy your Mickey ears or Minnie bows or other things you want to wear during the day at the start, but leave the rest of your merch till the end of the day unless you get a locker, you dont want to carry that around all day and try to shove it in places to go oin the rides.

Dont miss the parade, twice a day once around 2pm and again around 7pm for the night parade with all the floats lit up. See both parades, its well worth it. Get your spot along the side of the road about an hour or more before hand to get the full experience.

Rides can have you waiting a LOOOOONG time, the longest one we saw was 170 mins and the end of the line will be displayed on a tall sign being manned by a staff member. Splash mountain, thunder mountain and space mountain all seem to be the main rides people want to experience so expect lengthy delays there. We loved every ride we went on! On splash mountain iof you want to skip the line and are willing to ride seperate from others in your group tell the attendant at the end of the line you want to be a single rider.... that will cut your wait by a good hour or more. It just means you will probably go on the ride without anyone you know. We did it, it was great skipping the line. You can also get there VERY early and look into getting fastpasses for rides, you are basically allocated a time to go back to each ride you chose and you dont have to wait as long as if you just jump on the end of ther line.

Check out EVERY land, we decided to skip Toontown because we thought it would be more for the little kids but ended up around the area so decided to go in after all.... it was so much fun! Half the fun of places like this is being able to revert back to your childhood and be reminded of watching Cinderella or Snow White and feeling the magic all over again. And you do... you REALLY do! You see the characters and the 6 year old inside you gets excited and next thing your asking strangers to take your photo with Mickey Mouse or escaping from Toontowns dog pound display! Go with it, its amazing.

Wear comfy shoes as you will walk and stand in lines A LOT.
If you have kids you can borrow strollers for the day and there is designated pram parks all over the park including at the entrance to the rides so you wont miss out.. Plenty of toilets with child facilities too.

Its a small world was closed for maintenance while we were there but the rest was open and fantastic!

You HAVE to stay for the light and sound display and fire works that start around 9pm. theres a short display and you think oh that was nice... where are we going next.. then they announce that 'Once upon a time' will commence in 15 mins.. now THAT is something you CANNOT MISS! I almost cried I got so emotional as the childhood memoreis came flodding back, I even video called my mum back in Australia to show her it was soooo good! The lights, the sounds, the fire works and the images displayed on the front of the castle are astounding. Fantastic!

1240,Another Great Disney Experience,"I will preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Disney. Being from the United States, I went to Walt Disney World in Orlando quite a few times throughout my life, and have probably experienced it from all perspectives (as an awe-struck 6 year old, as a ""too cool for school 13 year old, as an 18 year old interested in the business side of it, and as a 20 year old with my girlfriend at Disneyland Paris). This trip to Disney Tokyo was everything I could have hoped for. Now, after having been to Disneyland Paris I knew that all of the other Disneyland's don't compare to that of Disney World, so I had a good mindset going in. The park is small enough to do in 1 maybe 2 days, and wouldn't recommend any more time than that. Its just classic disney with all of the classic characters and rides. And its kind of cool to hear Buzz Lightyear speak Japanese while waiting inline for ""his ride"". Only negative experience that I had with the whole thing was really a minor thing. I am a 6 foot 3, in shape (not fat) 21 year old American, and am definitely the minority in Asia in terms of body size. My friend and I wanted to ride in the front car in Space Mountain but I was too big and didn't fit because my legs were too long. Even in one of the bigger carts in the back it was a very tight squeeze and was barely able to fit in the cart. I have never had that problem back home at any amusement park, especially not at Disney. But I understand that I am definitely not the typical customer that they get, so I don't really have a problem with it.","Written April 5, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1241,Go early,"We arrived at 12:00 pm on a Thursday and most of the fast passes were gone for the day or were timed for the evening. Walking around there didn't seem to be too many people, yet the rides had up to a 2 hour line up. My kids are 17 and 21, they have been to California Disneyland 4 times over the past 10 years so they are quite familiar with navigating the park and rides. Tokyo Disneyland is similar to California, the main street is shorter. Disney Sea is very different from California Adventure. From 12-9:45 pm my kids only managed to ride 5 rides, so a bit disappointing. Also, the distance between Disneyland and Disney Sea is a bit of a walk so I suggest taking the monorail, which has a fee. I purchased my tickets online in Canada and in the North America the paper size is different so I was fortunate to reprint them in Japan. We purchased our After 6pm Disney Sea tickets at the Disney store in Shibuya. The tickets overall are cheaper then in California, It was good to experience but not the best for rides.","Written April 5, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

Long queue for rides and even popcorn. I understand that waiting can assist in anticipation but 2.5hours for meal and 1hr for popcorn is a bit ridiculous. Nope, we didn't go on weekend, and it is not the golden week or Holiday.

Another really discrimination experience is dining. Finer table dining restaurants all require advanced booking. It is ok if it is well mentioned or online booking is easily available, which unfortunately NEITHER is the case! The website advanced booking is only available in Japanese only makes the situation more disappointing.

1247,"Most crowded place on earth, definitely not the happiest","Context: We are in our twenties, first time to Tokyo disneyland, have been to Orlando disneyland, went on a Monday in April 2017.

Tips for first-time goers: go at opening time, buy and print admission ticket in advance, download TDR app (wait times), get fast passes for the most popular rides first (eg space mountain, buzz lightyear) as fastpasses for these will run out by noon (can get fast passes every two hours), bring snacks/drinks, prepare to wait in queues for the entirety of your time here (1hr for food, 2hrs for rides), bring an entertainment device to pass time.

This place is extremely, unbelievably crowded. We made the mistake of going at 10am instead of 8am. We got the star tours fast pass at 1030, then by the time two hours were up at approx noon, fast passes for most popular rides (eg space mountain, buzz lightyear) had already finished distributing. The only ride left for fastpass was haunted mansion - by this stage there was a long queue for the fastpass distribution itself.

Overall we spent 8 hours here:
- Luckily watched One Man's Dream show (recommend; lasts 30minutes)
- waited 40 minutes for pirates of caribbean ride
- Star tours ride via fast pass: definitely recommend however such a short ride
- Waited 50 minutes for pizza lunch
- waited 110 minutes for haunted mansion ride (do not recommend - narration in japanese, not a roller coaster but a swivelling seat)
- Various 10-20minute waits in queues for popcorn, pastry, etc
- Visited various gift shops that sell the same stuff

Essentially you will come here, go on three rides, spend more money on food and souvenirs, and then wait for hours in queues. Also, the place was disappointing as it did not feel like a ""Disney""land at all. It just feels like a large open space with various plain buildings and some decoration inside whilst selling Disney merchandise. I will not be returning.

1250,Plan ahead!,"This was our third visit to the park. It definitely helps to have some knowledge about the most popular rides, where to get fast passes, show times etc. March is the busiest month, so avoid it if possible, but if you're on spring break with everyone else, plan ahead, book online if possible, get there early (park opens at 8am) and be prepared to queue. We were there at 9am and fast passes for the best rides were giving a 530pm return time. My husband queued for 40 minutes just for popcorn! In the end we watched Super Duper Jumpin Time after waiting 40 minutes to save our spot. I recommend it because the characters all come into the crowd and mingle with the kids after the show. We waited 2 hours to save a great spot for the parade and in between rode the train and explored Tom Sawyers island because the lines were shorter. I'm glad we packed lunch because that would have been another long wait. There are two areas on opposite sides of the park with vending machines selling water, coke etc. Water is free in any of the dining areas. We refilled our drink bottles at those.

Crowds aside, it's a great Disney atmosphere and very well organised.

1262,"Magical Place for Every Child Dreams, Don't forget your Fast Pass","We visited Tokyo Disneyland as group of friends. My thought about this place is Magical! Since we have our ""child dreams"" to be a prince and princess, this is the exact place to see the magical things. Here is the world of imagination, hopes, and dreams.
I recommend this place for Family or for Disney lovers out there because we can see more ""Disney"" inside out (compare to Disneysea), but for thrill seeker, this maybe not the right place for you. Because most of the attraction is kids-friendly.
Compared to other theme park in Japan, this has shorter waiting time, but first you enter the park, check out the fast pass schedule on Board around the park. You just need to find the time the fast pass open for the attraction and scan your QR code (entrance ticket) to get the fast passes. We managed to get 3 fast pass that day.
We arrived around 10 am and going back around closing time 10-11pm. We managed to play up to 10 attractions. Since we visited this around winter so we couldn't make it into splash mountain and unfortunately the big thunder mountain also closed. But we have our leisure time to take pictures and enjoy the beauty of the park. We recommended the Alice in wonderland food area, it's so beautiful yet delicious. If you're looking for tap for drinking water, it's quiet hard there but in every food area there's free drinking station with paper cup available.
Don;t forget to get ready to watch the parade, fireworks, and closing show. (The schedule is in map when we entrance the park. Don't forget for each of you to bring the map in case some of you lost inside the park). The parade is so magical! I recommended you to watch the night parade because there's illumination effect and its more beautiful compared to previous noon parade. The best spot for you is near the Cinderella castle in Fantasyland but be ready for the full packed!","Written March 24, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

There is no priority given to kids or babies for the queues. We only managed one ride after queuing for 2 hours. FastPass ends by 10am in the morning! The most enjoyable part of the day was watching the FROZEN parade with Elsa and Olaf for him. Many of the local parents brought groundsheets to sit on while waiting for the parade.

We also like the fast pass provided at the parks with no additional cost. What we need to do is grab the fast pass during diapensing time by scanning the barcode at our tickets and come during the specified timing. So that we can enjoy more attraction and rides. The Attractions and rides very suitable for kids. So far only one attraction which is stich interaction which is done in japanese and we can't understand a single words.

There are plenty snacks available in the park such as popcorn, turkey leg, churos, ice cream but most of the stalls have quite long queue. Food served at the stall also quite nice and reasonably priced. We did not go to more fancy restaurant.","Written March 17, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

When the barrier were lifted, we all went in and we chose the last row as I wanted to catch a full view of the fireworks and at the middle as everyone moved in tandem to find our space since it's free sitting on the ground. my helper sat beside me on the last row while we let my Son move infront of us. Besides me and my helper, there were Japanese young girls. My helper sat half to a feet infront of the Japanese girl besides her. Then a male staff from Disneyland insisted tt we move away just bec the japanese gal refused to give space to us when we requested. He and his colleagues insisted that it was too cramp. He and his colleagues later told me there's only two space. so I ask my helper to go to another place at the side and meet me later. But he and his staff came back again n told us there's only 1 space. They changed their version n asked us to move to the side to join Yati. At this point I stood firm on my position as there's about 2 feet spaces infront of me, I placed my bag infront of me and there were quite a lot of space infront of the girls infront of us and I'm not touch anyone. That lady besides me complaint that I touched her which was untrue. Staff of Disneyland kept insisted that my Son n I shift to the sides because the girl besides me made a complaint. I went to see the customer service manager after the fireworks, he refused to take down my complaint.

Express tickets disappeared so fast we couldn't even put them to use. The rest of the time we spent being crushed in the hoards of people. On the bright side the parades were awesome - especially the electric parade at night. However unfortunately a downpour struck and there were so many people there wasn't enough shelter so we ended up getting soaked to the skin! We left with both kids in tears.

We definitely won't return and feel we wasted a valuable day of our holiday. Unless you are a die-hard Disney fan I would suggest giving this place a very wide berth.","Written March 14, 2017",2.0 of 5 bubbles
1275,Might not be the best but the atmosphere was the best,"Compared with DisneySea, the Land feels very average. It might not be the best Disneyland, especially if you compare to those in USA. But what I like the most is the atmosphere. Japan certainly can brings out the ""magic"" in Disney. It could be the staff, it could be the technology, it could also be the visitors. You just cant feel it in any other Disney parks.

The rides here are mostly aimed for kids. If you are looking for adrenaline rush, go to FujiQ instead where they have one of the scariest roller coaster in the world, and the scariest haunted house ever in life.

Make sure to plan ahead before your visit. It can get very crowded on weekends, public holiday, and high season. Avoid national holidays for neighboring countries too, such as China, Korea, etc. Chances are they will come to visit Japan during their holiday, and visit Disney parks. Do some research beforehand. Land is usually less crowded than Sea. When we came last October, it felt like the park belonged only to us.

Buy ticket online to avoid wasting 1 hour to queue up for the ticket. Once you enter the park, run to the most famous attraction and grab the Fast pass, then you queue on the least famous attraction. That way you can maximize your fun.","Written March 13, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1294,Loved it! Wear comfy shoes!,"Absolutely loved Tokyo Disneyland!
Go during the week - weekends and holidays are crazy busy!

A few tips: get in early (Disneyland opens at 8am, DisneySea at 8.30am).

You go through security but the checking isn't very thorough! We took food and drink in with us and they didn't bat an eyelid.

The great thing about Tokyo Disney is the Fast Pass system - very unlike any I've come across elsewhere. It is free! All the rides marked with FP on the maps have a separate FP stall near to that ride's entrance. You can get a FP here for that ride and return at a later point. The only hitch is that you can only have one FP at a time, so you need to plan ahead a little (e.g. Get a FP as soon as you arrive, for say, Space Mountain, and then as soon as you've done that ride or the FB time limit reopens, grab your FP for Thunder mountain). The Hunny Pot ride was busy (not an adrenaline seekers ride, but definitely one not to miss!). The Toy Story ride and Monsters Inc were both incredibly busy.

Oddly, Star Wars did not seem a busy ride. We went on it three times, and it's worth noting that each ride was different - a different pilot, story, scene-scape, etc

If you like Meet & Greets but don't fancy the queues, hang around in the entrance area (after you've got your first Fast Pass) - there are tonnes of characters who pop out every half hour or so to have their photos taken with visitors.","Written February 26, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1296,Food,"It's a magical place.

Yes, it is expensive.

Yet, there are ways to save money once you have entered.

A big way to save money is on food.

The queue to buy even a hamburger is as long as it is to take a ride (pardon the pun).

I have had to wait for up to an hour (pardon the pun, again).

And, that hamburger will cost you in not only money, but also in patience.

Add a hungry young child into the equation, the Magic of Disney can become the Tragic of Disney.

So, how to save money on food and avoid any bitter memories you will try to overpaint with ""But, Splash Mountain was all the worth for it 'though, wasn't it?""

The answer...

Bring your own food.
Disneyland has a policy.
You can not bring in any food.
From a business point, this is great.
From a human point, this is not great.
Please follow...

1. There is a 'security check' before entry.
2. The 'checkers' are part-time.
3. The 'checkers' are part-time students.
4. They will check inside your bag.
5. Are they looking for W.O.M.D.?
6. No. They are looking for food.
7. Fast Forward...
8. I'll raise you by two rice balls & a banana.

It's true. Under the guise of security, they are looking for food.

Yet, they can not check your person.

So, two rice balls and a banana can go in your pockets.

They will only be able to ask ""Are you happy to see me? Or do you have...?""

This definitely came in handy, as it allowed us to secure a fastpass for Pooh's hunny hunt straight away. My advice would be, have a strategy for getting your fast passes and prioritise what rides you want to do. If you're only visiting for the day, this is the best way to see and do as many things as possible. If you come into the park without a plan, you will most likely be waiting in queues for most of the day.

TIP- During parades, the lines get quieter, so this is a good time to try and get on rides.

A lot of the seasonal entertainment will be mainly aimed at Japanese guests, but the Night parade is absolute MUST.

If you have more than one day, it will be easier to just look around without having to race to each ride. In general, I would plan on staying for the entire duration that the park is open, i.e.- 8:30am-10pm. It is a tiring day, but you can always stop for a rest and snack throughout the day.
Plenty of options for food, including some upscale restaurants such as The Blue Bayou and Crystal Palace.

Just that there is a particular eatery that need us to make a purchase before and we are able to sit down. They don't even let us settle our daughter on the table despite explaining that my daughter fell and need a rest while my husband buying and queuing for food.

We haven't been to other Disney sites but this place was quite pleasant to visit and accumulate my 10 km a day walk perambulating around the different rides, theatres and features. Once it hit about 1 pm the place was absolutely crowded and the wait for some rides got to 45-60 minutes but if you're in not in a tearing hurry there's always another turn to make and something to see or do. Food is palatable, there are attendants everywhere who were very generous and kind to us with directions and suggestions as we only had the one day to visit, and there are also plentiful bathrooms and even a smoking room. Had enormous fun riding in magic teacups and seeing my 15 year old teenager laugh like a child again and also shopping for takeaways is a pleasurable experience in itself.

1317,Amazing place but make sure to plan your visit!,"This is a quintessential Disneyland, with a wide mix of attractions and the atmosphere and theming you would expect from Disneyland parks. However, lines can be long, so make sure you make ample use of Fastpasses in order to cut the lines - the best thing to do is to get Fastpasses for the most popular rides, and use the time to fit in as many of the other, less popular (i.e. shorter wait) rides in between. The park might not be suitable for teens who are more interested in thrills as opposed to theming (the only major rollercoaster is Space Mountain). Also, almost every ride is in Japanese.","Written February 6, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

1321,Disneyland,"I havent been to the other ones so I cant compare but the Japanese sure loves Disney. There's families, couples, groups (both tourists and locals) whom would dress up as Princesses or have the matching Disney clothing. It created a friendly an fun atmosphere to the park.

The park is smaller yet still with fast passes we still missed some rides as esp towards the evening the lines could be over 1hr wait period. We missed all the parades (because of the long ride queues and saw them from the view of our line) and even the night light show. Im disappointed with that as they did announced that it wasnt going to show yet they still went ahead with it and so we were too late to get into a nice spot to view it. Tip- get in early to see the Night lights show at the castle. Its really breathtaking. I sadly had a side view with many heads and bushes.
Maybe its worth to visit the park over 2 days esp during a busy season and if your travelling with younger children. We stayed there from open til close and didnt get back to our hotel in Shinjiku until midnight. Though it would be very pricy esp to stay closer to Disney or purchase a 2 day pass. The rides were more catered for younger children. I dont think there was one which would cause a huge adrenaline rush. Its very family orientated and targeting younger children. Overall, we still loved Disney.","Written February 2, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

There are many similarities to the USA Disney experiences yet there are many differences. Most attractions are spoken in Japanese but the signage has several languages on them. The Winnie the Pooh ride was a new one for them and it was amazing. It had the feel of bumper cars and of being on a trampoline. An adult and children's ride for sure. The Main Street Cafe was a fabulous place for breakfast. The crowds were pretty thick in both parks. We spent only an evening at the Sea park side and could not ride all we wanted because of the lines. The weather wasn't too chilly except for one afternoon when we were leaving the park. We hope to make this a yearly experience!","Written February 1, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1324,Loved every minute of it!!,"We had the most amazing time at Tokyo Disneyland!

We bought our tickets at a travel ticket bureau (the one that sells train tickets and travel cards) so we could save ourselves queuing on the day - highly recommended to get tickets in advance!

We took the train which stops right outside the park and the entrance is a short walk. From the moment you step through the red arch, you hear Disney music and see small bronze statues on the fences. We managed to get through straight away with our tickets.

We didn't queue too long for rides. The longest wait was Space Mountain which was 45 minutes, but so worth it! We used the Fast Track option for Monsters Inc Ride & Go Seek and Big Thunder Mountain. The only issue with the Fast Track option is that you can only get a pass every two hours and the times may not be favourable. We used the Monsters Inc pass machine at around 11am and got a pass to go back at 6.30pm.

The only ride we didn't go on was Splash Mountain because it was 8 degrees that day - a little chilly to go on! A shame as this is the only ride that takes a photo of you on the ride.

We only saw one character throughout the park - a green soldier from Toy Story. Mickey and Minnie stand just after the park's main entrance, but there is quite a queue to meet them and have a photo taken.

We enjoyed everything in the park. The food outlets are very reasonable as are the souvenir shops. We also went to Westernland Picture Parlour where you are dressed up in Western clothing and you get your picture taken.

We stayed til around 8pm, so we managed to catch the light parade which was absolutely stunning.

Yes, it is mainly in Japanese, but we didn't seem to notice too much. Most of the staff speak English and can understand you a little.

The park was so incredibly neat and tidy as well - the staff work so hard to make this a dream day out!

Most of the restaurants we tried were booked out, so we ended up joining a 45minute queue for the House of Cards restaurant, which was extremely challenging with cold, hungry and tired toddlers. On a positive note, the kids really loved their day at Disneyland. We managed to squeeze in 18 attractions and 4 parades/shows! The queues for the actual rides were considerable but not as bad as we'd expected. All staff were amazing. We'd take the kids back when they're a bit older, but we'd definitely choose a weekday when it's less busy, and we'd also pre-book a restaurant......just to be able to sit down and relax for a bit!","Written January 22, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Best tip get fast passes tickets from online so you don't spend hours lining up... lots of fun to be had but it will take you all day to get around to most of the park and even then you will most likely miss some rides as it's always busy... everyone is polite so don't worry if you have young kids and worried about the volume of people and take a stroller to get around as the grounds are very big... if you have a stroller like a YoYo (fabulous traveling stroller only weights 5.5kg and folds up to carry and put up in over head lockers in plane) take it! If not best excuse to get one!

Lots of things to do for toddlers to adults...

If you can stay for the park closing lights parade it's definitely worth it.

Eating around the park is easy and best pic for restaurant is the queen of hearts in fantasyland. Food is better than all the snack food and it's very pretty inside.

Most loved ride is it's a small world

If you have girls make sure you go up inside Cinderella's castle as it's a princess paradise up there... have you pic taken sitting in her chair and try in the glass slipper. It's also the largest castle of all the Disneyland's.

Something we missed this time if you check the map there is a collectors area and you can buy visitor pins... these are great mementos of your visit and great if you get a special year celebration such as 15 years etc milestones and they are small to keep and can pass on to your kids kids I still have mine from over 15 years ago at Anaheim.

This year is a special anniversary if you can make it.

It's very easy to get to by train if you are not staying at the resort

In winter it's really cold down there as it's close to the water so make sure you take gloves scarf coat and have thermal layer on... we went in January and just got back from the snow and we were cold! But it wasn't windy just cold... we didn't really see Disney jumpers as we thought we would so best to be prepared make sure kids have plenty of warm clothes.

Check the map for rides that are closing this year to get to go on those!

As it gets dark earlier in the afternoon in winter make sure to check out toon town early so there plenty of light

Had a great time can't wait to go again!

There is a cream cheese like bagel you can get in Toon town that is really yummy to try

1342,Worth trying if you haven't experienced Disneyland before.,"Being from Australia I had never been to a Disneyland before, so during my trip to Japan it was the perfect opportunity to experience one for myself.

The scenery and gardens in this place were very impressive indeed. It was worth just spending a bit of time just to walk around and experience the level of detail that had gone into crafting the environment.

Probably the only negative I really have of this place is all the lines and crowds that you have to contend with. If you want to try out some of the popular rides and avoid lining up for hours to do so they have a ticketing system available that you can ""pre-order"" your place in the line with.

You will have to book these tickets in early as they will book out before long, but once you have these tickets you get given a time to come back to the rides, upon which you will pretty much get to the front of the queue straight away. Wish I had known this before coming as it would have been awesome to book our places in the queue while then having time to go and explore the park more.

Anyway to get back to a positive again, pretty much all the food in this park is awesome. If you see any food vendors scattered about and want to try things out I highly recommend it. Unlike from what I hear about the American Disneylands the food here was also quite reasonably priced and was usually Disney themed in some way.

Anyway I definitely recommend going here at least once. Just make sure you learn from my mistake and book your ride tickets early to avoid all the queuing up and you will maximise your experience.","Written January 18, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

The lines were super long for the rides except for the Merry Go Round and It's a Small World , which we rode. We stood in line for Pirates for about 25 minutes so that wasn't bad. The lines for the popcorn were crazy long. (But we did stand in line and tried the curry popcorn - yum). There was some language confusion at the ticket booth. I thought I was purchasing a one-day pass ticket for both DisneySea and Disneyland but when we were exiting Disneyland to go to DisneySea, I asked one of the staff and she looked at my ticket and said I only bought a pass for Disneyland.

The staff was friendly enough but the shows and the entire park experience is unashamedly tuned towards the female audience and hence my 4 year old got fidgety in a jiffy. I will admit that the castle is imposing and there are a lot ( and I really mean a lot compared to USJ) of things to do.

I'm guessing if you go first thing as soon as the park opens and on a weekday it would be quieter too! Food was ok, pretty average. The different popcorn flavoured stands were interesting.

Pirates of the Caribbean - a tad dark but not too scary
Mickey Mouse philharmonic - excellent!

1354,Crowded even mid-week,"First time visiting Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, overall it was awesome!! Been to DisneyLand and DisneyWorld many times in USA, and this was so similar yet so different at the same time.

The highlights:
- the AMAZING snacks including but not limited to: steamed shrimp buns shaped like mickey mouse, peculiar flavours of popcorn (curry, soy sauce etc), pizza spring rolls (our favourite)
- the classic Disney rides: Star Tours + Pirate of the Caribbean (both never had a long line for some reason), Space Mountain and Splash Mountain.
- the castle (even better than Disney World's castle)
- the Christmas decorations were stunning

Be warned:
- we went in what was meant to be 'off peak' Tuesday-Thursday in early December, the crowds were still crazy. Check the online crowd calendar before booking a trip. Fast passes for the popular rides like Monsters Inc and Winnie the Pooh were gone for the entire day within an hour or two of park opening.
- even during quiet periods, make sure you line up at the gate an hour before opening, I recommend getting a Monsters Inc Fastpass first then riding Winnie the Poo and Space Mountain straight away due to crowds!
- if you stay for the entire day you can get most attractions done in the theme park. We made the mistake of doing the two theme parks over 3 days. I recommend one day per park unless you have kids or your visiting during peak season
- Always know when the parades are scheduled and the route of the parades. At some point you WILL get STUCK in a particular area due to a parade. For some reason EVERYONE watches the parades. Once the parades start, you cannot get to the opposite side of the parade route for maybe 20-30 minutes. We almost couldn't use our fastpass for the Haunted Mansion even though we were 10 metres away from the ride (on the opposite side of the parade route).
- people don't wear ponchos on Splash Mountain, even in the middle of winter? (very different to Disney in USA)
- If you are staying at a hotel on the monorail, I recommend getting the multi-day monorail pass as you will find yourself using it a lot.
- There are large lockers outside of the park, suitable for our carry-on suitcase and backpack on our first day.
- The rides and shows are mainly in Japanese, no English subtitles.
- We COULD NOT USE OUR TRAVEL CARD to buy our tickets at the gate, international travellers, bring LOTS of cash. The only place to take out money on our Australian travel card was 7/11 ATM at Akihabara (Downtown Disney)

Food was excellent and service was admirable as the crew were efficient enough to serve us right away and even helped in carrying our food tray to an available table.

As crazy packed as it was, just living that childhood dream was an amazing feeling.
The castle that I see on every Disney movie I've seen was right in front of me.
The rides have long wait lines but that's to be expected. It's Disneyland!
All rides have ""fast pass"" however. You can actually fast track your wait times in line by attaining a fast pass (free and for the ride only) which allows you to venture off somewhere else and return to the ride at the allocated time.
DO NOT miss the light parade at night time. It was phenomenal! And the light display with fireworks over the castle was crazy cool.
Wait line for food was daily long but moved considerably well and was sooo yum! Far better than any of the warner bros parks on the Gold Coast.

I went there on 31 Dec, I'd day it was a good timing as most Japanese have gone back to their hometown to celebrate the new year (and the traffic was smooth too). I've tried 6 attractions within 7 hours using 2 times fastpass. Take note that you can use your park ticket to go to selected fastpass stations to get it, it'll provide a time range that you can come back for the attraction, you can use your extra time to queue for those attractions that don't provide fastpass. Rmb to check the fastpass as you'll be able to see when's the next time you can get another fastpass (and better go get the first fastpass when you enter).

The parade is a must watch, it blends all kinds of happiness no matter what's your age. You can reserve seats at the side of the parade route. The park and toilets are very clean, and is wheelchair friendly, you can even rent a Disney-themed wheelchair. Pets can be kept in their pet club. The staffs are very friendly too.

1373,A whole new look on Disney!,"We are HUGE disney world fans, and we were very excited to try a new Disney. We were only in Tokyo for a week, but the Disney parks were MUSTS for us!

Tokyo Disneyland is similar to Magic Kingdom, yet so so different. Rides include space mountain, pirates of the Caribbean (a better version), haunted mansion and splash mountain.

However, unlike magic kingdom, the park introduces new experiences. Such as Poohs Hunny Hunt (brilliant, would highly recommend), Monster Inc Hide and Go Seek (worth a fast pass) and a new Main Street (covered by a roof, and offers new and exciting shops).

Food wise, we ate at Crystal Palace, a Magic Kingdom favourite. This buffet offered a good selection of western food (as well as some non-western food) for a good price (for an all you can eat buffet).

Throughout the day, the park was quieter than the Florida equivalent (we went during low season however). Would recommend grabbing fast passes for rides such as Poohs Hunny Hunt, Monsters Inc and Space Mt.

Word of advice, fast pass is a must if you only have one day. Zipped past lines and knocked off around an hour of waiting on three rides at least. This allowed us to fit way more in. Food is expensive and not healthy but the sweet potato pastry things from one of the hut things was a yummy surprising treat. Don't throw your water bottles away as there are water fountains do fill up all over the park and it's hard to find water otherwise. Very clean and the cast members are so nice and helpful.

On the other side, I think it is so small with limited highlighted rides. That makes the waiting time unbearable 90+ minutes. You should go prepared that you won't be able to go to all the rides in one day. Simply because there is too much people for every ride. And the dilemma is it is not really worth it to visit it for 2 days!","Written December 30, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1377,Don't bother. Completely overcrowded.,"Disney cares more about packing them in than it does about providing a nice experience. Way too many people for the place to handle. They really need to cap You shouldn't have to wait 4.5 hours for any ride (with no fast passes available) nor should you have to wait 40 minutes to get a popcorn or 30 minutes to use a toilet. It was an extremely long wait for all the popular rides and even the kiddie ones had between a 30-75 minute wait. They need to manage the number of people they let into this place or add more bathrooms, restaurants, snack vendors and rides to balance things out. My advice would be to stick to the parks in the US. The ones in Japan pale in comparison and are a waste of time. Nothing unique about them except that they are vastly inferior when it comes to the overall experience. For whatever reason the locals don't seem to mind lining up for hours for everything. I wish Disney would refund me my money. My kids got on only three rides.","Written December 30, 2016",1.0 of 5 bubbles
1378,Visit in the spring,"Tokyo Disneyland follows the format of the other disneylands, that is a Main Street with shops, a magic castle and different lands going outwards. The biggest difference you notice on arrival is the Disney characters standing outside the park giving autographs and having your picture taken. On the day I chose to count there were 27 characters - you certainly feel the magic of the characters before you even have entered with the children getting very excited. Included were characters not often seen in this scenario.

Once in the next big diference is what the shops are selling. All the normal Disney clothing and souvenirs but... sweets and biscuits. I have never seen before or since so may Disney branded edibles. Apparently it is because taking presents home and to work features highly in the Japanese culture.

The rides were similar to the US, but the space was very different - loads of it and a long walk to the castle and the different lands.

I would only recommend doing this if you have lots of time in Tokyo or get there super early in the morning and get your fast passes early as they do shut around 2pm.

1384,Loved the Tokyo Disneyland and its Christmas parade!,"After reading so many gripes and complaints about the horrible long lines, my expectation on visiting tokyo disneyland is actually very low, specially since our visiting date is on December 22, few days away from Christmas. What a pleasant surprise it is that each ride took us less than 20 minutes (yes! less than 20 minutes EACH ride)! I was awestruck! Also, the food is decent albeit pricey. But that's expected.

Had a total of 6 rides for the day and didn't use any fast pass, including small world, pirates, and peter pan. For It's a small world, the 1st time we went there is literally no line! Wonder if we just lucked out or what. Longest line queuing we did was for peter pan flight and that took us less than 20 minutes! I was so amazed!

We had 2 kids with us and parents so by 5pm they are all tired already and suggested to leave, but if it were up to me, i would've stayed until closing time. The lines are definitely what made me so happy, it was fast and moving and completely nothing similar at all to what I've been reading. Cannot understand why is that since we visited on December, and even on a date close to Christmas! Maybe we are just lucky :)

Saw 2 parades, 1st is Disney Princess, 2nd is the Christmas Theme parade with Frozen and Beauty & the Beast. Very nice! Bathrooms are also well-maintained but this is standard in Japan anyway. The weather is perfect too- cold wind but sun is very bright. I did not wear my jacket until the evening as it's manageable. Skip the shops, not worth it. As for everything else, my advise is GO!

It is one of those pilgrimage when you are in Tokyo WITH kids/teens. Minus an hour max for sitting to eat - my legs have been working all day from 9am to 10pm. Even the most experience female shoppers need legs of steel to survive and complete Disney in one day.

Tips - Plan for weekday trips, buy tickets online and you must print out them out, go for fastpass machines first to get fastpass tickets, bring a floor mat if you intend to sit down & watch the parade

Nearest station is Maihama. After exit from station (south exit I think), turn right to Disneyland (turn left to Disneysea). Take a brief 7 mins walk (no covered shelter) to the Disneyland checkpoint (where they check your bags). Along the way, you will pass by a huge Disney store in case you miss out any souvenirs.

Remember to grab the theme park map and show attraction timing (same booklet) after you enter the attraction gates (after scanning the park tickets). The booklets are located on top of the exit/entry gates and it comes with Japanese/English/Chinese.

All show attractions are spoken in Japanese, but will include a few English conversations/songs. Probably due to Christmas season, they sold Turkey drumsticks as snacks along the street. Besides attractions, you can go for side adventure, popcorn hunting. There are six different types of popcorn over the theme park; Soy Sauce & Butter, Caramel, Curry, Salted, Milk Chocolate and Honey. Or you can go on medallion coins hunt. These medallion machines are located in restaurants and souvenir shops and they change the pictures of these medallions (¬•100) everyday.

Let me emphasize again, expect long lines, and that's for everything: attractions (90-180 minutes at least) , restaurants (varies, but about 60 minutes for the shortest wait), concession stands (60 minute wait for popcorn), and...yes restrooms (expect 30 minutes), picture with characters (an hour if you are lucky).

Weekends and holidays are absolutely chaotic. Avoid it you can. At times, the park will close admissions it the park gets too crowded.

As much as I like Tokyo Disneyland, it does attracts a lot of immature ""adults"" who would happily shove your 3 year old aside in line just to get a picture with Mickey.

1. Check the weather condition for your planning time. Avoid rainy time or bring rain coat or umvrella

2. Check the show and attraction schedule because sometime they have regurarly maitenance activity. Daily open time are different for every season

3. Entry the park in the morning and back home 10minutes before last show to avoid long Q for train or taxi if use public transportation

4. Get the map and show shedule to make the itinerary plan

5. Get lottery and fastpass as much as you xan to save your time and avoid long Q

6. Make restaurant reservation or take your lunch/dinner before/after lunch/dinner time to avoid long Q and limitation seat

- Very helpful Disney staff. For reviewers who encountered bad attitude from some, please do not assume all are Japanese. Even name tags can be deceiving. Besides, these reviewers should visit the parks in LA and Orlando to truly appreciate the staff in Tokyo.

- Very clean and well maintained grounds and toilets, despite the crowds.

- The dress-up and ambience: The Japs really kit up in Disney gear when they visit, grown-ups, teenagers alike. It really adds to the atmosphere.

Tip: Avoid the weekends and holidays to make your visit less stressful. Queuing hours for a two-five minute ride is no fun. But you already know this, yeah?","Written December 20, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1408,LOVED!,"We are seasoned disney world family and we just fell in love with tokyo disney ! the popcorn was amazing , the food overall was an experience on its own ! the park was extremely clean and the staff was so warm and friendly . the park does get crowded but if you go early and get fast pass you should be fine.","Written December 20, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1409,Recommended for family vacations,There are lots of restaurants and a big variety of food to choose from. There are plenty of rides as well and the majority of them are suitable for young children. There are many giftshops as well to buy souvenirs.,"Written December 20, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1410,1 day is not enough,"If you want to play all of the attractions, take pictures, 1 day is not enough. You need to spend at least 1 - 1 1/2 day.

Im was with my 11 years old son & 5 years old daughter. Disneyland is just perfect for them instead of Disney sea. They can play almost all the attraction. Waiting time during holiday season (in december) is still acceptable. From 10 minutes - 2 hours. For those with 1 hour ++, fast pass can be obtain. So no big deal about it.

They have various flavour of popcorn, so don't forget to try each of them. Each park has it's own theme & the popcorn also various according to the theme park. Exciting!

Food price is around 300 yen - 2000 yen. But it is not applicable for those food sold from the restaurant.

If you are muslim visitor, bring your own food & keep it inside storage locker. When it is lunch @ dinner time, the queue to the restaurant is super looonnnnggg! Don't waste time queuing up. Go out, take your lunch & eat it at the picnic area. So you can save your time.

In terms of drinking water. Just bring empty bottle. There is free drinking water inside which later you can topup inside your empty bottle.

If it's time to buy souvenir, just go the Grand Emporium. They have almost all the items. Easy.","Written December 19, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We are in Japan ! So we have to accept their culture and that's it ...
the park is super clean as well ...

Do not miss the parades ... specially the Xmas one and the electrical one ...

The fireworks is ok but little compared to Orlando ...

1414,"Good fun, but crowded at Christmas","My friends and I arrived at 9am the Sunday before Christmas, and we knew it would be crowded. However, we could only get one Fast Pass with a return time before the park closed (we got it as soon as we arrived, allowing us to go on Space Mountain at 12:30, but if we got any fast passes after that, the earliest return time was 9:30pm).

All other rides had a varying wait time from 15 minutes to over 2 hours. After getting some food, watching the day and night parade, we probably ride a total of 5 rides in 12 hours.

Still a lot of fun, but it was definitely crowded.

(And if you're going to go to a foreign theme park, don't be the stubborn foreigner and demand your native language or bring a credit card. Provide cash and at least learn some basic phrases, like ""please"", ""thank you"", and ""excuse me"". There were a lot of foreigners there that were the stereotypical ""I'm a foreigner, adapt for me! I'm your customer, bend over backwards to please me!"" kind of attitude, giving the foreigners who live here (like me and my friends) a bad impression.)","Written December 18, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1416,Poor staff attitude,"This is our second visit to Tokyo Disneyland. Overall, the rides are great. But the visit was marred by poor staff attitude. It is surprising that for an international chain, the staff speaks very poor English. Hence, it takes effort to understand what they are trying to say. It is frustrating when you asked them questions.

The other point to note is that they can be inconsistent in their answers. When we were standing at the side walk for the electric light show, we were told that the back row is only for standing. But when observed that other Japanese were sitting, I asked the staff why that is so, I was told patrons can either sit or stand!

The staff are also impatient when they have to converse with you in English. So don't expect the typical courteous Japanese service attitude. Will I visit this park again, unlikely. I will instead visit Disney Sea as I find the staff attitude and the rides in that park gives me a better overall experience.","Written December 17, 2016",2.0 of 5 bubbles

Upon arrival just trying to find the location where the tickets are sold was impossible. The lines just to get in were so long that the ticket booths were hidden. When I finally got in people were pushing and it was not relaxing, and at 8:15 people were already lining the streets for the parades so it was difficult to get any nice photos. One hour after the park opened every ride had over 100 minute wait. It was insane. All other Disney parks were so clean however this was not. Considering everything in Japan was super neat and tide this was disappointing.","Written December 17, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles

Disney sea is better, but Disneyland is exactly like Anaheim in CA, USA. Just not the same vibe of American culture and customer service - we preferred the US one better.

1422,Tokyo Disney excellent experience,"Except for the rain that day, had an excellent time at Tokyo Disney. The design of the different sections is laid out like Disneyland California so very easy to get around. Also, not as huge as Orlando. There are fewer attractions than California though, more spacing between rides, and attraction size is larger taking up more property. Found a little caf√© to eat in the Grande Bazaar which is similar to Main Street with shops and restaurants. Adventures of Winnie the Pooh has a fast pass option because it's really popular here. It is a 5 minute walk-on in California. Disney's Phillharmagic from Orlando is here, but was closed which would've been good on the rainy day. There is Bear Country Jamboree here, but slightly different. New Star Tours video had been installed by April 2016 when I visited. Rode twice and had different video playing each time. The train only goes between 2 lands instead of around the entire park. You have to pay a fee to take the monorail outside of the park to get to Disney Hotels & Disney Sea. There is no monorail inside the parks. There is a subway station on property for trains going back to Tokyo. Travel time from Tokyo is around 1hr. Tickets can be bought at Disney Stores for a discounted price or at the park. Also, at the subway station electronic ticket dispensers upon arrival on Disney property Cinderella's castle has displays and storybooks on Cinderella inside just like Disneyland used to have the Sleeping Beauty display inside the castle there. Jungle Cruise, Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain (not for rainy day), were much larger scale than Disneyland. Pirates of the Caribbean was closed at the time. There are also more shops and eateries than in some of the other Disney Parks. There is also a show after the fireworks show where portions of Disney classics are displayed on the castle along with background music. This was very well done and entertaining. Just remember all shows and parades are in the country's native language. Also, there are lines throughout the day. So try to come early to beat the crowds. Overall, I had a very enjoyable time at Tokyo Disney and would recommend visiting while in Japan.","Written December 13, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1423,Relatively short queues on a Tuesday,"We were there on a Tuesday and arrived about 45 mins before the park was open. The queues were long and became much longer while we waited to enter the park. It didn't take us long to enter the park after opening.

The first thing we did after entering the park is to get the fast pass for Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters and we managed to get the 1130 am slots. Then we went over to Monsters, Inc. Ride & Go Seek! and queued for about 15 mins for our first ride.

After the ride, we went to reserve table for our lunch at Restaurant Hokusai and got the 1:30 pm slot. Between reserving and having lunch, we managed to take two other rides (each about 5 minutes queue) and watched the Christmas Parade.

All together, we did 14 rides in Disneyland (including twice for Monster Inc). Our longest queue time is Monster Inc where we queued 45 minutes after 7 pm.

It's big but not too big. Everyone with babies would understand what I am saying.

The night firework is ""modified"" to be a light projection show on the sleeping beauty castle, which is very good as well.

Worth to stay in the Disney hotels (including partners hotel like Hilton, Sheraton, etc.) because lots of travelling time will be saved, and one need NOT to rush back home/ hotel in downtown.

When we first arrived we had sometime before we were able to book into our room (3pm is the allowed time). There is a restaurant there but it is buffet and very expensive. I would suggest that if you have some time before you are able to book in to go to the convenience store and buy pre-prepared meals from there. In hindsight it something that we should have done.

We had booked a 2 day pass to the main theme park and a half day pass for Disney sea. The wait times for most of the rides at Disney sea were quite long, but as the evening progressed the lines started to thin out. As we only had a few hours in Disney Sea we didn't get to do as much of it as we would have liked. The highlight though was the Indiana Jones ride.

We had two days at the main Disneyland park. We managed to get onto all the rides we wanted to. The highlight was the Star Wars ride. It was worth having the two day pass as we got to experience all of the rides we wanted to as we had the time. Also staying at the main hotel allowed us to have a break towards the evening and get some warmer clothes on and then go back to the park.

Cafe, Ice cream parlour, diners and restaurants were relatively small, it's hard to find tables and chairs if not seated restaurants.
The parades seemed Japan oriented, especially, in this summer, they did Japanese festival like parade that all the characters put on Japanese kimono and danced with Japanese instruments like drams and flutes. That was fun!

I would advise anyone who is planning to come to spend some time reading up on online Disney guides and blogs, they have some really useful information. Generally, if you have children below 10, Disneyland is a much better park compared to Disneysea.

Many iconic rides were available with a wait of 5-20 minutes. The longest we waited at a ride was 30. Get you fast passes for the popular rides. Another option would be to leave the park around 4-5 and come back before the parade at 7:30. After the parade, most people seemed to leave around 8:30, which was the best time to go on the rides. Also, try going to the popular rides during the parade ( which we saw last year, so we weren't so bummed we missed it). You have until 10 o'clock to go to the attractions. Even after 10pm, there seemed to be many people still in the shops.

The food was delicious. We ate curry and rice, teriyaki beef, and fries at one of the food courts. You don't need to buy water in Japan because most places offer free water. Cold Mickey Popsicles and ice cream was available for about 350 yen (about $3.50 US dollars, a little less).

The cute character buckets were all the craze! My daughter took home Olaf with salted popcorn and my son found R2D2 with butter and soy sauce flavored popcorn (sounds gross, but it tastes like eating hurricane popcorn). I wanted Dumbo, but that would've been excessive. Fans that served as a mist sprayer were available around the park, thankfully, since it was almost 90 degrees the day we went.

Although most Cast members spoke minimal English, my family and I were able to understand the gist of what they were saying. I wouldn't recommend going to the Stich attraction since it was interactive and in full Japanese. The shows are also in Japanese, which was why we didn't see many.

Disneyland Park was excellent, like all Disneyland parks. It has some of the classic rides we love like Star Tours, Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin, Thunder Mountain, Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain.

We liked Disneysea but found this park larger, a bit quieter and more spacious. It also had better restaurants and we loved the different popcorn; must have the caramel and milk chocolate popcorn!

They offer a 6pm ticket which isn't quite half price but a lot less and at 6pm droves of people came into the park for the night time fireworks, parades and rides. We found wait times pretty good with most things under an hour.

The staff were friendly and engaging. Just as Disneyland Orlando, the grounds are immaculate and the atmosphere is set by music throughout park. Our daughter loved it. Though there are shady parts it is open and on concrete so heat's an issue in the summer - bring healthy snacks (food was substandard and expensive) sunblock, hats, and patience as you wait for rides up to 50mins. Some attractions are only in Japanese (Stitch Encounter) and once in you're trapped till it's over. Intersperse the rides with seeing indoor attractions (Cpt Jack Sparrow or Haunted Castle) to keep cool and get off your feet.","Written July 4, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

They got tickets and they got some first passes, and took us to some attractions with no lines. My 79 year old mother came with us this time. She has difficulty walking. We rented a wheelchair. We also could park our car close to the gate because of her. All the staffs are very kind with big smile, not fake ones.

1465,Perfect Day at Tokyo Disneyland!,"After going to DisneySea on a rainy day, we go to Disneyland the following day and the weather is perfect. Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney park to be built outside the United States, and it opened on 15 April 1983. Tokyo Disneyland is owned by The Oriental Land Company, which licenses the theme from The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, are the only Disney parks not wholly or partly owned by the Walt Disney Company.
I bought tickets ahead of time online, so all I had to do was print them out and go straight to the entrance gate. We arrive Tokyo Disneyland an hour early, and there's already long lines forming at every entrance gate.
There many cast members holding signs an hour before opening to please walk, and not run. But so many people still run!
After we get our Fast Passes to Monsters Inc, our first ride is Space Mountian, and there's only a 5 minute wait!
After Space Mountin, we go on Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters.
We walk across and go on Thunder Mountain.
We walk by Snow White's Adventures and since the line was short, we hop on!
We use our Fast Passes to go on Monsters Inc. and walk to the front of the line.
Then, we go to the Haunted Mansion - only a 5 minute wait!
We go to Peter Pan's Flight, and the wait is 30 minutes, which is the longest wait we had.
Next up, It's a Small World!
Then, we ride Pinnochio's Daring Journey.
We then go to one of our classic favorite rides - Pirates of the Caribbean!
We decide to go on the Jungle Cruise since it was a short wait.
Tokyo Disney is known to have unique snacks. We try the popular Tipo Tortas! They are pastries shaped like churros, and filled with either chocolate, or caramel and custard.
So we got to ride 11 attractions all before 2pm!
We were so happy to be able to ride all the attractions we wanted to see.","Written June 28, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1467,Worth a visit,"Disneyland as we all know is about long long lines. This is unavoidable. Despite this we still had a great time. The star wars ride was a secret winner. There was a never a line, it was actually a lot of fun, and it allowed us to rest our tired feet for a little while lol. Be prepared to be confused in a lot of the ones aimed at younger kids, because obviously all the characters are speaking japanese lol still alot of fun though.

Be warned, we were stopped at the entrance gate and asked to cover up our tattoos so they ""didn't frighten the children"". It was a 35 degree day, and knowing that Japan is culturally not very ok with tattoos so we had made an effort to cover as much as possible but Disnelyland is very cautious. We were allowed through without further issue from staff once they inspected out tattoos to be sure nothing gang related/offensive.

1471,"Extremely fun, bigger than HK Disneyland","Went with my hubby and sister. My sister had planned to simply tag along and skip all the rides due to her motion sickness prob. I encouraged her to take her motion sickness pill half an hour before reaching Disneyland. :)

We had bought the Disneyland tickets online in advance in SG so when we arrived, we merely showed the printed slips that we had brought. Do book your tickets online as the entrance queue was very long even for us who did not need to buy the tickets there.

Once in Tokyo Disneyland, get your first fastpass attraction. Take note that after you have gotten the first fastpass, the timeslot of the next fastpass that you can take is printed on that fastpass that you are holding on to. Remember to return to the fastpass attraction within the timeslot stated on the fastpass ticket too, else you will have wasted all your time. (So there are two timeslots on the fastpass ticket that you have to be sure of).

After getting our first fastpass ticket, we went to sit for the simulator ride, Star Wars: The Adventures Continue. You should have a good back to take this ride as it shakes too much. Or, I advise you to stretch your legs all the way, rest the soles of your feet on the front metal in front of you, kind of like applying pressure to stabilise your sitting position when the ride shakes left right front back! This tip is what I gave my sis as she is shorter and could not place her feet on the ground when seated on the high seat. No problem for taller ones though.

Amazingly, I managed to get my sis to take all the rides except one. My hubby and I had thought that Big Thunder Mountain (Fastpass Attraction) was the scariest rides of all so we told sis to skip it. Turned out the ride was manageable with a lot of wind in our faces. :)

The scariest ride of all was Space Mountain (Fastpass attraction)! I almost wished for the ride to stop asap! It just went on and on for too long. Tears were brimming in my eyes (and I'm actually a thrill seeker and loves to go on roller coaster rides) and my heart was in my throat!! Came down from the ride wiping my tears! Poor sis got a big scare but after some ten minutes or so, we did say it was ultra fun! üëç

The Grand Circuit Raceway runs the car on designated track lines so we thought that it wouldn't be fun like Bumper cars and Go Kart. We were wrong, again! It was rather fast and fun!

There was a ride (could be 'Monsters Inc ride n seek!') which was really special as the seats could rotate even all the way upwards, meaning you lie flat on your back to face the ceiling deco and stuff. Isn't that cool?

You must also go queue for Country Bear Theatre! Even though it is only played in Japanese, one does not need to know the language to appreciate the beauty of the stage performance. I particularly liked it that the bears were not limited to their appearance on the stage itself. My advice is not to sit too front in the theatre. You would miss all the happenings in the centre of the theatre (special mention of the right wall and the ceiling!)

The Haunted House was a little scary as it was kind of life-like!

The Lucky Nuggets Cafe sells very affordable meals! After a filling lunch, we took Western River Railroad as we didn't want to puke on the thrill rides.

I bought a blue folded card holder secured with a button that also comes with a wristlet strap and a keychain ring. The cover is 3D reflective. Extremely beautiful! HK Disneyland does not sell this. I should have gotten at least a second one as all my friends love it too!

At one of those cafes, there was this character egg (shaped like an egg, with different Disney characters as the face of the egg) that contains a packet of M&Ms chocs. I was told that they were seasonal collectibles and that different cafes sell different character eggs! It is a nice and memorable collectible!

We enjoyed people watching - seeing the many young ""disney princesses"" school kids in school uniforms sporting Mickey and Minnie ears and adults in their sunday best with matching Micket tahirts and ears! I guess the happyness is realy infectious and soon you will be humming populat disney tunes when you hear them played throughout the park. As in Japan, food in the park is of high standard and everything - even the popcorn is great! Highly recommend trying all the flavours! Get one of the popcorn buckets in a disney character - we got R2-D2 and top up the flavours as you eat your way through! IMHO Milk Chocolate is the best! Ride queus are average 30 mins on a weekday but dont be put off - there are things to see whilst waiting - splash mountain / space mountain / big thunder mountain for the thrills - tea cups / dumbo / carousel for the kid in you - something for everyone! Atmosphere is really infectious! Staff are helpful and kind and if they are unable to assist you due to language barrier they will approach another who will be able to help!

Don't miss the Dreamlights parade at night it will blow your mind. Be sure to use fastpass because for a couple of rides you really need this, Splash Mountain is a must!

1477,The excitement is contagious!,"Let me start by saying I'm not a huge fan of Disney (yeah I know I'm weird). However we have been to Tokyo Disney twice with our young children and I loved it both times!

The lines can be very crowded as you can expect, but everything ran smoothly. Even when you park your pram there are attendants who kindly move it for you as people get off rides to ensure that space is efficiently used. Everyone is so excited to be here (compared to say Disneyland in LA) that you cannot help but get into the spirit of things.
The parades are absolutely fantastic and I recommend getting a spot about 20 mins in advance to get a good unobstructed view. We were there for about 10 hours and were exhausted but only went on a few rides.

Then there are new additions of Star Wars and Monster inc that makes the park even more interesting. A typical queue takes at least 30 minutes. The more popular ones may take up to a couple of hours. And of course, do make full use of your fast pass to get to the ride quicker.

We bought discount tickets at Family Mart convenience store prior to arriving which saved is quite a lot. Took the train to Maihama station.

The most popular ride was Monsters Inc so we got a fast pass at lunchtime but ended up not using it as it said to come back at 8:20pm. By 8pm there was not a long line.
Fast passes aren't really that fast! It was a weekday and not school holidays when we went. Not over crowded but still at least 30min wait for almost everything which is so boring for the kids and a shame to waste time standing in a line. That's the only negative...

We didn't get all of the park covered, so two days would have been better but we didn't have the extra time to come back this trip.

Kids loved the Star Wars attraction (2yr old not allowed tho), space mountain and it's a small world.

We stayed for the light show on the Disney castle which was good.

1488,Luck with timing = awesome visit and a new popcorn bucket collection,"Just back from Tokyo. Spent 6 nights at the Disneyland Hotel and 4 days visiting the two parks. These parks are very popular and we ended up going just after Japan's ""Golden Week"" ended. There are certain dates in Japan where more holiday time is taken by the population and crowds can soar. My spouse found a website that listed the typical ""crowd index"" on a daily and monthly basis and we picked days that were ""lower"" than the norm. And start really early with the ""fast pass"" routine - we looked at an ""ride wait"" app the day before our visit to see what rides were most popular and we made a beeline to that fastpass when the parked opened - and then went to wait in line at ""ride #2"" on our list. As soon as another FP became available off we went to get the next one on our ""long line"" list. Worked awesome - but, yep, those FP's are popular and will disappear as the day goes by.

The days we picked ended up also being overcast and raining - which we thought would hinder our enjoyment of the park. Not so - this park is well prepared for non-sunshine conditions. Main Street is covered by a glass roof structure and lots of rides are indoors.
It's hard to predict the weather so wear good waterproof shoes (Merrill makes great ones - though pricy - as does Sketchers), zip-off pants to convert pants to shorts, pack a light long sleeve layer, raincoat and umbrella. Sounds like a lot but I carried the family supplies in a single backpack. Nothing ""bulky"" - go lightweight. Or put the stuff in one of the many storage lockers available.

We ended up there in May 2016 and they were still celebrating ""Easter"". Which meant lots of colorful eggs and bunnies, etc. This doesn't seem to me as the typical ""USA Christian Easter"" type thing - it's more of a Japanese ""cherry blossom"" spring type of thing. We are AP holders for Disneyland CA so we covered TDL rides in one day. Yes, the fireworks were canceled. But the Castle show went on as scheduled.

We planned 2 days at each park and used day 2 at TDL to do the Easter Egg hunt. My genius spouse chose the ""Master"" level figuring this was a kids game. Yes, they have kid's games - this wasn't anywhere close to that. It was a riddle just like out of amazing race. But, in our case, we had 4 people and other ""hunters"" to tackle it. Still took us about 4 hours to find all the answers and we walked a good portion of the park again. Thankfully it was drizzling so it made the ""walkabout"" more of a ""walk"" than a workout.

If you are a Disney fan and have been to a DL park - Florida, California, Paris or Hong Kong then you can probably cover TDL in 1 day but if you can allocated 1.5 or 2 you will have time to relax and enjoy it more. We started with rides not available at DLC - my daughter was especially happy to find the canoe attraction open.

If you are a Disney shopping fanatic - well, don't go with high expectations. The majority of the merchandise, from what I observed, is ""food"" - as in cookies, cakes, soups, etc. We bought some to try and it was very good so we bought more to take home with us. This sure seemed like a more practical ""souvenir"" to take home but the thought of filling my luggage with ""food"" did have me thinking twice about which to buy. Obviously they have a lot of other ""stuff"" but the clothing didn't scream ""buy me"" to us and my desire to find a TDL backpack went unfulfilled.

Besides, it was very important for us to save luggage space for the popcorn buckets. OMG they are adorable and very popular. In fact, we bought most of the available character buckets on day 1 and rather than eating an overload of popcorn they offer vouchers that you can redeem on another day. We held off from buying more until I knew I could fit them in our luggage - yes, we planned for this - i packed a wheeled duffle bag inside one of our 3 pieces of luggage for just ""stuff"" we'd buy in Japan. Seemed like a good idea heading there... except soft luggage and souvenirs = broken stuff. So, we tried to put breakable stuff in extra padding but still ended up with one broken glass mug handle. Those dang ""extensions"" off main items always seem to end up broken.

After confirming we could fit more buckets we looked for them on day 2 - oops - couldn't find Donald Duck... yeah, that would be the one that had limited availability now... turns out they have a book of available buckets and where to find them. This was almost as much of a ""hunt"" as the Easter Egg thing. Some of the buckets didn't interest us but now I kind of regret not making room for Dumbo or buying DD when we had that chance. They also sell popcorn buckets in the store but you can't get a discounted refill if you buy them there. And don't count on them being there either. On our departure day we went back to the store and all the buckets were GONE. Oh boy was I glad I didn't make the spouse wait to get them.
All things considered - this was a fantastic visit and one I'd highly recommend. And, if you are there for a ""scavenger"" hunt - by all means give it a go - but only after you've been on all the rides you really wanted to hit.","Written May 15, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1490,A Fun Park For Family,"We were there as a family on a weekday and there is a huge crowd of people, mostly Japanese. It was drizzling almost the whole day but it did not dampen the spirit of the crowd using umbrella and raincoat to go round the park.
The parade still proceeded with the Disney characters in transparent rain coat even though the announcement said the performance is cancelled due to weather.
The queue for some of the ride took 45min to an hour. It is good to get a fast pass so that you only come in at a certain time and you don't have to wait for so long.
You can find food to eat easily but need to queue fro some of the restaurants.
The finale at 9.30 at night is a fantastic firework display followed by a 15 minutes of laser display show using the castle as the screen. An experience not to be missed.

I was lucky as the crowds were not bad. When I got there, the line was pretty long before I figured out it was the line to enter. I thought initially it was the line to get tickets. The line to buy a ticket was like 2 people. Getting in was pretty fast. Even with all the people out front, it did not feel full.

The park is really clean. They have their version of the penny machines which I started to pick up as cool little gift trinckets. They have seasonal and yearly ones. One thing I notied different is the lack of pins. One of my friends is a big pin collector and they do not have as many options. It was a little hard to find actual Tokyo Disney branded items. They do have a lot of t-shirts I was unfamiliar with. I usually do not but t-shirts bur prefer pins or magnets.

Fuming, I stormed off the queue and decided to get something else. Turkey leg came into my mind. So I went searching for the turkey leg stand and I was left flabbergasted by another super long queue. And so I gave up went to shop for souvenirs. Luckily the cashier queue wasn't as long.

1495,Patience Is A Virtue If Its A School Holiday,"A very helpful tip: check the Japanese school holidays before going or else you will be queueing for 2 hours in most (famous and thrill) rides. Yes you read it right, 2 hours which happened to us which will really exhaust your patience and will make you APPRECIATE the Japanese much more. You won't see a single face of disappointment on them. As a foreigner, its quite a virtue to muster and master. We ended up just touring the whole place with just two rides under our belt. If you're short on patience then follow my one and only (and very important) advice, (once again) check the school and national holidays. This applies to Disney Sea as well.","Written April 28, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1496,It's Disney but Japanese!,"It's like they picked up the Magic Kingdom and plonked it down in Japan. All the rides are the same (not a bad thing!!) but in Japanese. I don't think there were any Japan only rides in this park.
My favourite thing about Japan Disney was the food, they theme it sooo much better than in other countries. We had Mickey hand shaped bread buns, egg yolks in the shape of a Mickey head, Monsters Inc Mike shaped bread, Toy Story Alien buns. We ate way too much just trying everything.
The fast pass system works well, as we had a small child with us we mostly did the gentle rides and we never queued more than 15 minutes. When we arrived it said Star Tours had run out of fast passes which worried my husband but it only had 5 minute queues all day. We stayed until late and got in the big rides like Space Moutain then.
People start getting spots for the parade very early. On the maps it says it's not allowed until an hour before but especially for the electrical parade people started earlier. Be prepared to claim your spot early if you want a good one, people lay out mats and get comfy for a long wait. The fireworks weren't on when we visited due to heavy wind, it wasn't very windy at all though which made me wonder how often they got cancelled.

The rides are pretty good. Disneyland and Disneysea has a fast pass system where you could get these passes so that you beat the queue. Recommend that you plan which rides that you want to take and get these fast pass as early as possible. Typical by afternoon, the fast pass are all gone.

In our visit in April, we had to queue for around 30-45 minutes for the normal rides. The visitors ( mainly Japanese ) are all very nice & pleasant people. So even though we had to wait, the experience is not too bad after all.","Written April 24, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

This one was ridiculous though - so many people it was almost impossible to move, even in the big open spaces, the rides were all min 2 hour wait and the FastPasses all gone by the time we got there. Even the food stalls ad shows had crazy queues.

What's interesting was the website shows that today was only a moderately busy day, apparently it gets MUCH worse.

Managed to get on about 3 rides throughout the day, before giving up and heading back into Tokyo.

1502,Great fun,"I was dreading coming here. I thought it would be massively crowded and we would spend all our time waiting to get on rides. It was busy but very well run and so with a bit of planning you can do a huge amount.

A couple of important tips to get the most out of your day.

1) All tickets allow you to get fast passes without paying. You can claim 1 fast pass every 2 hours. So as soon as you get in get your fast pass for the busy rides and then do the same every 2 hours. By about 2 or 3 there are no more fast passes left so make the most of them. To claim a fast pass just go the machines and scan the bar code on you ticket.

2) The restaurants have massive waiting times. Reserve seats in advance to avoid having to wait for an hour to eat. The Lilo and Stitch Hawaian restaurant was really good for the young kids","Written April 14, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1503,Not as exciting as Disneyland Paris.,"This park is primarily for Japanese rather than foreign visitors. We were able to pay for and print our tickets before we left for our holiday and so we joined the correct queue at 7:45 and just before 8:30 we were in the park. With the ticket you can obtain a fast pass for free but do read the small print on the bottom as to when you can get your next fast pass, some say not before 15 minutes before the start time of your fp ticket, others are for later. You are doing well if you get 3 fast pass tickets in a day. Also some of the rides close the lines to any more queuing at lunchtime due to the high levels of people visiting. There's not enough restaurants and we queued up for a considerable time for them too. We also queued for 20minutes for popcorn, I have never queued up so much! As for the rides, space mountain here is tamer than Paris, the buzz lightyear is the same, Haunted house is a little different and I think less scary here. The star tours (star wars tour) is in Japanese. We went on Peter pan s flight, small world and snow white which were nice but not special or exciting. Overall the park felt dated and aimed at young children. There's too much emphasis on the merchandise and the shopping for Disney souvenirs. I spent the day here, the afternoon dragged but the electric parade at 7:30 was lovely, but I am happy to not have to Disneyland again.","Written April 11, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1504,Too crowded,"Went there end of March, too many people in the park. Long queues everywhere. I would suggest visiting during non peak season.

In general I find Paris Disneyland or Hong Kong Disneyland are better than this.","Written April 10, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1505,"If you plan in advance, it van be an awesome day!","I'm not a Disney fan. I like theme parks, but Disney just not my thing.

Taking this into account, saving that Disney Tokyo was a great experience has even more value. We spent the whole day there (advise 1, go 1 hour before they open), and we enjoyed 19 rides... It was just a great day!

But you need to plan in advance. Take into consideration that people there LOVES Disney, so you could end up waiting 4 hours to try that fancy ride everyone likes.

So, first thing before visiting... Plan your fast passes. Fast passes are something very smart that only this park has, and allows you to avoid some queues if you have an strategy. For me the 2 most important rides are Space Mountain and the Winnie the Pooh one. Run to space mountain to get the fast pass there and then go straight to Winnie's :)

Another tip! Food is not expensive here, so don't bother bringing good from outside because it's better to forget about bags and all this... Just enjoy the rides!","Written April 10, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

The rides are overhyped and boring. After a full day at Disneyland, I was honestly not impressed at all and wished there was more than one ride (the space mountain) that gave me some adrenalin whilst riding the ride.

Aside from all of that, the aesthetic appeal of the whole Disneyland did make me reminisce about all my childhood movies and memories. The iconic Disney castle that lit up so magically in the evening and outlined the night sky also the soft lights that lined the bushes on the pavements made the whole theme park extremely beautiful.","Written April 8, 2016",2.0 of 5 bubbles

1509,A little disappointed,"Took my 3 teens to Tokyo Disneyland and spent 2 full days there - 1 day each in Disneyland and DisneySea.

There's probably a few things Disneyland Tokyo could do to improve foreign tourists' experiences.

Firstly, improve the entry into the resort. Not enough gates and their scanners don't work very well. It took us 45 minutes to get through the entrance despite being there 20 minutes before the gates opened (8am). Every queue was about 100m long 20 metres wide across. They could look no further than Universal Studio in Osaka where the entry was smooth and efficient with a small queue at opening times;
Secondly, they need to improve their FastPass system. A 2 hour wait for the next available FastPass does not make the cut considering the entry fee and the wait times for some of the rides. The waiting time for the Flying Dinosaur ride was 500 minutes, which is absurd. The average waiting time for a popular ride was between 150 to 180mins. Maybe selling the FastPass and restrict the number of FastPass a day for the rides could be a solution. Again - look no further than Universal Studios;
Thirdly, remember it's not just about Japanese visitors. There are foreign tourists at the park. It's not too difficult to have English subtitles (translations) for the rides to make the experience more enjoyable.

Overall an enjoyable first time experience. Would rather spend my money in US Disneyland next time.","Written April 5, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles

Armed with rain poncho's, I was looking forward to my lunch. Have been looking all over the internet and was really excited for ""Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall"".

+ the atmosphere was amazing (Japanese don't joke around going to Disney, 99 out of a 100 Japanese are dressed as a princess or is wearing a Disney hat).
+ they had all sorts of popcorn baskets (flying Olaf, big Mickey underpants etc) and popcorn in different flavours
+ everybody stands in line to take pictures at certain places so nobody is standing in your picture
+ the interior of ""Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall"" is absolutely stunning and worth going to Disneyland
+ we saw a lot of Disney figures walking around the park. With a little patience, you'll be able to get a picture with them.

Tips:
- because of the rain we didn't see any parades
- no fireworks
- rain ain't fun
- they hardly speak English
- check if your hotel has a free Disney shuttle bus (Keio Plaza Hotel in Shinjuku did and brings you back straight to the hotel so no public transport is needed)","Written April 2, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

We waited on average 2-3 hours for rides, 45 minutes for food, and around 30 minutes to use a toilet. The park became incredibly cramped towards the middle of the day as to be expected. If you're happy to spend most of your day waiting in queues this is the place for you, if you're not, find another place to go. On a positive note the food was well priced and the staff were quite friendly.

Some of the parades were rained off but we saw my husbands favourite (Electrical Light Parade) which was as impressive as ever.

This was very busy considering it was mid March and was also raining a lot throughout the day. Thing that surprised us most was how long the queues were to every single ride -even the less popular rides were still at least a 20 minute line, with the most popular rides in excess of 2 hours! You really need to get there at its 8am opening time and stay until it's 10pm closing time to have any chance in getting on all the main rides. You just have to be very patient for the long waiting times in between getting the fast pass tickets. Very little English spoken but this actually appealed to us to experience the difference between parks in HK, Paris and USA. If however you only want to hear English then this is not the park for you. As with all Disney parks it's very colourful and the light parade is a fantastic sight to see. If they could somehow manage to reduce the queue lines to everything - toilets/restaurants/food kiosks (not just the rides), then this park would have received a higher rating.

If you want to experience what late 80's Eastern Soviet Union was like when many waited in bread lines, then by all means go.

1520,Great Experience,"Recently jetted off to experience Disneyland in Tokyo. I visited both the Disneyland Park as well as the Disney Sea park. I think this is just for Disneyland so I will stick with just this park to begin. I was a little sad as a few attractions were closed (but this happens at all parks no matter what so they can keep them running in top notch performance, so I understood). Pirates of the Caribbean and Its a Small world were closed so we started with the Jungle Cruise. In pure Disney fashion, it was the same (for the most part). Some of the parts were different, but the driver/guide were funny as always and did a great job (even though I couldnt understand what they were saying). We went at night which makes it even better. One thing that I liked a lot better then in the USA is that they added fog, so at night this made it very spooky which I enjoyed!

After the Jungle Cruise, we went right over to Big Thunder Mountain and got in line. This ride was great and quite a bit different then in the US but the same concept. They have done a great job to make the rides similar with a few changes to make it new.

Splash Mountain was the only ride offering ""Single Rider"" so we buzzed over next to get on that, and we only had to wait about 10 minutes before boarding. One thing that surprised me was the lack of ""splashes"" that you get in FL and CA. When you go down the shorter water falls, you seem to end up on a platform that catches you without splashing you.. which was kind of a nice surprise in the chilly evening.

The Haunted Mansion was very similar but once again with changes that made it fun. The outside resembled the mansion at WDW.

We also went on the teacups and that was about it, as lines were horrible. We got some food and tried to enjoy the fireworks but they didn't seem to go at the advertised times, but got a view when we were at dinner.

We tried to do Disneyland and Disney Sea all in one day, which is totally possible, but tight.

Lines at these parks are way worst then in the USA and Fast Passes were very hard to get. Space Mountain was a 300 minute wait, and we couldnt justify waiting in that line when only here for a half day... as we wouldn't be able to go on anything else, so much to our dismay we had to skip it.

There are seven themed areas in the park:- the World Bazaar, the four classic Disney lands ( Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland), and two mini-lands (Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown). Most of the rides and games also mirrored after those in the original Disneyland as they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. Most of the rides had really long queues even on a Monday so we tried to get quick passes to certain rides and queued for the rest. There have many of finger foods to keep you occupied, all of them had long queues!

You can find the map in the website so you can plan everything before your visit. But when you enter the park, don't forget to take the map so you can see which attraction that you want to ride first. Take few of it, in case you lose it or because it's wet due to the rain. Ask the staffs! The staffs were friendly. Even you cant speak Japanese, show them where you want to go in the map, and they'll direct you.

From the moment you get on the bus to take
you to monorail that runs around the 2 parks, you are but with smiles, Disney images & music from the movies. It all starts before you get in the park.

We went in a rather busy day, so we made good use of the fast pass system. You use these ticket vending machines to reserve your place on a ride. Sometimes an hour or 3 later. But you do other stuff in the meantime.

Star Wars, Monsters Inc, Space Mountain, river boats, singing bears - it's all good.

But the big surprise? The God Damn Parades. I didn't think I would enjoy, but ya just gotta do it.

1535,Happiest Place On Earth...if you like waiting in line,"Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from Tokyo, there was a place where you could wait in line for hours and hours on end and maybe just maybe get on a ride. You can even queue an hour for a turkey leg (which was my personal highlight of Disneyland). By the end of the day everyone's legs were weary and patience grew thin. Thankfully the line to get out isn't to bad.
The End.","Written January 5, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1536,Disneyland Tokyo,"This place completes my global Disneyland resorts globally.

Japan has 2 Disney parks. Disneyland and Disney Sea (unique). Both of these resorts are worth visiting.

If you have been to the rest of the Disneyland (Paris, Hong Kong, Anaheim, Disneyland Florida) , then Tokyo Disneyland is pretty much similar (in terms of the rides).

What differentiate the Tokyo Disneyland from the other Disneyland are its parade, souvenirs and performances. There are 3 parades in a day! lots of unique and cute souvenirs (that you cannot find in the rest of the Disneyland), their 'live' performance.

For the parades, the crowd starts 'reserving' seats 45 mins prior to Parade itself. They lay mats on the floor and await patiently for it to pass. So if you want good seats, you need to join them.

The souvenirs, well you need to be there to see it, I'm sure you will bring at least a bagful home. Their souvenir popcorn buckets are one of a kind and really cute, I brought 3 home from this trip! There are about 6 to 7 flavor to choose from, so you may like to walk the park and look out for the popcorn stands!

The performances, carry the distinct signature of Disney. It's fun, entertaining, brightly lit and great fun for the family. However it's in Japanese. But we still had fun.

A few tips.
The Japanese love their Disneyland. Although the doors open at 0900hrs, the queues were already swarming at 0800hrs, easily, 500 to 600 pax were there lining up waiting for the doors to open. Fast Passes are available for the major rides, but they are mostly given out by noon. So be early.

Upon your admission to the park, there is an area in ""Tomorrowland"" next to ""Space Mountain"" where you could try your luck in obtaining seats for the night performance. Use your ticket ""like fast pass"" and if you are lucky, you will get premium seats allocated for the night firework performance. This is Free.

One point to note is that most stuff are in Japanese, do have a little patience and seek help. The service staff are very helpful. The night firework is beautiful, so do stay till the very end.","Written January 3, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Many shops many restaurants many activities all in with same theme ""DISNEY"". it was one of the wonderful experience of me. I hope next time I will go to Disney Sea, just near to same place.

Nonetheless, the queuing time isnt as short as we hoped. hahaha..... You probably can get 4-5 rides depending on the length of queue and probably you wouldnt want to spurge on a fast pass.

1539,Fun day but no LA,"We had a really fun day out here - but I think the finesse and attention to detail is a little higher at the US versions. Everything was well presented, neat, tidy and has that Disney feel, but there was something just a little lacking, in my opinion, in comparison to the likes of Disneyland and Magic Kingdom.

The evening fireworks were underwhelming, but the show afterwards with the images displayed on the castle (all audio in Japanese, of course :) ) was stunning and well worth staying for and more than made up for the lacklustre fireworks. I guess the evening firework show at Disneyland is its ""signature"" evening show, where for Tokyo Disneyland its ""signature"" evening show is the projection on the castle.","Written December 30, 2015",4.0 of 5 bubbles

I saw a baby girl with her mother and I gave them the 2 extra tickets I had but at first the guards did not allow it. So I had to ask my friend to secretly hand it to the mother outside as I really pity the child seeing her so excited to see the fireworks and thank God it works! The fireworks display was fantastic!

1544,First and last visit,"We spent an evening at Disneyland on the first night of arrival and a full day each at Disneysea and Disneyland. Whilst both were beautiful parks with attention to detail, it was overrun with local teens and young couples on dates on the quest for the best selfies. They contribute to the colossal queues on popular rides up to 2-3 hours wait time making it really hard if you have little ones in tow who neither have the patience or stamina. I'm sure being the holiday season doesn't help so I would avoid during this time of year. Even with 8-10 hours each day we missed on a fair few attractions

Get there early! We arrived at 8am on both days and there were large crowds already. Workout your Fastpast tickets. There are limits to how many you can get and when you can get them. Free but sell out fast!!!!! My husband would run off and get them while the kids and I went to another attraction. We lucked out on must-see-for-kids Toy Story Mania and Monsters Inc with 2 hour waits by mid morning and sold out fast past tickets. Disappointing!!!!

Everything is in Japanese which I found really off putting. I've only just learnt from a fellow reviewer that there is a translation tool you can get to help subtitle. I wished I'd known earlier but my 5yo can't quite read yet.

Disneysea was unlike anything I'd ever seen. Being a designer and an event stylist, the sets and scene were stunning. From the moment you walk in there's the Mediterranean Harbour with a fortress and ship my kids loved exploring.

I'm 41 and my fave character is the little mermaid so the mermaid lagoon was stunning.. My young kids loved it. We got there early so they got on all the rides with ease. The rides are suitable for toddlers. There's even a playgym.

Must ride at Disneyland- Splash Mountain at Critter Country. It's new so I assume updated from what you would have seen at Anaheim.

Food and beverage selections were average and limited. There are popular flavored popcorn stands. You can get these refillable take home popcorn tubs. They are character themed. I was after the rare R2D2 unit but of course it sold out. This is the one to covet!!!

Workout your souvenirs early on. By closing time, it's a mess - total bedlam.

I'm unsure if I will ever be back. It wasn't as great an experience I had hoped.

Wear comfy shoes because it'll be a long, long day. I've seen the ever-so-vain Jap girls in ridiculous platforms. Happy queuing!!!","Written December 25, 2015",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1545,Always magical to visit Disneyland,"Although as the children gets older, the rides and attractions are less interesting to them, Disney still retains its magical feel and touch to make anyone in the park very much an excited child. Despite the fact that the shows and rides were also spoken in Japanese, we learned on this trip that we could take a portable translator tool that help us subtitled the content of the shows (apparently, not many people are aware of this since I only saw my son carrying this device and everyone marveling at the tool including the Japanese!). With two families in tow, the one who extracted the best value for the theme park was my 6 year old since the older kids generally only took the so called ""scarier"" rides only. Magical show at the night over the castle and all round tired when the park closed at 10pm. Worth a visit every time regardless of age.","Written December 22, 2015",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1546,Still the happiest place on earth,"Well so to speak. There are other Disney parks around the world but this is the nearest to me in terms of accessibility. You can never go wrong with Disney I guess. Still there is some room for improvement with regards to lines and queueing. Their fast pass is just an adjustment for you to come back at a different time. Maybe a similar style like universal studios Japan wherein you have to pay extra to get thru faster via an express lane. I wouldn't mind paying extra on top of the entrance pass fee as long as I don't have to keep falling in line for a fastpass then again at the fast pass lane cuz a lot also got it.

Still, no complaints. Just don't go on a weekend here. It's pandemonium. But on a weekday, it's manageable. One piece of advice....... Go early. As in opening of gates. Merry Christmas everyone!","Written December 20, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

1550,3 days in both parks with two girls aged 4 and 6,"My husband and I waited long until going to a Disneypark with our kids. We wanted them to be old enough to remember and cherish the memory.
Since we are currently living in Taiwan, we had to choose between Hongkong and Tokyo. Lot's of people recommended Tokyo over Hongkong because of it's exceptional cleanness.
We did not make the wrong decision!
We booked the tickets online first. One day Disneyland, one day Disney Sea, third day we were able to choose one from both.

Access is very convenient if staying inside Disney Resort. The Monorail takes you directly to the park entrances.

The parks are crowded, yes. But thst is the case anywhere in the world. Due to the possibility of getting Fastpasses for certain attractions, it is very well organized.

The food offered at both parks is reasonably priced and very wide ranged.

With little kids, we preferred the Disneyland. Disney Sea's attractions are mostly suitable for older kids from, I would say, 12 years of age. It is still beautiful to see though.
So we spent two of our three days st Disneyland and enjoyed our trip a lot!

Managed to go to 14 attractions (rides/shows etc). Average waiting time is 35min. With fast pass, is much shorter timing. Hence, those attractions showing shorter duration, Some show waiting time is 5min, need not queue for long. Went on board Mark Twain Riverboat at night, was cold weather but great view. Went twice to the Pirates of the Caribbean. Many rides are very family and children oriented.if you are looking for very excitng, extremely high speed, challenging long duration roller coaster, unlikely to find. Restaurants are packed especially during meal time. We went after 2pm to Tomorrow Land Terrance and had Mickey bread sandwiches, managed to get seats. The parades are very intriguing and colorful.

Since I went there during weekend, the park was very crowded with families. We need to queue for 1-2 hours per game, but it didn't matter for me.

Take a train and you will be able to follow the crowds to the entry. You are able to pre purchase tickets (which is recommended) from any Disney store. I purchased mine for the Disney store in Shinjuku the day before. Ride lines get excessively big after 11, so jump on as many as you can in the morning! If you are after thrill rides this is not the attraction park for you, rides are generally bag friendly and young child friendly. Only one roller coaster was open when I went and it wasn't the greatest. The coolest ride (I think)that is in offer is the Monsters Inc. ride which you can purchase a photo from. The parades are cute to watch but crowds build quickly, with people sitting on matts awaiting the start time (which can be done an hour in advance). There are an excessive amount of souvenirs on offer and are fairly priced. The best snack to purchase is one of the many varieties of flavoured popcorn on offer!

However, even many of the ""kids' rides"" are quite impressive and the fireworks + video/light show projected on the castle walls in the evening are worth seeing.

The lines were not as bad as we expected, as we only had a longer wait to Splash Mountain (about 90 minutes). We got in to most attractions in 20-30 minutes. I'm reducing one point due to the Fastpass queue skipping thing, because it really annoyed of us (and many other in the long line of Splash Mountain, as well).

Unsurprisingly, a day trip to the Disneyland costs almost a small fortune, but this is to be expected. Extra points for the superior staff, who were smiling the whole day, even though working long days at an attraction park is not always the easiest.

If you're bringing a family the kids will definitely love it, many things to do but be warned waiting in line for some of the rides could take up to at least 30mins+ as there are these types of signs around warning you the minimum wait time.

Unlike other Disneylands, don't expect people to speak English well. We spoke good Japanese so we were fine, but I can imagine this being a problem with others.

1568,Good Park NOT Crowd,"Tokyo Disneyland Park is two adjacent parks, much like the ones in California. Tokyo Disneyland is much like the classic parks most are familiar with. We only spent a day in each park so we didn't experience every attraction. Many of the attractions are the same as the parks in the US, Haunted Mansion is very much like the one in California, except I'm fairly sure they don't add the Nightmare Before Christmas figures. There is a beautiful big Alice in Wonderland themed restaurant called Queen of Hearts. Jungle Cruise is definitely advanced over the ones in the USA, there are some new figures, underwater explosions, fire and a part with a Mayan cave w projections of crawling bugs similar to Indiana Jones. Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt was one of the true treasures, I don't really like the one in California but this one is very advanced. This attraction uses magnetic cars so there is no track, early in the ride your car does a kind of square dance with the other cars. there are lots of animated figures, and at one point you are in a room with a very wide screen and the scenery is projected to give you the sensation of moving up and down. We also rode Monsters inc, Pirates (we walked right on), Mickey Philharmagic, Star tours; all these were much like there US counterparts and all had little or no waits. A big attraction of this park are the stands selling various flavors of popcorn, each stand has it's own unique flavor, like near the Winnie pooh ride they sell honey flavored popcorn. The parade was called Happiness is Here and the nighttime spectacular was Once Upon A Time: a show of projections on the castle and synchronized fireworks.

Crew members greet you with big smiles and welcome you to the magical world of Disney. Throughout my time in Tokyo Disneyland, I couldn't fault it one bit. The whole environment is amazing, super clean and well organised. The rides are very well maintained and the characters that come out to meet you are spectacular - each one truly imbibes the characteristics of the characters themselves and you can't help but fall in love with Disney all over again!

The parades are very popular with the regulars at Disneyland and Sea so make sure you get there at least 30-45 minutes before if you want to get good seating spots (earlier if you want the best!). Make sure that at least one member of your party keeps your spot while maybe the rest can go and scout for food etc.

It's best if you're able to familiarise yourself with the map and also plan Fast Passes if you're wanting to get in as much as possible. We went on a weekday and it was thoroughly packed out. There was barely space to walk so make sure you are efficient with time!

Disney characters as I mentioned earlier are very friendly - the less famous ones (Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy tend to have long queues) are easier to take pictures with. All you need to do is to get their attention but be polite!
Overall, enjoy all that Disney has to offer and make sure you don't miss out on the awesome snacks. There are loads of great Tokyo Disney Resort websites you can refer to if you need tips.

No matter how old you are. Absolutely incredible when you step into Disneyland. You will feel like a child again.
One day is not enough at all, because there really is so much things to do and see it's better if you get the 2 day pass or more.
Attractions: There are a lot of rides and entertainment shows for different age groups. Some people might say, it's extremely crowded and the queue were long for the popular rides at least 30 min. If you have FastPass is well worth it. Save so much time.
Parades/show/Disney Characters Greetings: were absolutely lovely,fantastic and enjoyable to see the magic of Disney.
Restaurant: can be long queue to waiting at peak time, so you can pre booking online as same the date you buy the ticket online.
Staff: Friendly,Politely and Helpful.

***Pre-planning to save your times.
- Check first in a crowd calendar available online the day,atmosphere.
- Good time to visit is come during weekdays. Avoided weekend and public holidays.
- Booking online Disney 's eTicket and FastPass is very useful. Printing at home and go directly to the gate.
- check a map. What kind of ride that you really want to do and see. ( you can't see everything in 1 day )
- Staying in hotel which is located right in front of the park is also an advantage, so that you can come to the park or back to the hotel anytime as you want.
- Lot of walking, wear comfortable shoes.
- Stroller and wheelchair available for rental. In case for kids or older getting tried of walking.
- If you plan to visit the park and after that you are planning to go to the airport directly. There is also have storage lockers of all sizes so that you can keep your belongings.
- Leave the park early before closure time because the bus,the train station can be extremely crowd.

1578,"Disney magic, Japanese style","The resort is at very easy reach from Tokyo center. Attractions are very good, but expect some long lines, especially for the most popular ones (for adults). Make sure you use the Fast Pass tool to skip some of the lines, otherwise expect at least 30/45 minutes wait for each ride. We went on an ordinary tuesday of october, bought tickets online the night before and went straight in. Lines were ok, but we did not use any of the hit attractions, as we were with a 4 years old and a toddler.
Cast members speak very little Japanese, so beware. Food is not excessively priced, but expect lines for that too, so you may be better off to bring some snacks from home.","Written October 11, 2015",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1579,Better than the original in L.A.,We've been several times to the Disneyland in L.A. and Disneyworld in Orlando. This was our first visit to the Tokyo version. Best for kids age of about 6 to 14. We really liked the Disney Sea park themed uniquely so and only found in Tokyo. Crowds are ridiculous during weekends and holidays. Mid-week crowds were very tame. Customer service is excellent. Hotels are pretty expensive but the admission ticket is less than what you'd spend in the U.S. Food is ok - priced ok. Skip the 'pottage corn' flavored pop corn unless you like the taste of powdered creamed corn put onto popcorn.

1582,Amazing Disney Experience,"We recently visited Tokyo Disneyland with our 3 year old and our 8 month old, and had the most incredible experience. We had 3-day Magic Passports, and visited the park on Day 2 & 3, as it seemed to resonate with the 3 year old more so than DisneySea. If I had to sum up our experience in one word, it would be ""Magical"". Our 3 year old was able to ride a lot of the attractions - and we were pleasantly surprised that the queues for the smaller attractions were not all that long, especially on Day 3 when it was raining. FastPasses made the bigger attractions more achievable with 2 small children in tow - we used these to ride Monsters Inc, Splash Mountain, Star Tours and Pooh's Hunny Hunt at various times.
One thing to note, is that this park is almost entirely in Japanese. All the voiceovers on the rides are in Japanese, as are the shows. Also, there are very few cast members that speak more than minimal English - this only proved to be an issue when we had a problem on one of the attractions. After our whole family rode Pooh's Hunny Hunt on our first day at Disneyland, we enjoyed it so much, that we went to get FastPasses for it on the next day. We were clear that the restriction states that babies must be able to sit unassisted on a moving object - which we were certain that our 8 month old could do, and indeed there was no issue with him riding the first day. However, on the second day, once we were loaded onto the ride (my mum and the 3 year old in front, and my husband, the baby and I at the back), they asked my husband and I to lift up our hands to show that the baby was sitting unassisted - which he was. We got to the final safety check and the cast members motioned for my husband, baby and I to get off the ride...which we did, but with no explanation from the cast members and then the ride went off with my mum and toddler still on board. NOBODY at the ride could explain to us why we were taken off the ride. We got palmed off from one cast member to the next. Eventually we left to go meet up with my mum and toddler, which was a mission in itself, as they had finished the ride and had no idea where we were. We visited the Information centre, where an English speaking cast member was really helpful and contacted the ride and explained to us that babies riding is at the cast members' discretion, and they were being stricter today than they were yesterday, and that none of the cast members had actually understood us when we told them that the baby had gone on yesterday. I am ALL for safety on these things - my issue is NOT with our baby having not been allowed to ride - rather, I am thankful that we had FastPasses and didn't wait 90 minutes in line for this to happen. My feedback to the cast member is that if they are going to screen and safety check, this needs to happen much earlier in the process of lining up. My other issue is that they separated our party without any explanation at the time. Having said all of this, this was not enough to really detract from our days at Disneyland - we had an incredible family holiday, despite one disappointing incident.
The park itself is accessible by public transport, and the monorail from the nearby hotels (where we stayed) makes it super easy to take breaks throughout the day when travelling with young children. We felt that food and merchandise was really well priced compared to other theme parks that we have been to - and there is a shopping centre near by for more food options.","Written October 5, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The best part about Tokyo Disneyland is that it is huge and it will take you from opening hour till night to finish it all. The park is quite dated but it is still refreshing especially the new Star Wars ride.

The popcorn was great with multiple choice like Japanese soy sauce and curry flavor. We basically went hunting for all the flavors. Something to ponder is that the queues can be overwhelming, especially during winter. Most of the lines started from open area, it means you will be freezing for most of the time.

Always love the parade especially the fireworks, and it is worth every disneyland visit. Make sure to have the best sit/stand position to really enjoy it, I prefer to stand a bit far from the path to take the pictures.

The park is old, however to compare to the new Disneyland Hong Kong, I could say it is much better. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food at the Blue Bayou is delicious.

Go as early as you can and join the queues. Take note of the newest or most popular rides and make a dash for it to get the fastpass ticket.

Well we arrived early, but not early enough, how many people were in front of us, well I don't know but it was in the tens of thousands without a doubt.
Being Japanese they were all having a great time queueing, it's an experience in itself apparently. And queueing was certainly the theme of the day.
While everybody rushed to what ever the newest ride was, we snuck off in the other direction and jumped on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, after only a 15 minute wait. The shortest of the day.
Eh, it was ok.
Anyway I followed the missus around, took some snapshots, stood in lots of lines, and popped a few aspirin.
Oh the lines, a three hour wait for the rides, there were even hour queues at the popcorn vendors.
The locals take it all in their stride, me I chose to forgo most rides a skip the popcorn altogether.
It's Disney World, I guess it's exactly what you expect and very much influenced by the preconceived notions you have before going in.

Have an attraction-plan ready(like us) if you plan to ride all rides! We high-tailed to Monsters Inc first and worked our way around which worked for us and got most of the rides and shows. Utilised 3 of the fast-pass machines (Pooh's Hunt, Splash Mountain & Space Mountain). The whole park was always in a clean condition and the staff were very helpful. Average queue time for the popular rides got up to 40min. Food choices was good and prices are expected to be around AUD$15/dish as per theme park prices.

1607,Recommend you plan your visit,"This is the perspective of a 50 something year old woman.i visited with my 21year old son and 40 something Japanese friend..

This was my third visit to Tokyo Disneyland.I went on Monday the 22nd of June,the second last day of the Easter (! in June) theming with beautiful decorations and a wonderful full scale Easter Parade as well as the Happiness is Here parade.

I highly recommend pre-planning and looking up crowd predictions,opening hours,show times,temporary closures,attractions and restaurant options so that you can prioritise what you want to do and make the most of fastpasses.One day isn't enough to see everything!

I really enjoy the parades and the shows.The Dreamlights Show in the evening is a standout with magical lit up floats.

The night show with laser projections on the castle is spectacular.There is a lottery to win prime viewing spots with seating but in three visits I have had no luck winning seats.

I highly recommend the shows too.I don't speak Japanese but I find the familiar songs sung in Japanese very endearing.One Man's Dream,the Magic Lives On is held in a large,covered area.Sometimes there is a lottery for some sessions.My second favourite is Minnie o Minnie,featuring...Minnie!!great costumes and music.The venue is not large and the tiered seating is uncovered but with some shade.I like the Enchanted Tiki Room and haven't had to wait long for this indoor show with an ""in the round"" seating pattern and featuring animatronic singing birds...and Stitch.I did not like the Country Bear show at all.Lyrics in English were quite black.

There are special lunch and dinner shows but advance reservations are needed and on the website this can only be done in Japanese.If you have a Japanese speaking friend this could open up this opportunity.This visit I went to Horseshoe Roundup featuring Woody and a funny Japanese! cowboy.It was a fun show and included lunch.I would like to go to a show featuring Mickey but they sell out early.

My favourite ride is Splash Mountain.Even though we were a group of three,we used the single rider line which significantly shortened our wait.I also like Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a small world.Phantom Manor is excellent but has long queues.Pooh's Hunny Hunt is a top attraction and Fastpasses is good for this.Most people love it but it left me underwhelmed after 2 rides.Not enough visual interest for me.Star Tours has great graphics but is a bit jerky.The jungle cruise develops a long queue early so we headed there first.My lack of Japanese meant the commentary and jokes were completely lost on me but it was scenic.Tom Sawyer's island ( rafts or canoes) could be left for a second visit,after you have seen other things.

I have tried the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall which has awesome theming.I also enjoyed the Blue Bayou,overlooking the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

We stayed three nights in the Disney area at a hotel with a shuttle to the parks.This made getting there an hour before opening possible (it is worthwhile) and made getting back to the hotel when we were exhausted easier than taking the train back to Tokyo and negotiating that looong walk from the Keiyo line at Tokyo station.We had back to back days at Tokyo Disney and Disneysea and it was tiring.We left at 6pm on the second day after our early starts.","Written August 9, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The queues for rides, concessions are shorter
The night parade is better

1620,Loved it!,"Must do: Star Tours, Haunted Mansion, electric dream light show in the evening was something different and worth sticking around for, pizzas for lunch was nice and must have the popcorn (310 yen for regular size) as they are just so moorish. Disney shops were expensive but worth getting a souvenir. Waiting lines were 40-45 mins (we went at end of June so while it was crowded it wasn't stifingly so). You can use a Fast Pass which can reduce waiting time to 0-10 mins, but you can only get a Fast Pass every 1.5 hrs and you are allocated a time that you can enter the ride (usually in 2-3 hrs time). There was so much to explore and we stayed for 10 hrs there - we certainly felt like we saw everything. PS: bring a raincoat if going in June|early July.","Written July 9, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We bought the 2 days tickets online so we didn't need to queue at the ticketing booth. It was great that some of the rides we missed the last visit are open so we had a great time. My younger daughter's a Star Wars fan and she was able to seat the ride 4-5 times to see the 3 possible endings. (hint: To see different endings, join different queue.

1625,Disney Magic and excellent people-watching!,"The lines for the rides are incredibly long, and most of the fast passes are gone if you get to the park anytime after 10 a.m. -- yes, this is all true. The beauty of Tokyo Disneyland is that you don't actually need to ride all of the rides to have a wonderful experience and truly get a taste of that Disney Magic. My friend and I had just as much fun walking around to all of the different snack stands, shopping in the amazing gift shops, and looking at all of the people in the park who had dressed up as their favorite characters for the day.

For those who love the rides, all of your old favorites are here: Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, you name it. The rides are all voiced/dubbed in Japanese (I'm not sure why anyone would go into this expecting otherwise? The park is in Japan.) The parades are gorgeous, and just like at Disneyland and Disney World in the U.S., there are tons of characters walking around and interacting with the crowd. The food is a mix of Japanese and American-themed, and my friend and I both loved the Mickey Mouse-shaped steamed buns! They were really tasty, as was the flavored popcorn you can get at stands throughout the park. The gift shops, as I mentioned, are out of this world -- I was blown away at the sheer amount of apparel, themed snacks, candies, and memorabilia. (I work in the toy industry, so I appreciate when merchandising is done really well, and this is an aspect of Japanese culture I find absolutely fascinating. Everything is so beautifully displayed and packaged!) We didn't make it to any of the shows, but I imagine they were top notch.

Overall, we had a blast, so don't let the lines scare you away. You'll have a wonderful time regardless of how many rides you make it on!","Written June 28, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1626,Disney Magic is always worth a visit,"We stayed for two days and spent from 12pm-9:30pm here both Days! There are rides for everyone from our 2 year old, 5 year old and 15 year old. There are quite a lot more family orientated rides and ""cruises"" which were great we could all go together. The queue for most rides was between 5-15min. Some rides we had totally to ourselves and others we were on before the 5 min. There were bigger rides with longer wait times but we just took a fast pass and came back later. The food was very limited in terms of a western selection. We are pretty picky with food! We ate at the east side cafe the pasta was very nice. I wish the menu was a bit more in depth in English though. There are no ATMS for withdrawal from international cards which I found really odd! Everything is very well organized and lots of fun.","Written June 27, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1627,Wonderful day!!,"Well we spent 11 hours here so no need to say we had a fantastic time. The only negative would be the fast pass. In other parks like Universal Studios that I have visited you can pay extra for the fast pass but here you just go to a machine, was a bit crap really because we used our first pass at 11am and the earliest we could use it was 6.30pm which of course was much later than just waiting in line. If they had paid fast passes I'm sure the line lengths would not be anywhere near as long. We did have an awesome day tho, Splash Mountain was a highlight, very fun ride despite waiting 80 minutes to ride it was worth it. Plenty of food outlets that relate to all tastes. Easy to get around, maybe some more water/drink outlets would be handy. In saying that a lot of the rides had water fountains which was great when waiting in a long line.

1628,A treat for your child - or inner child :),"A day spent in Disneyland is something we all need at least once - whether we do it for our kids or our inner child. After visiting Disneyland Paris a few years ago, it was nice to go to Tokyo and see old and new attractions alike. We went on a Tuesday, but it was still rather crowded (i.e. waiting time for some more popular attractions was close to an hour after lunch). I guess the best part about going - regardless of the rides you take or attractions you visit - is the instant cheer that gets a hold of you a few minutes after entering and only fades out the next day. The fireworks and lights show at the end of the day were brilliant, and so were the parades. As most of the visitors left as soon as they were over, we were able to take maybe 3 rides in about half an hour - one of which started just a few minutes before they closed, and still let us take the ride.
Plenty of places to eat and enjoy dessert, with very helpful and cheerful staff ready to assist at any time. I would definitely recommend a visit there if you go toTokyo.","Written June 20, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Came at 10am and left at around 8pm. My tip is go visit on Weekdays, non holiday. The queue is shorter and faster and not crowded. Have tried their popcorns Curry popcorn is the best for me so far. Will come back here again and will try Disney Sea. We enjoyed The Pirates of Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain and a lot more. Unfortunately, Peter Pan ride is closed until next year.","Written June 19, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1630,There and Back Again!,"Our second trip to TDL in 6 months, summarised below

1) Avoid weekends, regardless of what the crowd calendar says (LOL). We were there on a Sunday, and the crowd was relentless. The lines start at least 1.5 hours before park opening, and almost everything had at least 45 mins standby time. FPs were out by mid-day for all the rides. The lines got a little better towards the evening but by then, we were so tired from standing in line to really care anymore.

We went again on a weekday (3 day passport) and the crowd was much, much better. It looked crowded but the lines were short(er).

2) My son got lost, and it took just minutes for a cast member to send him to Lost Children (next to Monster's Hide & Go Seek). We found him sitting there quietly eating his sandwich while watching Toy Story.

3) Compared to my previous visit, I felt there was more effort by the cast members to speak in English. They also took the time to ask about whether you needed extra gift bags for your purchases (yaay for the environment!)

4) I am still a little upset to not have gotten the tickets for the Once Upon A Time show. The lottery system is very unfair! Yes, we could have viewed it from elsewhere in the park but all the best spots were taken up. A little oddity here is some people stake their spot for the parades and shows really early. The rule is you can't use your mats till an hour before the show, but they don't stop you from taking a spot HOURS before that. So be careful when walking around the park because you may accidently knock into someone sitting (or snoozing) on the ground.

5) Get your hands on the Japanese guide as it lists all the special merchandise and meals available at the park! Really pretty to look at!

6) We missed Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain during our last visit, and we're glad to catch it this time round. They are very good rides, suitable for the whole family! Also worth a visit: Tom Sawyer's Island, which is a large play area with plenty of hiding spots and even water play for the kids.

7) Pinocchio's Daring Journey was closed for refurbishment last year, and I think they've updated it with some additional technology but it went so fast, I barely saw anything.

8) Plenty of toilets and drinking fountains to keep yourselves functioning.

9) Those with kids: use the child switch system to your advantage. Bring the whole family to the cast member at the entrance of the ride, tell them you want to do a child switch. They will issue you a ticket, and one person can go and queue, while the other waits outside with the kids. Afterwards, the second person will get to the front of the line with minimal wait. This comes in handy when you can't fastpass the ride.

Another fastpass hack: there is no distinction between child and adult FPs. So you can make use of child tickets to FP your rides as well :)","Written June 19, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1631,Great and uplifting,"We've been in Disneyland CA and Paris as well, and Disneyland Tokyo is a great member of the Disney franchise.

Very nice and helpful staff, the food was not as awfull as it usually is, and thanks to the discipline of the japanese population, you tend to avoid the same kind of ruthless behaviour from pushy parents (e.g. at greeting points), as we've experienced in the two other Disney parks. Not that Disneyland can be blamed for that :-)

Only thing to consider is the, at times, awful long lines. Some of the most popular rides had more than 60 m. waiting time. And that's off season on an ordinary thursday!

So, be patient, and plan ahead. And consider fast track passes for some of the more popular rides. Oh, and don't forget cash. The only ATM in Disneyland (and Seaworld) was out of cash....","Written June 18, 2015",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1632,Disneyed out!,"Admittedly this is the 9th time we've visited a Disney them Park and fifth different site, but we are questioning the value of spending so much in money and time to only ride 5-6 good rides.

Sure, if this is your first time to Disneyland or your kids are really keen it's worth it, but once you've been a couple of times the junior rides aren't so inviting, and the waits, even utilizing the fast passes, just seem too long.

We purposely chose May for our Japanese visit, as it was not peak season and the weather was warm not hot and very little rain normally. However, Disneyland seemed pretty full, even on a week day.

I can remember a time when we went on every ride in a Disneyland park in one day, and waited no more than 40mins.

You could go in the off peak - maybe winter, but your whole trip planning shouldn't revolve just around Disneyland.

Pirates of the Caribbean was a good ride that you didn't have to wait long for. Space Mountain is another good ride but long waits there - you can on some rides opt for riding single, so you don't queue as long, you just ride with complete strangers to make up the number.

Big Thunder Mountain was another ride with excessive waits that we didn't get to try.
We did wait 90 minutes(or was it two hours!) in the heat to do splash mountain, and I don't think it was worth it.

Monsters Inc ride was also very popular, with a wait time of two hours for most of the day or the fast past meant you'd have to come back in the evening.

It was pretty much the same on the Buzz Lightyear ride - but we used a Fast Pass to see in later on. It's a good family ride with shooting targets...

The Grand Circuit car ride was not so busy and we got a ride here.

Star Tours - similar to California version, but a little better. Very good ride with reasonable wait times.

The Go-Gadget rollercoaster is a mild ride, but the adults will still like it.
The Roger Rabbit ride is similarly suited to younger people, but we all enjoyed it and the wait was fine.

Overall we were left a little annoyed. Maybe we would have been better to go at night??? It's just so busy nearly every day every month. But your tickets before you go to the park, as this will save you time at the park entrance. Come early, as less you have a reason not to. Know in advance the rides you're most likely to want to do, and be familiar with the layout of Disneyland Tokyo. Plan the day ahead, incorporating the Fast Passes.

My 4 years old barely managed to reach the minimum height and she had a blast riding on the Splash Mountain roller coaster 3 times! To maximise your time, study the Disney map carefully and aim to ride on your favourite rides first as the queue can get too much and the rides will stop taking in people. Use the ""Fast Pass"" to get a time slot for your rides and then go do other stuffs before coming back.

We spent 2 days at Disneyland and 1 day and Disneysea and we still could not manage to finish half of the rides because the queues take a long time. With young kids, be prepared to take it slow as they get tired and grouchy after a long day.

My five year old really enjoyed the Buzz Lightyear ride, ""Star Tours,"" the Grand Prix/motorsport ride (which made him feel like he was a real driver) while my one year old loved the very visual rides like ""It's a small world,"" and ""Peter Pan"" and ""Snow White.""

The kids loved the rides and, if I am honest, I think my wife and I had more fun than the boys. We have visited Disney Paris but Disney Tokyo is very different and the lack of Japanese language skills on our part did not detract from what was a great day.

1649,Dream world,"I'm not naturally a big fan of amusement parks, but being a dad forces you to be one.

I first came to Tokyo Disneyland in 1985 while in the USMC stationed in Okinawa then again 5 years ago with my son on our trip through Thailand, Nepal and Japan. He was 10 years old then and had a GREAT time. Now I find myself back again with my 3 year old twin daughters and they had a GREAT time as well. Here's a tip to make your visit a little more comfortable (particularly if you're visiting in the summer as we were): Get a Starlight Passport for entry after 3pm on Saturday and Sunday. It's cooler, less crowded and cheaper. Win-win-win! You can get a Starlight Passport for the weekdays as well, but entry time is after 6pm.

This park is similar to the Disney park in Anaheim, with similar attractions, shows and CROWDS, but Tokyo seemed to be much more organized throughout. And the food was a little different - there were ramen noodles in my hotdog (???)

We really don't indulge in the ride experience because our girls have NO real desire to ride rides (thank God). They just wanted to see Mickey and Minnie, so the long ride lines didn't effect us, but I did notice that they were quite long throughout.

Disney DOES offer re-entry into the park (unlike Universal Studios) which is a great option if you want to leave, get something to eat and return at a cooler or later time. The girls gave us the ""we're done"" signal about 3 hours in and we noticed on our way out (around 7 pm) that numerous people were taking advantage of this.

1650,Must Go and Prepare to Spend more than 1 day here....,"I really enjoyed Tokyo Disney, I've never seen so many people so dedicated to Disney's characters. So much cosplay of Donald, Mickey etc and the amount of adorable Asian children made my ovaries hurt.

I think the castle was the biggest positive for me, this was the first time I could go into it and the Cinderella displays are a delight AND you get to get photos sitting on the royal throne!

It was also pretty great that no matter what show or whatever I was trying to look at, I didn't really have to worry about seeing over other people. I'm about 5'8"" and sometimes struggle at western places, but Tokyo DIsney was orderly about everything from the parades, to the shows, to queuing up for rides.

They don't have the Matterhorn, but I didn't miss it much and the food is definitely superior to Disneyland and Disney World. Everything else was just as good as Disneyland and the general atmosphere was much better - parents at Tokyo Disney just seemed to be able to handle their children better than my previous experiences at American Disney Parks. No gaggles of screaming, disruptive children. No parents yelling at screaming children in a desperate attempt to control them. No sad, tired faces that you generally see on parents at Disneyland at the end of the day. No aggressive place holding for parades or fireworks. Just a lot of people getting along, being supportive of children and the elderly, lots of polite attempts to communicate with us Gaijin.

I would highly recommend, except I can speak a small bit of Japanese - this makes everything a whole lot easier and more entertaining. Many rides are entirely in Japanese, so they're lost on you if you can't understand the language. Rides like the Jungle Cruise, Star Wars The Adventure Continues and many more don't come with subtitles or in English (This is likely obvious to most - you are in TOKYO Disney afterall, but my husband was a bit surprised and disappointed as he doesn't speak a lick of Japanese except 'please' and 'thank you.'

Overall, I would highly recommend, the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's very far away from the city and my husband didn't have nearly as good a time as I did.

Be prepared for crowds and long waits of up to 2 hours on the most popular attractions: there is a fast-track line at many attractions which you should take advantage of if at all possible.

The park remained relatively ""empty"" until around 12pm when there was suddenly a noticeable increase in visitors.

Unlike, the Hong Kong and Paris Disneylands, the Tokyo park really only caters for the Japanese visitor. All commentaries etc are only in Japanese.

I personally felt that this was probably the worst of all the Disneyland parks (Florida, California, Paris, Hong Kong), although it did feature most of the rides you would expect eg Space Mountain, Small World, Jungle Cruise etc etc.

Maybe the fact that we were probably still a little jet-lagged (and hence tired all day) has led to me having a less than positive view of this attraction.","Written April 21, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

wasn't feasible due to the crowd and so the other possible thing to do is to find a suitable eatery to tuck in. Even that was impossible
to do without queuing for hours!
Since it rained in the afternoon for a short while, we decided to shop for some Disney memorabilia in one of the many Disney shops in the park. We did get in but it was congested with so many people trying very hard to get to the items they wanted to purchase. It was utter madness. My daughter with sheer determination in her eyes, managed to successfully grab 5 Frozen stationeries from the shelves. She was happy with that purchase.
The highlight of the day was in the evening when we got to watch
the laser show at Cinderella's castle.Even then, it was difficult to get a good viewing spot as many of seated areas were reserved for the winners of a lucky draw competition. But the show was spectacular! The icing on the cake was the Electric Lights Parade.

I recommend to get the Mickey Mouse shaped waffles with chocolate and ice cream, so delicious! I highly recommend to visit this Disneyland as the attention to detail here is superb from all the novelty shaped food in the restaurants to the amount of merchandise you can get in the shops. It beats the other Disneyland's hands down and I can't wait to go back!","Written April 13, 2015",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Then you can quickly get to the turnstile. Plan your fastpass ticket wisely because you can't hold two at the same time. So before you get on a ride, try to get a fastpass for the next ride you really want to try so you can save time. Food is affordable, and the Disneyland merchandise there is worth buying!

It was a Saturday, and I find it strange that I saw lots of students with uniforms visiting in large numbers. I think that's the rule there to wear uniforms even during weekend school trips. I also saw a bagpiper and he is a young, tall, white guy! We asked for a picture together and he didn't mind, very friendly. Disney characters are very, very popular in Japan, so there is little surprise that it is always crowded in weekends.","Written March 8, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1669,Good time!,"After a tiring business trip in Tokyo, my friend and I decided to unwind in Disneyland just to experience it. Everybody says it will bring out the child in you, and I thought it was overrated. But oh my, everything changed when we got off the bus and saw the Mickey Mouse railway transit! I wished we took the train going there instead of the bus. And there we were standing in front the big Mickey Mouse arch! Going pass that entrance is a totally new world.

It was a hot day in Japan, and we forgot to bring our hats. We immediately saw a souvenir shop and decided to buy items to protect us from the scorching heat. I got Mickey Mouse sunglasses and a hat. We also bought Minnie Mouse ear headbands to complete the fun! Talk about being excited huh! And so we're fully geared for our whole day adventure. :)

Though the queue lines were very long, it didn't matter. There were a lot to see -- the place, the people, and Disney mascots! We went there during Halloween and you can't help but follow and dance along with the parade while having an ice cream or a turkey leg for snacks. We had as much rides as we could, shouted as loud as we could, and walked as much as we could. There were mist sprayers in some areas to refresh visitors. Every setting was a different experience -- even the restaurants. I could go on and on to express my joy and excitement during that day. At night was the most awaited Disney parade, we stretched our legs and sat at the gutters side by side with other visitors. I prepared my camera to capture the the whole parade in video. Then came the dazzling floats, the magical music and awesome fireworks. To my embarrassment, I almost cried, haha! Good thing my friend and her sister didn't notice :P

1670,A child again!,"It was my first visit to Tokyo Disneyland. It was raining the whole day but it still didn't dampen our spirits! However, just a note, families travelling with children, I would suggest you check the weather condition before going as there are some rides/shows which had long queues which might not have sheltered, it wouldn't be nice to get drenched in the rain as the children might fall sick. We skipped some of the rides as it was raining, were afraid to fall sick for the remaining days of our trip. Parades were cancelled due to bad weather as well.
Rides are popular, such as Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, it's normal to queue! On an average, 90 mins each for both rides. Chit-chat with your friends while queuing, or consider getting fast pass! ( We didn't get as we were on budget) The place Is crowded at all times!

We got to do all the things that you do at any Disney site - meet the characters, do the rides, see the great parades and wonderful light show at night.

1672,Interesting Experience,"Our first visit to a Disneyland was Tokyo on a Sunday afternoon/evening on a beautiful winters day. The website had predicted a mildy busy day. The place was packed with people and there was a waiting time over more than 2 hours for most of the rides. There were no ""fast passes"" left so we had to join the standby queues for all rides. There was even a long line to take a photo in front of the ""frozen"" shrine just inside the entrance to the park and there were lengthy queues for food. Some of the rides were closed but we managed to have two rides in our time at the park. We tried to view one of the shows but were informed on arrival at the entrance that you could only enter if you had entered and won a lottery for the ticket earlier in the day (sad face). Our expectations moved from a ride based experience to just soaking up the disney atmosphere and observing the wonderful intersection of American and Japanese culture. This was an excellent experience and worth the visit almost alone. Despite the crowds, the park was immaculate and all of the staff were very friendly, well trained and composed. The light show with the castle backdrop and the light parade were both simply stunning. Most of the announcements and shows are in Japanese but this added to the attraction of the place as it was part of the local charm. Definitely worth a visit but you have to go with the expectation of being part of a large crowd and chill out and enjoy the experience. If rides are your primary motivation, would suggest visiting theme parks in other places such as Kuala Lumpur, Gold Coast or California.","Written January 29, 2015",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1673,Great fun for the family!,"We had a 2 year old in our group so our activities were mainly suited to his needs. The queues were not that bad and we enjoyed 'A Small World' plus the train and car rides. Some of the shows that we thought only had 'Mickey Mouse and friends' actually incorporated some scary ghostly scenes (only in Tokyo Disneyland!) and that was frightening for the toddler. Nevertheless, we had lots of fun... we enjoyed the light parade at the end of the day. I would have preferred a better selection of food around the park so would advice families with toddlers to bring some snacks just in case you can't find anything suitable for your little ones. Loved the shops...would have enjoyed spending a little more time shopping here especially in the sweets/biscuit shop.","Written January 25, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

However, we managed to go on the many other rides and the longest wait was 40 minutes. (We didn't even bother about fast passes). Saw both parades - Main street and Electrical and they were both magnificent. Easy access to the park via train so our day was jam-packed fun.

Other people (visitors) in the park are also more than happy to help if you are stuck or lost. The attractions are so much fun! I spent over 12 hours there on my last visit and wish I could have spent even more time! It is best if you pre-purchase your entry pass, or wait at least and hour to an hour and half after to park opens to buy your entry pass. Amazing shopping to be done as well, it is pricy but worth it! I recommend staying around for the parades and the fire works at night because they are so much fun to watch!

Did about 5 rides and walked a lot. Worked out the fastpass (you can only have 1 active until your time window for the attraction opens, then you can get another). The parade is pretty good (for the kids at least). Pirates of the Caribbean excellent, as was Big Thunder Mountain and Star Tours. Space Mountain was a bit of a challenge for old folk. Watching the Japanese kids in weird clothes was also interesting. So strange. Don't miss the soy sauce and butter popcorn - that's a good one.","Written January 20, 2015",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Arrived at 8AM, the lines were long to get in but it moved pretty quickly. Tip, do not ever do Tomorrowland first but make sure to get FastPasses for the rides that you wanna ride there. If you wanna go on the Winnie the Pooh ride, upon entering, go there directly and get a FastPass. Even the FastPass ticketing line gets long. Of course, do not miss It's A Small World. We went during thw winter holiday so the song was mashed-up with Jingle Bells in different languages. Even the Haunted Mansion was Christmas themed, based on The Nightmare Before Christmas. The Big Thunder Mountain ride line also gets long... so get a Fast pass there too. Don't miss the shows! The One Man's Dream show is pretty spectacular but it's tickets you get from a lottery. So if you wanna make sure you get to watch, do the very first show but make sure you come way ahead of start time. We went there 30mins before and it was already full. If you want to watch the other times, you can go to the lottery area and get a ticket. You can also get a ticket for the Once Upon a Time show there for the best view seats.

One interesting thing to try that is very popular are the various types of popcorn available throughout the park. From Soy Sauce and Butter to Curry flavored (I don't recommend the latter) there are about 8 different flavors at various stands around the park with different collector's buckets.

1685,A good day out for the family,"Just did a day trip to the much hyped Tokyo Disneyland. Left the Tokyo Dome hotel at 8.30am and was at the entrance by 9am using the highway. The crowd is 99% Japanese and thus all announcements except the daily specials (fireworks, lights, parades) had some English. The Japanese are such disciplined and patient people. They come with their mats and rugs and would sit on the road/floor for various parades 2-3 hours ahead. The usual street parades are copies of parades from other Disneys. The lines for the popular rides were long, often over 70 minutes so knowing how to take advantage of the fast pass is essential to maximise number of rides. The Japanese staff/attendants' English must be improved, as the attendant's 70 minutes was heard as 17 minutes and hence a long wait for a Big Splash ride! All attractions were exact replicas except for the language.

What is most disappointing was the fireworks at the end of the day starting at 8.30pm sharp and finishing at 8,33pm! Oh yes, I waited the whole day in freezing temperature to the biggest anti climax and disappointment of the fireworks! Please don't bother waiting and waste precious time in the cold and spending another 7000 Yens for taxi ride back to hotel.","Written December 23, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1686,So over rated Disneyland fireworks!,"I have to be honest, I was skeptical about wasting a precious day in Tokyo at a theme park - but I was totally wrong, Disneyland was awesome.

Maybe it's just tapping into my childhood memories of watching Disney films etc, but there genuinely is something magical about the place.

As others note, it is extraordinarily crowded, I went on a weekday and seeing a queue for a ride under an hour or so was rare - 2 and a half hour waits were not uncommon. Fortunately I really wasn't attending for the rides. Honestly I didn't find the prices that outragous, yes it's not cheap but it's not astronomical.

My lasting memory will include how friendly, professional and accomodating the staff I dealt with were. My partner was concerned she would not fit on many of the rides, and didn't want to wait for an hour to answer that question. On numerous occasions she approached ride staff to ask, who despite not being all that good with English understood her, treated her with respect and actually took her to the front of the line to see if she'd fit in the rides safely before returning back to the line at an appropriate point if she did, or back to the exit if she did not. I was very impressed.

Only complaint? There really weren't many toilets around the park! I had to go looking for them often - and when found there were lines for the mens room.","Written December 18, 2014",3.0 of 5 bubbles

1688,Its Disney and its awesome,"This is our third trip from Australia to Urayasu and the Disney parks. Having previously experienced the summer fun and spectacular shows, as well as Halloween, we were looking forward to experiencing Christmas @ Disney, and again Disney doe's it in style and with total style and was not at all disapppointed.
While the rides are not a major drawcard for us, the lines were exceptionally long, and if you are planning a one day visit only, then you will not get everything done. A three day passport might help to get on the rides! The park is always crowded, and sometimes appears overcrowded with too many in the one place at the same time. there seems to be little crowd control, except for preparation of the parades, where staff are very diligent in making sure there is no happiness about taking up a spot for a parade. They seem to do their best to ensure you don't move from the spot you have claimed, you cannot stand on benches, prams and strollers must be folded up, do not put your feet over the edge of the pathway, and you could be waiting for up to an hour before the parade gets near you as it makes it way around the long course.
Some guests clearly were over the constant walking up and down of staff that seemed to upset them constantly, and this in Disneyland, which in Tokyo doe's not translate to the 'happiest place on earth' as Mr Disney had planned.
The control and need for the staff actions however is necessary with the huge crowds needed to be kept at a comfortable pace from the roadway and to give everyone a good view. It doe's however seem it could be handled better.
Japanese fans of Disney are super fans, you never see anything like it anywhere else! They dress up, have bags of mini plush characters on them, some with dozens attached to their back packs, men wearing Mickey hats, and total mayhem when a Disney character makes an appearance, in fact, the only one we saw all day was a fairy godmother of something, not even a well known Disney character and there was quite a line up for 'one only' photo allowed!
Pre purchase of admission tickets is the best idea as it allows straight through the booths, while the line up at the ticket booths is quite huge.
Christmas Overload? Totally, if Christmas is not your style, you don't overly enjoy the festive season or, it's just too much, then Tokyo Disneyland will provide you with every reason to dislike Christmas!
Everywhere, from the massive Christmas Tree in World Bazaar, to the daily Disney 'Santa Village Parade' and 'Happiness Is Here' parade, the constant Christmas music everywhere, and the shops then take on that Christmas atmosphere, not much you buy as normal Disney merchandise, it's all Christmas related from Christmas Wishes 2014 postcards, magnets, stand up tree, stickers, plush toys in Christmas outfits etc etc just such a huge range to choose from.
Following the parades the stores are overcrowded and there's no room to move and to even get to a cashier you cannot even find where the queue is!
Bon Voyage outside the park is less frenzied with all the same merchandise that is sold in the park.
The quickest ride we went on was 'It's A Small World', a boat ride through the lands of the world, a quick ride, but at least something you can do and enjoy without waiting for more than 20 minutes!
Tokyo Disneyland Electrical parade 'Dreamlights', at 7.30pm is spectacular and dressed up for Christmas, but is much the same as we have seen before.
Food choices are very poor, unless you dine in the Crystal Palace restaurant, but even there the menu did not appeal. We stuck to hot dogs and fries, and Mickey pizzas. Flavoured popcorn was available all over the park, chocolate, caramel and cheese!!
Cinderellas Castle is not decorated, that is because of 'Once Upon A Time' dazzling light show @ 5.30pm, an intriguing light show of characters and a story on the facade of the castle.
Most shows are in Japanese, some provide english translation but that seems pointless, but this is Japan, and for what the park doe's, is good for foreign visitors.
Just the overcrowding, long ride line ups, and crowd crushes in stores, can sometimes make this a place to avoid rather enjoy! Let the magic continue Disney, now on to Disney Sea!!","Written December 14, 2014",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We brought our infant son and found the 2 baby centers to be fantastic for feeding, changing, etc. Note that this park gets crazy busy on most weekends and during Japanese school holidays in August and March. It is critical to check the Tokyo Disneyland Crowd Calculator (online) to determine when these days are.... and avoid them. No one wants to stand in a 4-hour line if they don't have to. My husband and I liked the food options, but many are not necessarily for a Western pallet, so if you have picky kids pack snacks.

1697,The happiest LINES in the world,"First ever visit to a Disney theme park, so it was a real learning experience for me. After arriving at 9am to try and avoid as many queues as possible, it does not take long for the lines to form - hence came my first learning - FastPass!

Disney has a system called fast pass, where for selected rides, you can go to the ride, scan your entry ticket on the FastPass machine and it will issue you a ticket for that ride, to come back at a designated time period. When you do come back, you then pretty much jump to the front of the queue. Note that you can only have one FastPass at a time, so I would highly recommend, choosing a ride to 'FastPass', get your ticket, then go see some of the less popular attractions / eat /etc, go back at your time, then straight after go and get your next FastPass. Note that because they give you a set time, FastPass tickets tend to book out by mid afternoon - then you have no choice but to queue.

Do not miss the daytime parade... despite an overly happy song being on loop for 20 minutes, you can't help but smile as you see all the floats and characters.

Wear comfortable shoes - you will have lots of walking and standing in queues!

If you do not speak Japanese - sadly most of the rides (with the exception of the Pirates of the Caribbean) are in Japanese - but don't worry they are still fun

If you go on Splash Mountain - avoid the front seat of the cars... you will get drenched!

If you are looking for super fast, scary rides - Disneyland is not one of those theme parks - everything is generally family friendly and the adrenalin level is not super high. DisneySea has more rides for an adrenalin rush.","Written November 11, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles

The queues were very long for some rides and very unpleasant shuffling along in the heat. The fast pass system is different and fairer but you only get to use about 2 before they stop. The variety of food outlets is good but the choice at each one is minimal. It made it difficult to find somewhere the whole family could find food they liked. We were fascinated with the different popcorn options, including curry, strawberry, soy sauce. Our favorite rides included space mountain and splash mountain. We would have loved to go on them twice but could not cope with more 90 minute queues. The electric parade was fantastic but you had to find a place to sit one hour before it to be able enjoy it. We were very disappointed that the fireworks were cancelled due to ""inclement weather"" but there was no rain.

1705,very well kept,"For a theme park that celebrated their 30th anniversary last yr it is very well kept. My 5 yr old had great fun but unfortunately there was not much on offer for my 2 yr old. The food was much better than anticipated both in terms of taste and price which was decent and reasonable (after having experienced Hong Kong Disneyland‚Ä¶)
We went there by bus from Shinjuku station New South Exit bus terminal. There was no doubt about which bus to catch but buying the ticket was not as easy as expected since staff didn't speak English and did not seem to want to help even though they were free. On our return we caught the train which was much easier, just follow everyone else!
The electrical parade is a must and is a wonderful wonderful way to end the visit!","Written September 3, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1706,Crowded but fun,"I've only ever been to this park and Disneyland Paris so those are the only two I can compare. To both parks I've only ever gone during the week. In Paris you can find some rather deserted days where you can easily do all the attractions more than once but I knew in advance that the Tokyo park would be crowded as anything (you just have to know how crazy Japanese people are about any Disney feature or character). So I didn't expect to have time to do all the 8 attractions I wanted, but I did! And I even got to go on Big Thunder Mountain 3 times, and Space Mountain twice. Both are longer and faster than in Paris. In fact I would say all the rides go a little faster than the ones in Paris, have bigger drops etc. So people who don't like that very much should be warned.
I wouldn't recommend going on a weekend, as even Japanese people who do that acknowledge they don't go on any rides but go there just for the atmosphere and the shopping and restaurants... this isn't my idea of fun even if it is true that people are all polite and smiling.
I also recommend to go early as the school students start streaming into the park from 3pm and from then on you have to do much longer queues to get into any attraction.
The food was not interesting (as any of the park food I've eaten) but some had really cute shapes.
Sadly I've heard that in the world those 2 parks are very similar in terms of attractions, and that was true. There was only 1 extra attraction in Tokyo: Splash Mountain, which I absolutely loved, was surprisingly long (9min, it was really nice) and I highly recommend. There was only 1 attraction that was very different: Space mountain which I like better in Paris because of the retro Jules Verne style rather than the hallucinated ride in Tokyo.","Written September 1, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1707,1st ever visit to Disneyland,"Before going I was aware that Tokyo Disneyland is widely considered to be the best of the Disney parks. I have visited Disneyland California, Disneyland Paris and now Disneyland Tokyo and I absolutely agree that this is the best of the three. It was busy there, but not crazy busy. More importantly, busy does not mean the same thing in Japan as it does in the US. Busy in the US means bring some body armor because you're going to catch a few elbows and have to constantly dodge hundreds of children running in circles screaming. In Japan there could be a million people there and you still wouldn't make contact with anyone, such is their culture, and it's a beautiful thing.

The second great thing about Tokyo Disneyland is that it feels much more compact than the other Disney parks. I don't know whether it actually IS smaller in terms of square acres, but everything feels much closer..you can walk from one side of the park to the other in no more than 10 minutes, less if you're in a hurry. This makes going back and forth between space mountain and thunder mountain all day a much less draining experience than in other parks.

One negative aspect to Tokyo Disneyland versus the other two, is that the fast passes tend to run out fairly early in the day...when we visited the fast passes were finished for the day by around 1pm. Maybe this happens at the other parks, too, and I just got lucky to avoid it on my visits, but I hadn't experienced this in the past. Once the fast passes run out I lose my motivation to stay; I'm not prepared to wait 2 hours in line for anything, especially when it's 36 degrees and 90% humidity, so that was a bit unfortunate.

Other than that however we had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland and like I've said, it's definitely the best I've experienced.","Written September 1, 2014",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1708,The best Disneyland park,The Disneyland in Tokyo is a must visit for tourists with family as the kids would love this place. The activities start with the train ride to the park. The queues are quite long for the tickets. The same is the experience with the rides. On one occation I ended up in a show after 25mins of waiting and it turned out to be in Japanese. The park is excellent for kids coz the games and themes and settings are tailor made for them. Could not cover all the rides. The parade was good and if u want to take a closer look of it one would have to take a early seat in the grass. The people were very organised and was amazed to see how the people were polite and waited for the turn in the large queues with no one cutting in or breaking the line.

Disney For the Roller Coaster Lover or as they say in Japan - Jet Coaster

The Best way to do Disney is via fast pass usually you can only get them every 30min so its best to get one for one of the major coasters while you wait in line for another coaster that way we were able to hit all the major coasters they had and even a few smaller rides the smaller attractions are best to get right after the parade most people will be watching so if you duck out a little early you can save yourself a long wait on quite a few rides or if you don't care about the parade its best to hit as many rides as you can now

Food:

soo much good food I recommend

1. Roast Turkey Leg ..as you may nor may not know turkey is hard to get in Japan ..and this is smokey and delicious located in the western town sold by cart

2. Toy Story mochi - get cute alien designed mochi dessert

3. Belgium Waffles in the shape of mickey or minnie mouse located near the entrance you can see the cooks working away to make these delicious treats

1711,As Florida but longer queues,"(This review is for just Tokyo Disneyland, not Disney Sea)
We visited in early March. It was busy near the entrance, but once we got into the park the crowds were small, queues moved along quickly, and we even had some areas to ourselves. A good time to visit to avoid the crowds in Spring or Summer holidays.
We spent almost 12 hours in the park, and did not see or do everything. There really is so much to see and do in the park! Thanks to the scenery and music, in the park is like being in another world, transported from Japan. Apparently it is deliberately designed so you cannot see the outside world, and it works. There are a lot of fine details that add to the illusion of being in another world, particularly in the queuing areas while you wait to enter an attraction, so you're never bored.
Staff are very friendly, everything was clean and tidy. The only negative may be the lack of a cafe where we could just sit and have a drink, though there are plenty of restaurants, fast food, and food/drink stalls around the park. Prices are a little high, but reasonable considering the high quality.

That being said the service is (almost) without exception, efficient and polite. Most attractions are in Japanese therefore shows may not make much sense if you're seeking to understand what is being said/sung. The internal rail fees are extortionate in comparison to the local transit system - which in Japan is extremely efficient and clean.

Tokyo Disneyland is just the right size, for bringing back those memories of my first visit to Disney in the 70s. The characters roamed freely and were readily accessible for photos. The cast members were courteous, friendly, and helpful. There was lots to see and do around every corner. My favorite attractions include ""It's a Small World,"" ""Big Thunder Mountain,"" ""Pooh's Honey Pot"" and the ""Electric Lights Parade!""

1722,As you'd expect from Disney.,"Spent 3 days doing Tokyo Disney as part of a two week trip in Japan. Having visited Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong, this certainly hits the Disney standard. Space Mountain being closed through June was a small disappointment, but not to spoil the whole experience. The attractions are all of a high standard, but some attractions may be better suited to Disney Sea and vice versa, but that's just a personal opinion. Food-wise, you will find something to suit all tastes (you won't starve) but the Hungry Bear restaurant is highly recommended for curry and rice. If you're a popcorn fan, buy one of the popcorn buckets that you can put round your neck, as the (more generous) refills for it present better value for money than the sole popcorn bag.

To avoid potentially long queues, use the fastpass where possible but be mindful of the return times (an example being Toy Story, where a fastpass issued at 1100 gave a return time 2030-2130!) as they may impact on your day if you're planning on attending shows in the park. If you are lucky to win in the ticket lottery (as we were) for the shows, the ""Once Upon A Time"" show is highly recommended.

If you're visiting the parks for multiple days, buy a magic passport as it saves money in the long run. Overall, it was a good experience.","Written June 25, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1723,Fun park but crowded,"We tried to buy the tickets online before our trip but the online system requires too many private information before we can even set up to purchase the tickets. Eventually, found H.I.S travel in Singapore (located at 100AM mall) and bought the tickets for both Disneyland and DisneySea before our trip. Service at HIS travel was good and friendly and they even sell the tickets to Sanrio Puroland (which we got at a discount compared to buying at Puroland directly).

To get to DisneySea, you need to take the JR line (Chuo or Yamanote line) to Tokyo station and then at Tokyo station, one need to change to JR Keio / Mushashino line heading to Maihama station. The transfer time takes about 15 mins, so do factor it in for the travel time. Upon arriving at Maihama station, you can proceed towards DisneySea (to take the Disney rail) that will stop at Disneyland. We were not aware of this and ended up walking to Disneyland, which can be quite a long walk for young children and seniors. It makes more sense to pay for the short rail right that takes one right to the park and conserve the energy for the time in the park.
Having been to Disneyland HK, Disneyland Tokyo is definitely bigger and much more crowded than HK. We were there on Monday and yet the crowd was crazy. We skipped those rides that were similar to the ones at HK and tried the ones that were not available in HK Disneyland.
Also, being someone who doesn't really enjoy waiting in queues in theme parks, we usually skipped the attractions that has a waiting time more than 40mins. We will go to the ones that has a shorter waiting time and then come back again to the ones that we missed earlier if the waiting time has been shortened.

There are many rides In Disneyland and it's impossible to do all of them in one day. Getting the fast pass helps (though they ran out early), so the next strategy is to target those with shorter waiting time first. Don't worry, what you miss earlier, you may end up getting to the ride later in the day, with a shorter waiting time... (Provided you don't mind walking more in the park).

Between Disneyland and DisneySea, my young children enjoyed DisneySea more. DisneySea seems more calm and a little less crowded (crazy) than Disneyland. There were some rides that they could even go for more than once.","Written June 17, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles

From the magical parades both day and night, to the shows and rides. The trip made you feel like a kid once again. I would recommend that you plan your day early, to get the fast pass to all the rides you wanted! Everytime of the year, this place will be swarmed with locals and tourists alike! So planning and time management is the key to get through all the rides and shows. If you have time, at least spend a day at Disneyland so you can catch the afternoon parade and night parade! They are the highlights!

If this is the first time going to Disneyland, I would recommend a day in Disneyland and a day in Disney Sea. Due to the language barrier (if you don't know Japanese language) there are some shows that you might need to skip as you wont understand as they converse in Japanese like one of Aladdin magic shows. As this is my first Disneyland adventure, I would definitely would have preferred to go to the US Disneyland first, so you'll know the base of the shows.

I went with a 2 year old toddler. Because of this we didn't get a chance to explore the whole park BUT the rides that we did go on with her - she absolutely loved! There weren't many other thrilling rides for adults.

There were plenty of places selling Disney merchandise so you can deck yourself and your kid in Disney hats, giant glasses etc. I would recommend to not get overly excited like I did when entering the very first Disney store. There are more interesting and unique products you can buy throughout the rest of Disneyland.

There are prams available for hire if you didn't want to bring your own. Plenty of baby change areas but due to the crowds and mothers lining up - I ended up just changing my baby on a bench somewhere.

Definitely watch every single parade that is available throughout the day - I think there's 3 all up - in case the later ones are cancelled due to bad weather. Unfortunately we missed the night electric show for this reason.","Written May 26, 2014",5.0 of 5 bubbles

On consulting the map we were disappointed to see how few rides there were compared to the endless listings of shopping and food outlets. And the sheer volume of people made getting on those rides a mega task especially as Fast Track finishes at 6pm. The Electric parade was fun - It's a Small World was just as good as we remembered it - but generally it felt like technology has moved on but Disney hasn't. The thrill factor of somthing like Space Mountain or the Haunted House has gone - it all seems so dated and those endless lines don't help.

We also wanted to go to ""Monster's Inc - Hide and Seek"", so took ""Fast Pass"" which is like a reserved ticket, so if you come back to the specified time on the ticket, you can ride the attraction without any wait. At the time of 9:30am, the ""Fast Pass"" time was 7-8 pm, so you need to get ""Fast Pass"" as soon as you enter the park.
We also went to ""Meet Mickey"" where you can meet and take a photo with Mickey Mouse. The queue seemed short, so we decided to wait, but the house where Mickey waiting was just like a maize, and it took so long to actually meet Mickey.

It took very little time to get through the gates, was told to expect maybe to wait an hour but ended up being 20 minutes tops. I had waited 28 years so another hour wasn't going to worry me!

The place was amazingly decorated with Easter decorations, in loads of pastels and cute little egg shaped characters around the park.
The park was busy but not as crazy busy as I thought it would be, so could move around freely and enjoy the attractions. I am not a ride person at all so I just liked walking around the shops and seeing the people dressed up.. Donald.. Mickey.. Minnie etc. The lines for the rides were insane, but if you enjoy that sort of thing you might want to make your day longer there or do it over a couple of days.
They had things that you wouldn't find at other Disney parks.. such as Soy Sauce or Curry popcorn, and my favourite... Carrot and Orange churros!!
Shoppers paradise: could have blown all my money there haha but lots of cute gifts to take back home and a lot of things were really reasonably priced. My Minnie ears about $13NZD!! Cheap! If you don't wear something like that you feel out of place :P
The staff were spot on and polite and made sure that everyone was sitting correctly for the parades, unfortunately the wind picked up quite badly so they had to cancel the parades for the day!
Food was good, had a mickey shaped waffle for breakfast there and a coffee - easy peasy to order in English as well. I had a pork cutlet curry for lunch, glad I ordered the small as the large would have been way way too much. Make sure you get an apple soda from one of the vendors as it's so refreshing and the day was pretty hot. I was told the drinks were really expensive there but I didn't find that.
I loved my day there and would love to go back again. A well oiled machine. My highlights were the New Orleans street recreation and meeting Mickey in his house with a professional photo at a really reasonable price too. Nice momento of the day!","Written April 19, 2014",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1741,Not as magical as I had hoped,"My girlfriend & I arrived at Disneyland around 10:30am, with the sun shining and a glorious day of rides planned ahead.

When we got through the gates, it became quickly apparent that the rides element of our day was unlikely to come to full fruition.

There was a minimum wait of 120 minutes for everything, some rides exceed 200 minutes. We couldn't quite believe it. We were only able to get one fast pass ticket as all of the fast pass tickets had run out by the time we tried to get our second.

It was a real shame. We assumed it to be because of the school holidays, although I couldn't quite understand why they'd allow so many people into the park if there wasn't the capacity for all patrons to access all the rides. I don't mind queuing to an extent, but 3 hours for a 5 minute ride seemed a little excessive to me.","Written April 19, 2014",2.0 of 5 bubbles

1744,Tokyo Disneyland - the Domestic Market Rules,"We spent four days at Disneyland and Disney Sea last week. It was a school holiday (Sakura) in Japan, and the place was crowded.

We arrived at 7:30 to get into Disneyland and we were among about 3,000 other people. Although the gates opened at 8:00, we got in at 8:30. We headed for the Winnie the Pooh ride to get Fast Passes, but the lineup for those were over an hour. Instead we went on It's a Small World and then to the Haunted House.

Disneyland serves the domestic Japanese market and they LOVE it. The park was packed with waits being between 30 minutes for things like the carousel and about 3 hours for Winnie the Pooh at peak. In the stores, clothing is widely available, but there is nothing branded Tokyo Disneyland Resort, such as you would find at any of the other Disneys. However, there are a lot of other funky t-shirts and accessories that are unique - just not branded.

Overall, I would go again - but am glad it wasn't my first Disney to get to (we have been to every Disneyland in the world).","Written April 10, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1745,Crowded but fun,"If you go to Tokyo Disneyland in the summer you can expect it to be crowded and hot, with long lines everywhere. This isn't to say you can't have fun though!

Going early, i.e. when the park opens, is the best way to get on your favourite rides, and taking advantage of the FastPass system is almost a necessity to avoid waiting in long queue's in the hot sun - few rides have sheltered lines.

It is still essentially Disney and aimed more at younger (& smaller) kids. Worth a full day, don't try doing DisneySea in the one day - if you can only do one, DisneySea is better!","Written April 7, 2014",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1746,Grossly overcrowded,"We went as a family mid week, and the queues for almost everything were ridiculous. We arrived in the morning, having stayed right next door at the Hilton Tokyo Bay (which was great - see my separate review).

We got into ""It's A Small World"" relatively quickly (by which I mean less than 30 minutes).

Apart from that... the only thing we managed to see was Snow White, which we queued about 90 minutes for. The ride lasted about 4 minutes... And had a warning sign, towards the front of the queue, about ""a witch"", but was actually almost completely full of ""scary"" things. My two daughters both ended up crying at the end and didn't enjoy the experience.

We did a lot of walking, looking around for something we could actually enjoy together and not have to wait hours for... Occasionally some of the architecture (if it warrants being called that) was impressive in some sense. But there were no other rides where we felt there was any point waiting though, as the queues were ridiculous - even the simple merry-go-round had a queue indicating a 90 minute wait. This was nothing any of us were prepared to do, particularly when it was obvious the ride was really nothing special.

We were able to get lunch without much queuing, but only by eating very early.

We ended up leaving at about 2 pm even though we could have theoretically stayed many more hours.

I had some mild enjoyment from seeing other people apparently having fun - even though my family and kids weren't.

I have chosen ""more than 3 hours"" for recommended visit length mostly because any less and you may not get to go on any rides at all. For us though 3 hours was more than enough and we were happy to leave and get on with the rest of our holiday.","Written April 2, 2014",2.0 of 5 bubbles

1751,Would be fun if the crowds were smaller,"It is Disneyland and has most of the main attractions you'd expect (though smaller than the LA one). So from that point of view, if you've never been to Disneyland and are keen to go, it is worth it just for the experience.

However, the lines are enormous!! When we got there at 9am, lines for the most popular rides were already over 200 minutes!!! When we tried to use our fast passes at about 9:30am, the earliest available time for some of those rides was about 7-8pm at night. Even getting popcorn meant standing in line for 20 minutes or so.

I think in LA Disneyland there were Disney characters walking all around that you could get photos with, etc (I went as a kid many years ago). In Tokyo, you have to line up for about 10mins or so in one of only a couple of spots where Mickey and others make brief appearances - fine for us as adults, but pretty slack for little kids. Even the gift shops were incredibly crowded.

There is a parade (I think around 2pm or so) which is worth seeing.

In short: If you've never been to another Disneyland and are keen, you may as well. Otherwise, don't go and expect to do more than 1-2 rides and much else the entire day, other than push through crowds.","Written January 15, 2014",3.0 of 5 bubbles

1753,"A great Disney experience, but way too crowded","Disneyland Tokyo is a must for Disney lovers, but not a must for first time visitors to Japan. Give it a chance if you have one day to spare. Disneyland Tokyo is a really beautiful place, with a lot of attractions, but so crowded by Japanese that it is really stressful. FastPasses run out extremely quickly, and some attractions have an average queue of 2 hours, a big con. Do not expect to go to the SpaceMountain without waiting +1 hour. So you will spend the whole day and probably miss some attractions. We were there on Halloween, so it was a great experience because of the additional ornaments. Japanese are always very attentive, so that was a plus too. Pop corn is sold in several alternatives (salty, curry, caramel, soy, etc.) so try them. Another big plus is the quality of the fast food, really above any fast food I have tried in any theme park.

During the summer, they have an awesome promotion for ""natsu after 5 passports"" where you can enjoy the park from 5pm until closing, at a relatively inexpensive price, I've done this several times, and it can especially be worth it on a weekday when it isn't so busy.

To get your moneys worth out of the entry price is impossible. Having been to California Disneyland and Disney World in Florida where at this time of year you can get on most rides with a 15 -30 minute wait I didn't expect Tokyo to be so much more crowded.
I think for us the final straw was lining up to use the rest room and around 5pm we headed back to out hotel very tired and let down after only 3 rides.

1763,Avoid under any circumstances,"We have now been to Disneylands in Paris, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and now Tokyo as well as Epcot Center Miami. We have visited at least a dozen of other theme parks around the globe. This must have been the most crowded one BY FAR. We came on a Monday on the last day of September, I'm not familiar with school holidays in Japan, but I imagine, it was a school day. We thought we were smart having bought the tickets in advance and having avoided the first queue of at least an hour, I think if we hadn't, we might have opted for DisneySea next door. The first ride we came across was the Monsters Inc. one with a waiting time of 200 (!) minutes. As a Star Wars fan, I wanted to do the Star Tours ride, but that had a waiting time of 120 minutes, so we got Fast Pass tickets for that ride which was due 2 hours later at 12:30. We passed the time until then with mediocre rides, and wanted to get new Fast Pass tickets for the Monsters Inc ride, but behold: FP ticketing for that ride (and for the Buzz Lightyear one, and Space Mountain) had already ended! Mind you, the park was opened for another 9 3/4 hours! By the time we made it to the other side of the park, there were no FP tickets available for any rides.
All the attractive rides had a line of at least 90 minutes, and that did not change until the park was closed. Even the boring ones, like the Dumbo or the Merry-go-round, you know those, which you can find at your local fair for 2.50 EUR, had people queuing up for an hour.
They had a nice parade going on, at least from what we could make out, as we had been ushered away every time we had a good view. We haven't managed to find out the reason as English speaking personell was hard to come by.
Considering that admission for adults is 6200 Yen (about 46.50 EUR) and discounts are hardly available, spending 10 hours waiting in line for 3 good rides and maybe 4 mediocre ones is a costly way to spend your time.
If you are in Tokyo and you have to visit one of the Disney theme parks, I suggest you try DisneySea. However I strongly recommend going to Disneyland on another continent (most stuff is in Japanese anyway).

1764,Like Disneyland Hong Kong but wait times much longer,"We have two young sons and spent the morning at Disney Seas. Since it closed early we had the option to head to Disneyland for an extra 2,000 each so we took advantage of it. We left Disney Seas with the very short wait times and spent the evening at Disneyland waiting over one hour for the Dumbo ride. Other rides where worse with over 130 minute wait times and no fast pass available. The set up is pretty much like Disneyland Hong Kong. The food is just OK with nothing to eat from the street vendors but different flavored popcorns or the same freezy bars at each place. Ad of course, the are more stores and restaurants than entertainment options. After experiencing one Disneyland, I wasn't impressed. My 5 year old did like Toontown, there is only one ride in there and it is a coaster which he liked. Funny how that coaster is in with little kid stuff and the only people on it were adults. My son loved going through Donald's boat even though there wasn't a whole lot of interactive things.

If you don't have time for both, I would do Disney Seas as a nice change from the typical Disneyland experience. Disney Seas does seem to be geared towards the older kids but my 5 and 8 year old loved it (but they ready boys, not into princesses).","Written September 30, 2013",3.0 of 5 bubbles
1765,Familiar and fun,"We had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland, although it's much more crowded than California Disneyland mid-week in mid-September. (Think mid-July in California, that's an average day at Tokyo Disneyland). My husband prefers Tokyo Disneyland to California Disneyland; I prefer California. I do like the layout of Tokyo Disneyland better--it feels more open and easier to get around in. Perhaps because there's no Matterhorn and no Indiana Jones so there is literally more space. Also Japanese people are more orderly and polite than anyone else in the world, so that could have something to do with it.

The rides are pretty much the same as Disneyland in California, but Space Mountain felt a little slower and had no music. :( It was still fun, but music really makes a big difference. Splash Mountain was also a little different...You sit in pairs in the log rather than a single line (so there's less leg room) and you don't get nearly as wet...You will get splashed in your face if you're in the front, but that's the wettest you'll get. Single rider line is more enjoyable in California because you're not sitting next to anyone...I recommend fast pass or early standby on this instead of single rider so you can sit with your party. The standby line is 2-3 hours on a typical day mid-week in mid-September (not a holiday) after 12 pm...If you go on this ride first thing in the morning, standby is 40-60 min. All of the other rides here are pretty much the same as California Disneyland.

As with DisneySea, overall, the food was NOT impressive. Bring food from outside if you can. The Queen of Hearts Restaurant was not bad though. The detail of the restaurant is awesome and the food was pretty good--similar prices to a buffeteria at Disneyland in California, maybe a little pricier considering the smaller portion sizes though.

Tips: Get there early--no later than an hour after opening so you can get as many fastpasses as possible. The first day, we got in around 15 min after opening and the second day we got in around 45 min after opening...both days we got two fastpasses. Decide the three rides you want to do the most and have one member of the party run for fastpasses while the rest of your party goes to the other ride and gets in line. As soon as your first fastpass window opens up, go get fastpasses for the third ride you want to go on, and so on. Wouldn't recommend an after 6 pm ticket here unless you're just coming for the parade or a show or something.","Written September 21, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

This is particularly high praise given I'm not really into A) Disney or B) theme parks. Disneyland to theme to the max, even your chicken nuggets in the fast food cafes are shaped like Mickey Mouse!

As far as the rides go, please just get there early - especially on a weekend. Make sure you use the fast pass system, which effectively means you don't have to queue, but you can only 'fast pass' one ride at a time. As for the rest of the rides, get comfortable with queueing, the average waiting time at a weekend being around 2 hours or more for the more popular rides.

On the whole, Disneyland Tokyo is great, if you are in two minds whether you should give it a go, just do it, its tiring but you really won't be disappointed, especially if you have kids (or a wife who still thinks she is 12!).

Pros were the lines, even though longer than the states, went faster, clean, and like I've said before had different things to shop for than the ones in the US. Cons were most animated rides were in Japanese so you couldn't really understand what they were saying. food sold is all ala carte so if you buy a burger, fries and soda it could cost you close to $15. If you have a big family I suggest a snack during the day and the buffet for dinner. Also don't expect to get a lot of treats that the US offers. Mostly they had tons of different types of popcorn, waffles, Popsicles, and crepes. Except for the food souvenir store that had gift boxes of cookies. There's no refillable cups. So the day we went just happened to have a heat wave so I spent majority of our money buying bottles of water ($2) all day. Then only frontier town sold plain water so we had to walk back there every time we wanted water. All other vendors sold oolong tea and orange flavored water. One thing I did learn was that those refillable popcorn cases that you get at Disneyland works at all parks. So if you have one from the states you can use it here. The rides seem shorter too.
All in all it was interesting. Glad I went just to have that experience. Everyone was very nice and helpful especially when you don't know the language. I think though it was a one time thing for me.","Written September 4, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Secondly, the food was much better than people suggested. Thirdly, if you use the fastpass properly, you can get a few rides done very quickly. Yes, you will need to standby on a couple, but what are people expecting, its a major theme park. The rides were brilliant and worth the wait. Add the excellent parade, and we had a great time, and my 9 year old son reckoned it was one of his best days.

1778,Always a fan of Disneyland,"A lot of reviews much have mentioned that the wait is ridiculous for each ride here.

Well, we went on a Monday and a non-school holiday so although it was crowded, it wasn't that long a wait say 50-60 mins, as shared, per ride. Not sure if we were lucky. We did go against the usual flow of starting the park with Adventureland instead of Tomorrowland.

But the wait was mostly between 10-30 mins per ride at most. Tho I must admit the longest one was worth the wait indeed 70 mins - a photo with Mickey Mouse at his home in Toontown and Monster Inc. Otherwise, we have actually managed rides which took us less than 7 mins wait.

We certainly enjoyed ourselves there and stayed til 10 pm it's closing time. But yeah we intentionally missed some rides especially in Toontown cos it's a little too kiddy for our children. The achievement was to cover at least 80-90 % of Tokyo Disneyland reputed for it's crowd.

And overall, it's a great experience still.

Tips : If you miss the first round, you can meet Mickey and Minnie at the entrance at 11.55 am near the park's entrance. Also, do not delay getting out of Disneyland after closing time as the last train leaves Maihama not long after.

1779,For the young and young at heart,"We had a great day at Tokyo Disneyland. You can't not have a good day here. There is just something 'Magical' about the place. All of the staff are beyond friendly, they just go out of their way to 'make' the experience. It's exceptionally clean, has reasonably (theme-park) priced food and snacks, and just small enough to do in one day (2 days if you want to do the DisneySea bit, which we didn't). Family friendly, with the Log Ride and Splash Mountain being the only 2 real 'thrill' rides- but they are definitely fun and popular! Get a Fast Pass for these ones, well worth the wait of ~ 2-4hrs+ each!

Oh, and about those fast passes, you can only have one (1) at a time! So get there early, pick your 'must-do' rides, grab a fastpass from the machine (next to the ride queue) for the next available- then as soon as you have done that one, get the pass for the next one and so on. The time in between can be spent on other, smaller/shorter wait rides. :)

Free (included) travel on the JR Keiyo/Chuo lines, via Tokyo Station to Maihama (Disneyland)- allow at least 20mins each way. Definitely recommend buying a pre-paid day entry pass in advance, and go on a weekday to avoid the long lines!","Written July 1, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

1782,Quality Entertainment,"We went there at around lunch time - which is not good... If your'e planning to experience all the rides & the shows, be there at around 8am as the average waiting time is around 30-45 minutes per ride...Front gate personnels don't have an english Disney Land Guide Map unlike Disney Sea. The park is well maintained - no garbages, smokers have their own stations & the people (Japanese) are very disciplined - no one will get ahead of you in line, they won't stand up at the middle of a show etc etc.. We also went to Star Trek tours - a new ride/attraction in disneyland which opened last May 7 (we went there on May 10). The queue's too long, you have to wait for 2hrs or more (this is usually the case for newly opened rides)..even the FASTPASS IS NOT THAT FAST - we got our FP tickets at around lunch, the FP ticket time was at 7-8pm just to ride this one. The effects/place was really impressive & there were moving R2d2 & C-3PO which is kinda cool even if you're not a star wars fan. The only downside overall is that all shows are in Japanese language - which makes some of the shows, well, a little boring cause you can't understand a single thing :( We also had the chance to see (reserved seating) One Man's Dream (stage performance) & the stage effects, props, choreography are really amazing - it compensates for the language barrier...lol!

1783,"Another Disney, another Continent","I have visited Disney in Florida and Disney near Paris, both times with my kids. This time it was Disney , Tokyo with my Grandson and his Mum. On the face of it, they were all very similar with the same attractions. Disney Tokyo is on a smaller site. The good news was shorter walking between rides, the bad is the queues seemed much longer. Maybe it was just very busy, but judging by the car park and what I have been told, this was a quiet Friday! I suppose I should also say that my grandson is only 2 1/2 years old and in all honesty 2 years too young. Don't get me wrong he loved it especially the electric parade, but queuing for 40 minutes is really too much to ask of him. The Disney theme continues to endure and it's pretty much a standard product. This was a shame because Tokyo could have been more Japanese and less American and been the better for it. The food was US and not up to standard. Take your own and save a fortune, as many Japanese visitors did. To really get the best from Disney you need to plan carefully. Start EARLY and hit the most popular rides while the queue is short. Lunchtime people are eating so eat earl (or late) and make the most of the slack time. Don't take your own buggy, hire one. Though expensive it's still a fantastic day you will never forget whatever age you are. Finally one strange thing about Tokyo is the number of unaccompanied adults. It seems no matter how old we all enjoy the magic, just glad I had my grandson to superviseüòé","Written May 18, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1784,Disney style with Japanese substance,"I visited here back in 1996 and a lot has changed since then. A monorail has appeared, several hotels and a whole new park 'Disneysea'. I have fond memories of this park as it was actually the first one I ever visited. I still think it probably has the best 'Castle' of any of the 'Magic Kingdom' parks.

Ride wise it has Space and Splash mountains, the haunted house, Pirates of the Caribbean, Winnie the Pooh, Big thunder mountain and a few other ones. Space mountain, out of all the worlds non-inverting one's I reckon this one is by far the best, it's in total darkness where as some of the others leak a lot of light. Winnie the Pooh is also different from other versions and is technologically very advanced. Haunted house and other rides are pretty identical to other world versions. 'It's a small world' is just as irritating here as it is anywhere else.

What sets this park apart though is the parades and the shear attention to detail. Can you imagine being in a USA park and everyone sitting down nicely when told to do so? We were sat about 15 feet from the rope yet still had a great view as everyone was just so well behaved. You have the feeling that if someone stood up at the wrong time an impeccable dressed employee would develop a Samurai sword from nowhere and a head would roll. Coming from the west it's just very different but it's beautiful to be a part of and appreciate it all. The attention to detail is stunning in all aspects, be it the parade or even just the servers in a 'Churro' truck. You will not find an employee that can't speak at least two languages and all were very forgiving and understanding of my very bad Japanese pronunciation (although I get the feeling that they do appreciate the effort, even if they do confirm what you've asked for in English). We experienced impeccable service and politeness during our entire stay. If you get the opportunity to come here, do, you will not regret the experience. It contains nothing really new if you've experienced the other parks in the world, but the people do separate this one apart.","Written May 17, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1785,When you wish upon a star...,"In April 2013, we visited Disneyland Tokyo for the first time. As expected, most of the attractions are quite similar with the one in Paris. But the most challenging (and quite annoying part) is that they are using Japanese in most of the attractions. So if you are not native speakers or fluent in Japanese, maybe you won't be really enjoying much.

Apart from the language barrier, you may not see any unique collections of souvenirs as you can find easily in Paris. They are very standard items such as clothings, toys, stationeries etc.

Since we went there during weekdays, the queue was not so long. In average, we could 'enjoy' around 40 minutes of waiting time.

However Disneyland is still in our heart at its best. I have been to Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea several times and I love it in each visits.

My advice is do go to Disneyland during weekdays and avoid during any public holidays, Golden Week holidays, Obon Holidays and new Year holidays to enjoy the rides.

The crowd in Tokyo Disneyland can be overwhelming as it is very popular among Asian tourists and local Japanese. Best to visit Monday to Thursday and plan ahead where to go. We managed to cover a record 11 rides this time! Do check ahead at the website for locations of the special events. The Nightime Parade is quite spectacular but it's freezing cold in winter so be prepared with warm clothing's. Don't be surprised with a fair bit of shopping as the merchandise here are quite attractive with some unique items available or being sold here first. Departing from the theme park, we find it easier to take the Disneyland bus rather the train where you need to walk some 15-20min (with kids) to reach the station.

Japan's Disney Sea is the equivalent of California Adventures. The place was great. I loved the different themes such as the Little Mermaid and Aladdin. Of course, the park was very clean. Loved the different kinds of popcorn flavors sold throughout the park and the different sorts of pastries. The park was also very friendly for families with strollers. Most of the rides were child friendly especially for 3 year olds. Overall the experience was great and I wouldn't mind going back again and again maybe when my son gets older. Only note is to make sure you've got spending money especially if you want to bring home souvenirs and do miscellaneous shopping at the park. The only disadvantage if needed be mention is that most of the shows were in Japanese (which is expected being in Japan) but the nice thing is they provided little monitor looking gadgets which provide English subtitles.","Written February 19, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
1797,A world of dreams,"Its so wrong to think that Disneyland is only for the children. It is for everyone, from the very young to the seniors.
A fairytale land where one can just forget about the world outside and enjoy themselves.

There are things just about for anyone.

Most of the rides are catered for the family and younger children, so they tend to be mild. Still, there are some more thrilling ones; a personal favourite being the Space Mountain.

I had to battle the crowds even when I visited on a weekday. There were tourists and locals swarming the park.

Entrance tickets can be purchased online, at the Disney store in Shibuya or at the park entrance itself. The only thing about buying tickets at the park itself? You will have to wait and queue.

Food outlets are located all over the park, so are souvenir shops.

It would be good to check out when the daily parade takes place. Not sure if there is a fixed timing for it. If so, it is at 2pm on weekdays. This is when the various Disney characters appear in song and dance, going past the waving crowd.

Photo-taking with individual characters can also be done.. but it was really tough with the more popular characters. What with so many people vying for their attention!

Fireworks are not on every evening. Please check the park calendar and schedule if you are visiting to see the fireworks.

Operating hours of the park varies too!! Please check their website.

As an American, I relished in the idea of it snowing at a Disney park. It's magical in an entirely new way. That being said, if you visit in Winter, be warned! The day I went, the forecast was rainy and 40 degrees F. It rapidly became a slushy, snowy pile up. Luckily the park sells many ponchos and umbrellas.

Weather aside, the park is very enjoyable, even in the rain/snow. It is very spacious compared to it's California counterpart and more modern. The rides are different than in California, but it doesn't have as many of them.","Written January 20, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Heaps of great rides - some of the little kid rides (Peter Pan, mostly) are great for adults too, just for the amazing detail and thought that's gone into each one.

No real thrill rides - a major plus in my book! But lots and lots of fun. Especially Splash Mountain. :)

Fantastic shows, shops, rides, food. Light years better than any Australian theme park!

Lines can get up to a couple of hours, so get the Fast Pass if it's available - it means you come back at a particular time and get in the Express Queue.

FOOD ALLERGIES AND TOKYO DISNEYLAND:
I visited most recently in 2012 with my gluten free brother. It's actually pretty good for food intolerances/allergies. At the restaurants (the fancier ones, not the takeaway outlets) they will have an allergy free set-meal. So you'll get a drink, meal item and dessert. About 1000 yen, so not very expensive, either and won't contain wheat, egg, dairy, nuts... I don't remember what else, but all the major allergies.

I compare Tokyo Disneyland to the fun I had in Disney World while growing up. Just amazingly fun, but this time as an adult with my husband. Even have the castle, which is a staple I grew up on. (Which I recently found out, to my trip to Disneyland in California, they only have a tiny castle.)

This particular park does have it's own Japanese atmosphere, but it's still an amazing place, and you see so many young folks and families come here for fun. It's got two parks. Disneyland itself and Disney Sea. Disney Sea, while it may have one or two rides I can recall for kids, seems to be more adult oriented. Disney Sea is what has things like Tower of Terror and all. Each is worth a visit on a separate day for maximum fun.

There might be some slight altercations to things to fit in with the culture. I know with the Tower of Terror is Disney Sea, it incorporates Stitch (from Lilo and Stitch) into the story before you ride on it. That is something I do not remember being in the US version.

Not nearly as crowded at Disney Tokyo (never more than a 20 minute wait for rides/attractions and mostly no wait at all).

I didn't think it was so horribley crowded as to make for a bad visit. Most of the classic rides are in good form - except for Space Mountain which is closed for renovation. Star Tours is also closed.. a bummer. I loved Cinderella's Castle. The Easter Egg hunt going on is fun and it's entertaining to see the characters hidden around the park.

The uncertain weather forecast must have scared a lot of folks away because the longest we waited for 20 minutes for the Hunny Hunt. I would highly recommend fast-passing Splash Mountain as the line for this attraction is ALWAYS long. There isn't much for vegetarians but if you can handle lots of popcorn and some dairy, you will survive (as I did). The food options were a little lacking but the prices weren't as exorbitant as I'd expected things to be. Most rides were child-friendly and all rides are at least 'big kid' friendly (you have to be at least 110cm to do the 'big kid' rides).
If you have time, I would highly recommend the electrical parade. There is just something whimsical and magical about the floats, the dancers, and of course, that irritating electrical parade tune. Watching the bright lights and all definitely fueled the inner-child in me, it was great.
The fire works show however, was pretty lame and not really worth watching...

We went on a cloudy, grim Tuesday in February thinking that it would not be crowded. Alas. We did not understand how much the Japanese love their Disney.

The familiarity of the Magic Kingdom/Disneyland experience, viewed through the Japanese lens, was a once in a lifetime opportunity. We spent the day comparing the crowd (the Japanese dress up for the occasion, where as the Florida crowd shows a lot more skin ... not that they should) and the food (curry popcorn!) and the rides. There are a lot more Mickey, Pooh, and Tigger fans and a lot fewer princesses. The Pooh ride is very different than the US versions, highly recommended even if you have to wait in the standby line. ""It's A Small World"" is pretty much the same.

It's not cheap (nothing in Tokyo is) but, based on the crowd, and our experiences over our 10 days there, there is a cultural element that makes it absolutely valuable to visit - particularly when traveling with a tween.","Written April 19, 2012",4.0 of 5 bubbles

We'd timed our visit so our daughter (who teaches English at Japanese schools) could look after us. It was therefore holiday time, and so the park was at bursting point. They closed the park for entry at about 10am, but they should have done so even earlier as the queues were getting silly. For example there was a 60 minute queue for Small, Small World and it was also about 60 minutes to queue for the Fast Pass tickets for Splash Mountain. There were 30 minute queues for popcorn! As other's have reported some rides were queuing for over 200 minutes.

The park itself was lovely but we'd only managed to get on 3 of the ""bigger"" rides by noon - the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Jungle Cruise. We then stopped for lunch at the Hungry Bear Restaurant and had some very nice curries.

After lunch we switched to the ""smaller"" events and the queues were much smaller - we did ""the Enchanted Tiki Room"", the ""Country Bear Theatre"", the"" Mark Twain riverboat"", and the show at ""Showbase"". After this I'd felt much happier to be doing things rather than just standing in queues.

It did seem that there was a lot of queue jumping taking place, with one person joining the queue for a group and the rest of the family joining them later. I was told that this is the norm in Tokyo Disneyland as the queues are quite often bad and people drop out of the queues to go to rest rooms or get drinks and return, but I think quite a few were being a bit ""naughty"".

Park was not crowded as expected but the queue is still long for the popular rides, i shudder to think how bad the lines can be if it was crowded. I missed a few of the rides due to long queues

It took less than 30mins for us to clear the queue to buy the tickets and enter the park (after it just opened 30mins before)

We saw the characters parade in the afternoons and the evenings.

1823,Not Florida but a good substitute,"Travelled in December 2011 with friends

Travelled with friends aged 19/20 and we all still loved disneyland! Makes you feel like a child again! We were lucky enough to visit during the Christmas period so there were so many beautiful christmas decorations.

We took a bus from Shinjuku station, the ride was comfortable and it cost us 700yen 1 way. Alot of the rides I must say are more for children. They're weren't many high speed or thrilling rides at all. We loved Splash mountain and our favorite was Space mountain (we went on it twice).

Food is pricey but a range is available. All in all a magical day!

P.S The Turkey leg is overrated! Me and my friends were so excited to try it because of the numerous reviews about how amazing they are on tripadvisor. We were so dissapointed! It tasted plain and smelt bad (probably needed some gravy?) But worth trying yourself, because the line was sooo long and we saw people sitting around eating it ... and nodding in satisfaction?? So probably best if you try it out yourself. Not the cheapest at 500yen per turkey stick.","Written March 3, 2012",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Almost every people in here was wearing those cutey Mickey Head accessories thingy.. when most people wore it.. it really made the theme parks MORE alive..

Mickey`s everywhere!! although the line was quite long..

In October, you should really use rain boots because it did raining some times..

My son is 7 yrs old the the majority of attractions were perfect for him. The queues on this day were pretty much non exsistant due to the timing of the reopening and it was a Tuesday.
I had been a few times in years gone by and had struck days where the queuing was at least 2hrs/ ride! This time we arrived at 1pm and had plently of time to do everything we wanted by 9pm. The Electric parade was gorgeous and even though there were no fire works and most of the park was quite dark due to power conservation that only added to the atmoshere.
Well worth the visit and highly recomended!

It was her second trip to Japan and Tokyo Disneyland with us (we had a trip there last year-2010) and she absolutely loves the Parks of course. She is also very taken with the culture of Japan and would love to be able to visit there more often. All in all a very successful and enjoyable trip.

The people were friendly - both the guests and workers. A lot of rides are in Japanese, but of course, it didn't matter. A must-see for any Disney fan!

1835,Good...not great. queuing could be improved,"The rides here are not good - think alton towers ten / fifteen years ago, and the queues are quite bad. The queues to get in are the worst though, as the system simply doesn't seem to make any sense and they move people to different queues for unknown reasons. we arrived at 8:50 and didn't enter the park until 9:40. a previous traveller said to make sure you get a map in english at the gates - good call! everywhere else the maps are japanese. the shows etc are also in Japanese, but still enjoyable, and dont require queueing for ages!
They have a fast pass system, but often there is a 30 min queue just for that, but this is better than the 1 hour minimum queue for the smaller rides and a 2/3 hour wait for the larger ones.
They have a lot of staff, and the place is spotless, perhaps more people could be used to entertain the queues!
the Japanese seem to LOVE so sit to be entertained, and they spread out mats along the parade route an HOUR before it starts...i wouldn't worry, there are plenty of vantage points, and the parades are great - the highlight of the day.
i would suggest taking food with you, as it is very pricey.

overall a good day, but if you want to go on all the rides you will need more than 1 day and a LOT of patience. ( i went on a Thursday, off peak season no holidays etc and it was still busier and the queues were worse than a school holiday weekend at alton towers!)

1836,awesome family experience,"We spent one day at Tokyo Disneyland last summer with two small children (3 and 5). We had a great time and will definitely visit again.

It's important to buy tickets in advance and - if you want the most ouf of your day - arrive at least an hour before they open. You'll see a line-up already! Make a plan, check the rides and the map, once they open the door the crowd will be overwhelming, but if you run, you can get to your favourite ride with no need to wait. From that point, expect 1-2 hours wait for the popular rides. We had an exact plan what we wanted to try, one of us lined-up and the other went around with the kids to meet the characters in the park. My kids got to meet all princesses and the crowd around them wasn't as bad as it was around Mickey and Minnie Mouse. To meet Mickey, we had to wait more than 2 hours.
If you want to watch shows, make sure to be there very early, all sitting and standing places fill up quick. Most people bring a mat to sit to watch shows and the parade.","Written February 21, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The rides have all the typical Disney magic you would find in Orlando and the people are fun to watch (people in matching Disney outfits, big groups with mouse ears and Mickey gloves - has to be seen to be beleived). The Disney Halloween celebrations (Parades, shows) had kicked off already and those were as good as the rides. Overall if you love Disney parks you'll love this one. Just be sure to go mid-week to avoid crowds. The only negative we found at all was that the food was a bit off our tastes.

1839,Still the happiest place in the world,"Nowhere what it used to be. Have been going for more than 30 years and it seems to be all about pinching the penny these days. You can no longer ride the major attractions more than once (Soaring, Toy Story). The all you can eat restaurants are gone. The food prices have gone up and the portions haven gotten smaller. They have cut off Wifi in some restaurants to increase table turnovers - which is not a bad idea, but some folks like a little Wifi while eating. Tickets are almost impossible to get. The ticket scalping has gotten out of control - I believe they are working on this now. The new attractions have been disasters. Closing down 'day at the races' and replacing it with Beauty and the Beast is a Big, BIG BIG mistake. They should have gone EV. The attractions are not going full tilt. They lie and tell you that they are doing maintenance. The stock may be going up and up but the park itself is going down and down. Maybe this is the sign of the times. Disney used to have great value, now it is just someplace like a park where you walk around in circles taking in smells and scenery - sort of VR ish. I don't mind paying more for value but it is not here. You are paying more for mediocre business decisions. This is entertainment and using the Covid as an excuse to take everything away while increasing prices will eventually make folks reevaluate Universal Studios.

1843,Disney Mad Crush Not a Great Experience,"Went on the 5th April and it was an absolute mad scramble. Although not during school holidays and during weekday, the number of people queuing up by 7:30am was enormous. We could not work out which queue was for tickets and which was for entry.

When the gates opened, it was like the running of the bulls at Pamplona and many people running in with heaps of pushing and shoving. After seeing many young kids cry near the Buzz light year ride to shoot those aliens, I really did question why one would want to bring their child here.

It is impossible to get on every ride in one day and using the fastpass system allows you get on more than you would. It very much is catered to locals with many having a yearly pass.

I was also surprised that people start hogging spots for the parade from 10am in the morning and it creates a hazard and slows you down. Frankly Disney should stop people squatting for seats so early.

My tip is run for the furthest rides away from the entry that are good and then move to get your first fastpass while you line up for your next ride and then just repeat getting fastpasses when you can for the big rides.

However by 1pm, many attractions have already closed for fastpasses. For example Thunder mountain ride fastpass obtained at 11am was for a ride at 5pm.

Tells you that Disney are admitting too many people in one day to be able to enjoy the experience.

The night is a massive crush to, so you are better off watching the parade from the Western World. Restaurant food - you are also looking at at least 800Yen per person over and probably closer to 1,300Yen for a proper meal and that's not even in the top notch restaurant.","Written April 28, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles

The wait for popular rides is usually over an hour if you don‚Äôt use the fast pass system. Scan your entry ticket once per hour at the fast pass booths next to the ride and in an hour or so you can join the fast line which moves much faster.
I found it best to get your fast pass as soon as you get off each ride and enjoy some side shows in between to ensure you spend as little time in lines as possible.","Written April 28, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

After a little disappointing day at the DisneySea (see my other review), this made us feel back home and happy again.

Specially doing the classic rides Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain gave us the Disney experience we wanted. And the night light parade was amazing!

There are some things they should do something about to make it even better in my eyes:
1) I know this is a Japanese park, but this is the only park in the world with next to no English on their rides. Thus making the dark rides almost useless, and a little more difficult for international visitors.

2) They MUST do something about how many people they let in! There actually must be a way to have a full capacity and sell out because it was really over crowded. This was even on a regular weekday and we were told it is twice as many during the weekends, which must be unbearable. Tokyo is a huge city and most people can afford the steap Disney prices so something needs to be done!

3) The official Disney stores products both inside and outside the park was not up to standard. On every single Disney we've been to in the world the suitcase have been filled with quality Disney merch such as limited edition artwork etc. This was not to be found at any stores in Tokyo, although we found some better quality products at the Disney Store in Shibuya.","Written April 19, 2019",3.0 of 5 bubbles

The Peter Pan ride was a family favourite, as was the Buzz Lightyear ride. The older kid/adult loved Space Mountain. The It's a Small World ride was a strange one, go on it if you want the song stuck in your head for the next year and if you want to feel like Lisa Simpson when she was tripping. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was pretty good too. The parade is a must to watch, day and night. Plenty of characters wandering around, they do get mobbed but as the park wasn't crazy busy we managed to get some photos with them. Food was pretty good, there's a good selection available including for fussy kids. We especially loved the Mickey Mouse mini pizzas. It was a shame that some rides were closed in Toon Town while we were there, my husband was very sad he couldn't go on the Roger Rabbit ride lol. If you go in winter make sure you stop in the jail in Toon Town, there are heater vents which are delightful to stand under and defrost! Merch is expensive, as one would expect, but there is a big variety. Overall a fab place to spend a day/evening. We all loved it!

We went on a really cold day, but we still had a ton of fun watching the parade. And I would really recommend the Stitch show. It was hilarious particularly to adults.

The park is very English friendly if you need to speak English. The only real drawback are the lines. The lines are pretty intense unless you go on a weekday which kind of sucks. Because the lines at the Florida one are so much shorter.

A 3 hour wait time just isn't that unusual. But if you're willing to split up the single rider lines are awesome. The Buzz Lightyear ride was awesome as always. And Pooh's Honey Hunt, It's a small World, and the Haunted Mansion were all worth seeing.

The queues weren‚Äôt as bad as expected (5-10min queue to get in) although the morning was a little rainy so may have put people off. The popular rides were longer waits (space mountain, roller coasters, log ride etc). In any case the rides notify you at line up the expected wait time so you can decide before joining the queue if you are up for the wait. The staff were everywhere and very helpful, happy & smiley. We watched the night time parade which was hands down the best parade we‚Äôve ever seen, worth securing a spot on the route for. Overall we all had a fab day, it felt like we were in a magical land removed from the real world. Oh and highly recommend the Jungle Cruise in Adventureland, unexpectedly awesome.","Written March 12, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

It managed to make a pair of forty somethings feel like kids again with stylish rides and great shows. The queue times are an issue, making repeating popular rides like Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain impractical, but there's plenty to do still. The electric lights parade and the fireworks are a must see and we were lucky enough to catch the 35th anniversary show, which was amazing. The food available is okay and reasonably priced without being amazing and the park is incredibly clean. Would happily visit again. The only issue we had was our card not being accepted online so we had to buy a ticket on the day - Tokyo Disney, please sort out your payment portal as this was a real hassle.","Written March 11, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles
1872,Nice day at Disneyland,"We spent the day at Disneyland and had a nice day with the kids. This place is nice for younger kids maybe 3 to 12 years old. Not too many exciting rides for teenager.

Clean environment and interesting shops, restaurants and rides. Queue can be long for some rides.

We especially liked the parades. There is a parade during the day and a night time parade which is really colourful. Try and catch both the parades as well as the fireworks at the end of the night. One thing which we found strange was that the fireworks should have come immediately after the night parade. But instead, we had to wait another half hour to see the short fireworks display.

It was a little too cold for some of us as it was winter. Probably better to come during better weather like spring or autumn.","Written March 9, 2019",4.0 of 5 bubbles

1881,We had fun for slightly more than two days here.,"We bought the vacation package which includes a certain amount of fast passes. Therefore, we need not join the public to queue for certain time slot‚Äôs fast passes for those popular rides. My girl‚Äôs current height is more suitable for Disneyland, in comparison to DisneySea.
She is very happy that she is guaranteed entry (as she is a guest at the Disney hotels) even on crowded days, also the fact that the fast passes we had can be used at any time slot (during the operation timing of the park) and skipped the long waiting time (we still need to wait but much much faster than those who do not have fast passes...for example, the normal waiting time for those without fast passes will be 90mins while we only waited about 15mins).
We bought lots of popcorn holders (different themes) and tasted at least 3 different flavours out of the available flavours.
I purposely arranged this trip to tap on the 35th anniversary before it ends on mid March this year but the popcorn holder (Mickey Mouse with the 35th anniversary symbol) was sold out.
But well, i managed to get the other ornament item which strongly signifies this anniversary, so I am still contented.
I personally strongly encourage families with young children to consider purchasing the vacation package (no such package for Hong Kong Disneyland which we went in October 2016), as it brings lots of convenience despite that my husband and I do not understand Japanese and speak extremely limited Japanese.","Written February 26, 2019",5.0 of 5 bubbles

A place that makes dream comes true! A pity that we didn't have time to take photo with any of the characters. Kind of sad thinking about it now. But we actually conquer quite a number of rides. The queue for the rides are quite manageable.

All I could say was one day here is definitely not enough. Try to plan ahead by getting the fast pass to some of the rides as well as the lottery chance for the performance. F&B queue are definitely long and so we had to settle on something quick like a Mickey hand-shaped bun / giant turkey drumstick / snacking on popcorn from the Willy design bucket.

In Japan there are two parks side by side: Tokyo Disney and Tokyo DisneySea!
The first was done in the mold of Disneyland in California and the Magic Kingdom in Florida.

Disney is divided into 7 worlds or theme lands.
It goes from the western / western old style to the extreme future with Star Wars.

From the drinking fountains, trash bins and warning signs.

Lines in most rides are very long (60-90 min wait time) so Fast Pass and Single Rider are your best friends, make sure to make good use of them so you can enjoy all the rides in the park.

Thunder Mountain Railroad is way better than Disneyland Hollywood. It's my favorite Disney ride ever and the one in Tokyo is at par with Hong Kong's, in my opinion. Classic rides such as Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan, It's A Small World are a must. You can ride Jungle Cruise at night for a different feel. Star Tours have zero line so ride it anytime.

1909,The happiest place on earth,"To skip the line on the entry gate, its highly recomended for you to purchase the ticket in advance. And make sure to keep the ticket since you will need that to get the FASTPASS.

First, once you enter the park, just go directly to the Fastpass machine as soon as possible to get the ticket for the favourite rides. after you collect the Fastpass ticket, then you can enjoy the other rides that do not provide the Fastpass ticket.
This is how you skip the waiting line and enjoy the park as much as possible.

If you do not into some parades, just skip it as well, since it will takes about 1 hour (or more) for you to wait and keep the seat on the street. You really need to manage your time well spent to maximize all the rides in Tokyo Disneyland. Considering that in the regular time (weekdays and not peak season) the park itself can be very very crowded.

Do some research before visit the park, you can browse the Tokyo Disneyland official website to choose which rides that you wish to play include the park maps.

As advised we headed straight for the fast pass for the Pooh ride. At that time there was already a long line waiting to get a fast pass.
We got other fast passes during the day but unfortunately several clashed with the parades.
We ate at Tomorrowland dinner the foud was basic but reasonably priced. By being selective we were able to complete 15 rides in the day waiting no more than 20 minutes for any ride. We took in two parades the best being the evening Electric Parade which was spectacular. You need to claim a good seating spot at least an hour before the parade commences.

The 10% that doesn‚Äôt really work is Adventure Land.

Adventure land is a mishmash or random classic Disney attractions smashed together with a very vague theme. Many of the rides are fine, but how they connect to each other doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. The railroad, also found at Adventure Land, is one of the most disappointing trains in all of the castle parks. The main difference is that the train doesn‚Äôt stop anywhere else except the Adventure Land station. So while it‚Äôs a fun ride, it lacks the usability of the trains at other parks.

When we visited there was a lot of construction going on, but other than a huge wall connecting Toon Town (our favourite land) and Tomorrow Land it was fairly unobtrusive.","Written November 25, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Pro tip for rides, grab the fast pass for the popular rides like Winnie the Pooh first thing you enter. Simply enjoy the park and parades during the day, ride queues considerably shorten after 8pm, mainly as families with young kids would have left by then. But if you are visiting during school holidays when teenagers are the bulk...

1934,Not sure how I would rate this,"We spent 5 days in Disney California and to be honest could have spent more !!!

Disney Tokyo not sure how I feel ... I was careful to book as per their calendar and book a light day but when we arrived ( early) there was literally thousands of people and I mean thousands ... not sure they stop selling tickets ... we moved with the flood of people and it was difficult to really look at anything in the main area.

We spent up to an hour in line for each ride ( remember this was marked as a quiet day) and the kids felt the rides were all the same . Everything is in Japanese does not really cater for foreigners but was an experience.

I am such a fan of Disney so I loved the experience but would of been concerned if it was a super hot day as no cover at all.

As a ride fan family I would call it a soft park ... my kids prefer the adventure park experience and for what it cost us to do one day in a Tokyo we paid for 5 in the USA.

They agreed it was better than HK Disney and Shanghai Disney even though Tokyo‚Äôs was more crowded. Perhaps it‚Äôs the immaculate lines and how people quietly wait for their turn in line. No one ‚Äúcuts‚Äù the line here. The staff here were also very friendly and were all smiles.

Food was decent. We liked the pizza. The popcorn was good too. My 6 year old really wanted the plastic popcorn container of various Disney Characters that everyone had but at 2200 it was a bit pricey. The gift stores were unique with tons of Disney merchandise.

They had the Disney Halloween parade which was very nice. The park overall was a little more crowded that the Sea park, but everything was done in an orderly fashion Japanese style, and that made it nice. We didn‚Äôt really do too many rides because it was pretty crowded, but the ones we did we did with a fast pass. We wanted to go see Mickey and Minnie but the wait was a little too long for our toddler (2 yrs old) . We saw Minnie at Sea-park with only a 35 minute wait. I would go back without a toddler.

Tokyo Disney land focuses on smaller but larger capacity rides such as the river boat , and the river cruise to prevent frustration and long waiting time.

This is what customer service is all about.

One thing that really bump us out is that Disney introduce this DUFFY characther that suppose to be Mickey‚Äôs teddy bear.

For Disney to introduce new characther is nothing new, but the eliminate almost all the merchandise (the main character) to focus on this new ones is silly.

1974,Too Crowded,"One experience we could have save ourselves during our Japan stay. Too crowded, space mountain closed, fast passes were already gone when we arrived at 9:30am and avg waiting time at the key rides exceeded 2 hrs. Not worth it. We should have better visited Fuji-Q highland park instead which has more exciting roller coasters and far less visitors.

Learnings from the day:

1) Be early:
We visited Disneyland with our three children 7, 11 and 14 years. While we went during the week and arrived at 9:30am the Fast passed were already gone. If you want a smooth experience be at the park at 8:00am sharp, head directly to the key attractions and collect your Fast Passes there at the vending machines. Fast passes are free and only valid and available for individual rides so plan your visit and key attractions you want to see in advance.

2) Great for younger kids. Take teenagers to Fuji-Q Highland unless they are into Disney:

I had been to EuroDisney a number of times in the past. The last time 10 years ago. While Disneyland Tokyo is comparable in size and rides my kids (11 and 14) prefer more faster rollercoasters. As space mountain was closed for maintenance Big Thunder Mountain did not really excite them and the waiting time for splash mountain was in excess of 2 hours.
The Haunted House was not scary as well. So most rides were great for my 7 year old while my teenagers were bored.

3) Popcorn:

Popcorn seems to be a highlight in the park. Watch out though. While there are many popcorn stations, each one sells a different flavor. The flavors and location of the stations are indicated on the map. Check the flavor before queuing for 15 minutes to get a bag of popcorn that is not the right flavor.

Overall the park is very clean, staff are the most friendliest staff in the world and it can be a great day out with if planned right and you are ok with crowds.

The electric light parade was especially well done, but the long lines and attempt to get a time stamp resulted in getting a reservation for 12 hours later - sorry, not really helpful.

1977,Full day of Disney fun and food,"Buy your ticket before arriving to avoid standing in line at the ticket window. The staff is very polite even during the bag search at the entrance. Get your Fast Passes at the popular rides first thing. The Honey Bear attraction seemed to be popular with the younger kids. Space Mountain wasn't in operation. There is the upbeat Disney music near the Main Street entrance and we even watched a small group of Disney performers in futuristic space costumes doing a singing and beatbox performance in the middle of the day. The shaved ice flavors seemed to vary according to where you are in the park. The matcha shaved ice was in Adventureland and it was a wonderful and refreshing snack to have during the hot day. It came with a dollop of sweet adzuki and an alien mochi dumpling on top. I had to ask an employee where the matcha flavor shaved ice was offered. The park does have other flavors of shaved ice like orange at other locations. Ask an employee because they have a map of where these can be found. The queues are long, but the system is very efficient. Star Tours was my favorite even if it was all in Japanese. Try to ride it more than once to see the different videos. There are employees helping senior citizens with canes and wheelchair guests enter and exit Star Tours through a different door. One female employee who helped the handicapped guests at Star Tours on June 8, Sato san, even took the time to speak to me (in Japanese) about my taking refuge under the tree to escape the heat while I ate my pizza. It's the small things that make Tokyo Disneyland special. I would suggest eating lunch an hour before or an hour after the major noon lunch crowd. It was difficult to get a table to sit down at during the peak lunch rush so people were eating outside and sitting on low walls or even sitting on the ground. In Tokyo Disneyland, people stood in line patiently, employees took pride in their jobs, and it was the most orderly crowd I have seen at an amusement park. It was fairly easy to get to on the subway. Like other Disneyland parks, the experience is fun for people of all ages.

Shows were fun and entertaining, and of course all the cast members are the picture of politeness and efficiency that you would expect from Japan.

Space mountain has fabulous view of the various cartoon characters along the ride and although some of the signature rides for kids are closed during that period (Pooh‚Äôs hunny hunt and it‚Äôs a small world), we still think it‚Äôs quite worth while to visit. The queen of hearts banquet hall is a sight to behold! And the legendary various popcorn flavors with the quite expensive containers are sought after.

1997,Not the Best Disney but visit it anyway,"We had visited, Eurodisney, California, Florida and Hong Kong before coming to Tokyo, with the basis of our experience I have to say the Tokyo Disneyland is not the best of the parks we have visited.

The main issue is I have to say the crowds, we went on a Tuesday during school time, where according to the local info it would be circa 50% capacity, it was however absolutely packed, I dread to think what it would have been on a peak day.

The other downside is the fast pass system is fully embraced here and it is quite normal for fast passes to be fully issued before lunchtime for some rides (kind of defeats the object in our view)

On the plus side the staff are very friendly and their are a couple of unique rides, catering is a little unique as well with some interesting choices

2000,Madly Busy Even in The Week,"You gotta love Disney it has a captive audience. However, I have never been to one that is so busy even in the week. This means massive long waiting times and sitting down for an hour before a parade to ensure you get a good view! That said at least as you sit down for the parade there is no pushing or shoving from people behind.

There is a severe lack of Disney princesses to have photos taken with as there is no princess pavilion.

There are nice opportunities at the entrance for photos with other characters and the merchandise stores seem cheaper than Paris or Orlando. The food selection is typical of what you would expect at a Disney park!

There is a nice area called toon town which young kids love. They can wonder in and out of the characters houses.

In slightly windy weather they cancel the fireworks and if it‚Äôs slightly raining our night parade was cancelled too!

The wait for many of the rides are long, as they don't have FastPass for Hauted Mansion, It's A Small World and Jungle Cruise. The wait times for Splash Mountain and Buzz Lightyear are crazy! However, unlike Shanghai Disneyland, people are relatively nice and wait their turn. However, just like Shanghai Disneyland, they charge for the FastPass which is just wrong in my opinion. The food here is odd, as the western food like the foot long hot is more Japanese flavour than western. The Japanese like the Chinese buy everything, but not t-shirts or pins to trade.

Knowing this we were there just after it opened and walked straight in. The rides were great fun and being my first Disney experience, I was very impressed. Pirates of the Caribbean was my favourite for the day, I had high blood pressure so the most thrilling attraction I did was Star Tours. Our longest wait was about 40-50 minutes for the Haunted Mansion and this was at peak time. The waiting goes quick with the distraction of your surroundings and if you have company. The staff knew little English in my experience and spoke Japanese on all rides unless there was an animatronic, not a complaint at all considering this is Japan, but something to point out for any foreigners wondering.

2023,Happiest Place On Earth,"Whilst a smaller version of the USA Disneyland parks still great to visit.

Easy to get to by Disney monorail /train.

Very limited English spoken in this park and all shows 90% of rides are in Japanese no English so it‚Äôs a shame for tourists as other parks like Hong Kong, Paris accommodate tourists. However this park has so many Japanese visit I doubt they need foreign tourists to make money anyway. Really aimed at the locals.

Priced like most Disney‚Äôs 3 day pass about $220 Australian each
1 day at Disneyland
1 day at DisneySea
3rd day can go between both

Fireworks were not as good as other Disney‚Äôs and are not over the castle like others not sure why.

Food pretty average and pricey mainly Japanese food few simple dishes around.

Rides were good
Well kept park

Seems locals avoid these parks when it is raining even a little rain, so a great time to go.

Good to go between Monday-Thursday avoid Fridays and weekends and really good weather as the crowds on these days are insane..

If you can stay after fireworks the parks empty quick and you can get on most rides easily between 8.30-10pm

Some rides no lines at all and fast passes are available at the rides in the park for allocated times. But popular ones go quick.
Longest line we saw was 60 minutes in the week.

Everything is just familiar enough, and different enough, to the interesting all-day long .. ..

All the food is OISHII and of course, STAFF is amazing .. .. And, everyone had no problems with English .. .. Enjoyed trying all the POPCORN types .. .. By far the best was CURRY, followed by MISO & BUTTER .. .. Try them all .. ..

And, despite the winds cancelling all the PARADES & FIREWORKS, we all had a great time .. .. And, if you see anything interesting to buy ~ BUY IT! Chances are no other park in the world will have it .. ..

Getting to Disneyland wasn't hard with the Tokyo train system but if you can afford to stay at the resort for a couple of days, I would suggest it. The lines were long so make use of the fast pass system. You can your ticket at the booths and get an ""appointment"" to return for a shorter line.

2052,"Disney makes for magic moments, but some mixed feelings with Tokyo","Disney make happy memories and I had a good time there but there are some things they could really improve.

Information Boards - Shanghai have got this spot on, lots of information at different parts of the park digitally updated. I realise perhaps 99.9% of Japanese will check queue information on the app but as a visitor I didn't have this option (no cellphone or app). I felt like i was wasting time (to save time) running back and forth to the information board near the entrance. It was updated with stickers (?) and it was just the one board. Come on Japan, you can get high tech here. It would help. China have got this sorted.

Tomorrowland - Aesthetically it felt like a blue car park. Shibuya is more like the land of tomorrow! Other Disney Parks have much better feeling futuristic areas.

The queues.... they were really bad.

The good - Popcorn flavours - really nice choices. The flowers were all very beautiful. The atmosphere is really good. The natural birds, ducks, cherry blossoms, are very inspiring. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. I liked space mountain too.","Written April 3, 2018",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2053,Fab Feb 14th,"I have never expected to be that good but since I was with the person enthralled with the Disney culture I could not have asked for more.

Emotions aside, the place is vivid and fun. However, there are two advises worth to take note:

1) never enter the Disneyland on any Weekend or national holiday. Even on Thursday, we saw huge crowds. The longest ride to wait for was the Thunder Mountain (even with the fastpass). So, come as early as possible and abuse the fastpass system. Because while you wait for one ride it is possible to try other attractions that do not have fastpasses.

2) I think I just wrote my second one. The fastpass line. Do note, that during one day it is limited to have up to 3-4 passes. However, while spending the whole day take note of which lands have the biggest surpluss of incoming people and what kind of age are they.For example, the Pinocchio and Winnie the Pooh rides are rather crowded during the day because of the sheer number of families. On the other hand, most of them leave after 19-20 hour, thus, freeing the rides up.

It's totally worth every penny. Yes, it's expensive. It is still Disneyland, but the joy was overflowing.","Written April 2, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2054,Disneyland Tokyo 2018,"Disneyland Tokyo was a great experience! It‚Äôs pretty similar to Disneyland in California with fewer rides. The day we went, it was raining and there was still a good amount of people at the park. I wish there were park hopper passes like Disneyland, California. We didn‚Äôt get to experience the Disney Sea side as we were only allowed to purchase one park ticket per day. I heard good things about Disney Sea! Next time I‚Äôm in Tokyo, Disney Sea will definitely be on the list of places to visit. The train system in Tokyo is amazing! It dropped us off right in front of Disney, Tokyo. Wherever you stay in Tokyo, just ask the front desk or use google map and it will direct to on which train to take and transfer to any area in Tokyo! The park ticket was about 70 usd per person and can be purchased at the park entrance.","Written April 1, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

The staff welcome, and the neatness of the place is spectacular.

I thought at the entrance that it was not crowded because basically there was no waiting at the tickets. But the line for many games can stretch for an hour each, which was kind of not what I hoped so. However, Everything else was pleasant.
I recommend it for any family visiting Tokyo but they need to be prepared to wait for long at each game and they should avoid weekends.","Written March 28, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2056,Go for it!,"I‚Äôve wanted to take my Australian children to any of the Disneyland properties anywhere in the world for many years now. So to be here was a dream come true. To finally do this at the Tokyo Disneyland property was probably fortuitous, compared to, say, anecdotes about the American alternative experience. My recent experiences in Japan have all been blessed by the awesome gracious conduct of the Japanese people. So to see groups of young Japanese people really immersing themselves in the flavour of Disneyland, by dressing up accordingly, in pairs or mixed groups, reflecting their favourite Disney character or theme, was just simply charming. The Japanese do naivety so well! Nearly every visitor was thoroughly into their day‚Äôs experience, with their allegiances visibly shown by either their homework preparation or by their worn purchases. So do I really need to mention the ridiculously long queues or the great expense - you probably already know about these. But to share these cons with Japanese people was so much more bearable than it would be anywhere else in the world. Go for it!","Written March 27, 2018",4.0 of 5 bubbles

We recommend either Pirates of a Caribbean or Jungle cruise, less waiting time. This time we tried the Tree House, where located in front of Tiki room. No lines and enjoyed a lot. Just up and down the Tree House, but felt so much nostalgic like been in a childhood again. When you are in Adventure land worth trying. Have a wonderful time there.

We timed it that when we bought the tickets the park opened at 8 and we were able to squeeze in at the front of the crowd.
Today is the first day for the kids in Tokyo spring break so I think every kid was here. Since it‚Äôs easy to get to by the JR train they just hop off and your here.
Everyone runs in and the staff asks them kindly to slow down and walk. That was not happening. Thunder mountain was already a 3 hour line and this place has only been open for 30 min!
Will go on a few rides but no way a 3 hour wait. Even the line for fast pass was an hour. Hey it‚Äôs Disney, you kind of expect it.

It offers most of the tried-and-true favorites our kids love from the States, with a few fresh twists. One of the kids' favorite rides was Pooh's Hunny Hunt -- different than the Pooh rides stateside. While it was freezing during our late January visit, lines were short -- like a slow day in the States at a Disney park -- so I'd recommend wearing a down parka and braving the cold! Food is ""meh"", probably worse than the American parks, but that wasn't a surprise. We thought the flavored popcorn that is so hyped here was mediocre at best. Overall, though, a great experience, and while I would not make a special trip to this park from the US, it was fun to visit since we are living in Asia.

The food selections on offer are a blend of traditional Japanese to familiar Western and prices are generally what you'd expect. Portions are smaller than the US parks though which is worth bearing in mind.

Crowds are the biggest thing which does come to mind with the Tokyo Disney parks however you really have to just go with it. Your inside voice will be saying what the hell, it's a Thursday in February with no school holidays and its raining! The rides and queueing are so efficient that even with insane numbers and Fast Passes running out by 10.30 it will still be a manageable day with a bit of planning. Crowd calendars are really helpful as for a first visit it's definitely preferable to go on a lighter day and there are some good ones out there!

2075,Pick your day carefully,There's lots of information online suggesting when you should and shouldn't go to Tokyo Disney. There's no exact science but make sure you learn from my mistake and avoid local public holidays. Unfortunately we didn't know Monday 12 February was an observed public holiday until it was too late (I usually check but somehow missed this one). We wanted to go to Disney but we only had one day of our holiday left so took a chance. We arrived at about 10:30am and the line to get in was short. Once we were inside though it went downhill from there. The lines to most of the rides was between 60 and 120 minutes. As you're only allowed one Fast Pass ticket at a time the next available slot on Space Mountain we could get was 2pm. Splash Mountain had a 180 minute wait and we were told we couldn't queue (not that we would have for that long). The Big Thunder ride was out of order adding to the length of queues at other rides no doubt. We basically walked around for four hours with a gentle Siberian breeze blowing through whilst avoiding bumping into other people as we pushed through the crowd. I even went on the carousel (20 minute wait) just so I had a sense of getting some value for money (¬•7400 entry fee). We rode Space Mountain once but that proved underwhelming to the point we handed over our other Fast Pass tickets to a couple of poor buggers waiting at the back of the line. As we were leaving people were still flocking in through the gates. I can't imagine how long they'd have to wait for any rides or attractions. I've been to Disney in Paris and Hong Kong as well as Universal Studios in Singapore. The lines were shorter and the rides and attractions were much better at all of them.

Everyone queued with no fuss at all. During the parade shows everyone seated at the front rows, and quietly standing behind the front rows. Totally a culture shock for us.
We loves the shops as well.
The curry rice, we need to queued for 1 hour but it was delicious.
Try the popcorns!
At the end of the shows, the closing time, the over crowded visitors were headed back in order, no fuss. I will definitely going back someday with my family ‚ù§Ô∏è","Written January 2, 2018",5.0 of 5 bubbles

It didn't spoil our day as we worked out the fast pass system and having teenagers skipped some of the younger style rides. We didn't attend any shows as they're all in Japanese, which is fine, but we didn't speak the language and the show attendants told us not to bother which was helpful. The rides are very tame but good fun.

We were there over the Christmas holiday and the park was decorated beautifully! It was very cold, so dress warmly! It really did not affect us until the sun went down. We stayed in a Air B&B that was about 10 minutes from the park by bus. Tokyo has the best transportation options I have ever seen.

2105,Good but not great ...,"As with most theme parks the earlier you get there the less you have to queue (in theory!), getting into the park was the easiest part and the morning parade was awesome but for a Disney attraction with international appeal, I would have expected to find more employees who could at least speak broken English (I don't mean that disrespectfully but there seemed to be very little desire to cater for tourists). We were there all day and into the evening and seen very few characters and when we did see them they were whisked away by staff within minutes which was disappointing. On the flip side, getting food and drinks were easily accessible and not as expensive as I expected which was a nice bonus after spending a small fortune in the many gift shops there. We went with our teenage kids (16 & 18) who were only really interested in the rides so it was a good day out but not a great day ...

The staff are so happy and so helpful, this added to the experience a great amount. The surroundings are so beautiful and the rides are amazing, especially the Winnie The Pooh ride (I never thought I'd say that!).

Whilst I must admit, DisneySea has the edge and provides a truly unbelievable visit, this was my first experience of Disney Japan and it exceeded all of my expectations but miles.

- Big Thunder Mountain

- Splash Mountain

- Gadget Go Coaster

- Space Mountain (some of the turns are quite sharp, thus the ride is not suitable for young children, etc)

- Star Tours

- Monsters Inc

In addition, the salami pizza at TomorrowLand and the beef steak with rice and the herbed chicken chop with rice at the restaurant at the main shopping area were delicious!

The Haunted Mansion turns into the Nightmare Before Christmas which is just incredible. The Country Bear Jamboree does a Christmas show as well. The Christmas parade, Castle show, and nighttime electric parade are not to be missed! If you get the chance to eat at Blue Bayou, DO!

Other amusement park that I had went had shorter lines than this place. We went there when the Christmas deco was up, so some attraction had a Christmas theme i.e The Haunted Mansion. But all were in Japanese so we hardly understand what they were talking about yet we still enjoyed it nonetheless.

Choose your rides wisely as some had shorter line (less than 15 minutes of wait) while the longer line can took up to 60 minutes & over. My kid did enjoyed most of the rides even though some rides were too short (Peter Pan Neverland) than the wait. Food is not much of a problem there as a lot of stalls were selling finger food and sit in restaurants were more than enough. Check the website for which rides took shorter time to queue as it can help you enjoyed more rides. Bring mobile power bank if you love to take pictures. We spend near 10 hours there as we did saw the light show at the Snow White' castle.","Written December 11, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Organised with typical Japanese attention to detail and punctuality, we were not disappointed. We didn‚Äôt bother with any of the rides as the queues were way too long plus there was plenty to see and enjoy anyway. We would recommend choosing a weekday if possible as the crowds tend to be a little less. Also bring your own food and drink as not only are the prices expensive but you might wait 10 minutes and more in the queue, even for a box of popcorn! We noted even the restaurants had a waiting list.

Food in this park is surprisingly good and well price compare to its California and Orlando counterpart. Staffs are very friendly and always happy to help. There is even staff in the ladies toilet to direct us to the cubbies when the queue is long. Everyone line up obediently even when it comes to picture taking.

2128,Pooh Hunny Hunt,"My first time to Tokyo and first time to Disneyland. Due to tight schedule, I only bought the Starlight pass which allowed you to enter the park after 3pm on weekends. Due to the time constraints, we just took our time to soak in the magical atmosphere and just selected a couple of rides to go on.
Since I am big Winnie the Pooh fan, the Pooh Hunny Hunt ride is must plus it came with highly recommended from friends that have been there. It was a 80 minutes wait for the ride but so worth it plus the cool autumn weather helps as it was not too hot.
We manage to ride other rides such as Stitch Explorer which is more for kids and plus it is all in Japanese so difficult for myself which dont know the language. Then we only had the opportunity to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Snow White and of course another spin on the Hunny Hunt

2130,Tokyo Disneyland with a preschooler,"Having done extensive research on TDL, I was a little hesitant at first on bringing our 5yo (so many reports on long queues, running for Fastpasses, etc.).
However, we are really glad we decided to go eventually and even managed to get on many rides with minimal fuss. We decided on getting an After 6 pass plus a full day pass each.
We checked in to Oriental Tokyo Bay Hotel at 3pm and had a nap before taking the Partner hotel free shuttle bus. We skipped the long queues at the ticket counters as we had printed out the tickets at home.
Managed to catch the interactive Stitch 'show' unknowingly - it was in Japanese of course, so we could only get a feel of the atmosphere.
Following that, a quick snack of onigiri (you can actually pack a whole picnic along) before we went to catch the Dream of Lights Parade which was amazing for all of us.
After that we managed several rides at Fantasyland, including the Haunted Mansion and even the Winnie the Pooh ride. This last one was our bonus for that night since we decided to try our luck at 9.50pm and managed to get in within 20 minutes with no Fastpass! (The park closes at 10pm and people were just starting to leave after 10.20pm)
We started the next day slightly later as we had had a late night, at around 10am.
With rain being forecast, the crowds were quite forgiving. We managed to get Fastpasses twice to Space Mountain where my 5yo discovered her love for roller coasters!

My expectation was wrong and I had great day there.
Characters were so real that I could go back to my childhood, felt seeing movies in front of my eyes.
Parade at night was so wonderful because there was already Christmas season.
Lights, music, costumes were attractive enough.
After that I could watch fireworks, quite long and so beautiful, exactly same as intro of Disney movies.
Also I tried some attractions there.
Many attractions might be boring to adults if you expected thrilling experience though you could see cute characters there, well decorated.
There are some thrilling attractions and I Jet coaster and I was soooo fast and fun, must try it.

2137,Crowded and very commercial but nice attractions,"Disneyland Tokyo is rather a big merchandising shop than a theme park. First i was really disappointed because within the first 2 hours i only saw 1 disney figure and of course you have to queue to take a picture. Talking about queuing you have to know that you have to queue everywhere. If you want to ride a roller coaster, you have to queue, if you want to have lunch you have to queue, if you want to buy popcorn you have to queue for at least 30 minutes. Even for the smoking room we had to queue... that was really disgusting.
The only way not to queue for a roller coaster is the fast ticket system. It¬¥s highly recommended that you inform yourself about the fast tickets because it can save you a lot of time. Some of the attractions like the ""Star Tours"" or ""space mountain"" were very nice and we had a lot of fun and also the disney parade was quite impressive and so all in one i dont regret that we went there.","Written November 29, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

The customer service is pretty good I must say and everythi g is clean and orgnaized. It was raining in the morning of our visit and the stopper park areas were not covered. In one instance where it was raining a bit more I came back to my stroller with an open umbrella covering it to help keep the seat dry - such amazing consideration by the cast members.

The staff were friendly and helpful and I guess they are used to the crowds. Visitors were happy to wait in line for the toilets and believe it or not they have staff doing crowd control in the ladies as well. Waiting time for us at the rides like Pirates of the Caribbean 1 hr 15 mins, Splash Mountain 3 hrs 15 mins, All the other rides including Dumbo were over 2 hr wait in the line. When the parades were on people lined up along the route and sat on plastic mats for over 1 hour to sit in front everyone else had to stand at the back. For us average age 60 we were unable to sit on the ground on concrete for over an hour with legs folded. The park was clean and all the parades were colourful, the Christmas theme beautiful. We waited all day for the fireworks to start at 8.30 and at 7.30 it rained so the whole show was cancelled. Luckily all 4 of us that went have been to Disneyland in LA, Hong Kong and Paris. All of these other parks we were able to move around comfortably and have a wonderful time on the rides. If you had never been to a Disney Land you would not be so disappointed. I would not return to this park again unless they put in place a maximum park capacity. Unfortunately once you pay to get in it doesnt matter if you get on the rides or not and at $90 approx a ticket it was not worth the experience.","Written November 17, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

2145,Great park! Lots of fun for everyone!,"I should start by saying we live very close to Disney California and go there regularly. So we are very familiar with the Disneyland experience.
This park was great! Yes it's very busy but if you use the fast passes and hit the smaller rides in between you'll maximize your day! We did almost every ride with-in 8hrs!
Highlight rides:
- Winnie the Pooh's Honey Hunt
-totally different that California Disneys Pooh ride and 100x better.
- Canoe ride
- paddle your way around a river and see animatronic animals and Indians
- Peter Pan (similar to California but better)

Letdown
The only real letdown was the food options. Really not much diversity and not very good. We ended up walking to the Ikspari mall (5min walk) and found a Guzman and Gomez Mexican restaurant that had great food at reasonable prices. There's also a cheap supermarket in the mall for waters and snacks.

2146,Awesome experience,"We are originally from California so we have already visited Disneyland Anaheim (many times), as well as Disneyworld in Florida. I thought this location was way better than the two we have already visited. First, Tokyo Disneyland is very clean and organized. People are very polite and friendly. It was also not overcrowded (when we went anyway). Wait time on rides here in Tokyo ranges from at least 2mins to 45mins max. At other locations, wait time on kiddie rides alone starts around 30mins and above. So pretty much, here in Tokyo Disney, we were able to see and experienced all of the rides within a day. Maybe next time, we will add an extra day just to relax and take it slow. The shows are in Japanese but my 7 year old son enjoyed his time here just as much. The light shows, parade and music are just like any other Disneyland, it's magical! Food and merchandises are a bit expensive but it is what it is. They have a Disney popcorn bucket here that is not available in US. A must have if you are a collector.

I do plan on letting my son visit Disneyland all over the world and so far, I can honestly say that our experience here in Tokyo was more relax due to less crowding. So even if you have been to other Disney location, I do recommend TOKYO Disneyland to be added on your bucket list. You won't regret it!","Written November 16, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We queued to meet Mickey for over an hour and were only allowed to take 1 photo. We stumbled across Peter Pan & Tinkerbell. No other opportunities.

It was a sunny day and the kids enjoyed the place despite the long lines and long wait for their rides. The older ones strolled around the place having photo ops with Disney characters. We all sat on the roadside to watch the afternoon parade and we bought souvenir socks, calendars, key chains and the like in shops.

We waited for the electric parade and fireworks that afternoon but unfortunately it rained. We went home when the announcement came that the electric parade was cancelled due to bad weather. The evening became chilly so the kids decided to go home.

Happiest place to be in for the family but some events were cancelled so we were quite disappointed. Another sad feeling we experienced there were that Stitch's show was in Japanese, we did not understand any of it.

If I want to book a restaurant, I can only book online in Japanese üò°. I only saw 4 characters in the park, and you couldn't take photos with them. There was no place to buy drinks....you had to stand in food queues for nearly an hour just to purchase a water.

The rides are more or less same, except instructions in Japanese, Food are oriental, Japanese and western. Japanese loves wearing disney costume, even teens, it was a sight. Waiting time is longer as many availed of fast lane. There were halloween parade which I missed due to rain. The fireworks was short compare to other Disneylands. The electric parade was cancelled due to the rain, but we stayed on for the fireworks after we found some shade. It was cold but rainy and not that fun due to the weather, but this is disneyland.","Written November 8, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2153,Ok but dated - choose Disney Sea instead,"Visited on a Tuesday in mid-November. Crowd levels were OK, busy but not the huge crowds people have been talking about on here. Most rides were about 60 mins wait.

Overall disappointed with this park. Many things felt very dated and like it needed a rethink. The Western/Adventure theming areas were enjoyable, but the rest of the park was disjointed. Physically huge but with no more to do than Disneyland Paris, so Tokyo feels empty and a little soulless.

Parades and shows were sensational however. Don‚Äôt miss the electrical parade.

There were more things for under 10s and 5s than the whole family.

If you are short for time, just visit Disney Sea instead. It is next door and far superior","Written November 8, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2154,Lovely park but some attractions just don't worth the long wait,"It's my second visit to Tokyo Disneyland, last visit being 10 years ago. Being a Disney fan and frequent visitor of other Disneylands, I must say this visit to Tokyo DL wasn't as magical as it was (I did have high expectation). The park is still lovely and I still enjoy Disneyland. I guess what made it less magical this time were the close down (or late opening) of some major rides, the crowds and the cancellation of fireworks (it's really disappointing when you have stood at the perfect spot for an hour waiting for the fireworks to end the magical day but I know it's all up to the weather). Also, I was quite surprised there were so few live shows, and when there was one, it's in Japanese.

But I have to say, the cast members were wonderful. They were so friendly and helpful, sharing joy with guests, simply can't say anything bad about them. And though I said the crowd made the day less magical, I did enjoy very much watching people dressing up as different Disney characters. It was a delight to see how much effort people put into dressing up!","Written November 6, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

2162,Most magical place on earth (or one of them),"Disneyland is simply magic! That is the best way to describe it, absolute magic!
We bought a 3 day pass for both Disneyland and DisneySea. We loved both of them!

The whole place is absolutely delightful!! All the staff are wonderful, friendly and happy! The rides are lots of fun and there's heaps to do.

The parades are absolute magic! There's a few parades throughout the day and they are all as good as each other. It really is the happiest place on earth!

Seems very obvious but for English speaking tourists, most of the rides and shows are in Japanese so be mindful of that. The performances around the park are in Japanese too and it is beautiful ! The level of talent of all the performers is insane!

Important to get there early in the day and try and get fast passes for the rides. The way the fast passes work: Take your disneyland ticket to the ride you want to go on (choose one with a long wait time that you really want to go on). Go to the fast pass machine located nearby the rides - there should be a clock nearby to tell you what fast pass times they are allocating. Go to a fast pass machine and scan your ticket under it. The machine spits out a little ticket with an hour allocated spot for you to return for the ride. Return to the ride at the allocated time and skip the queue! (you will still have people in the fast pass line with you but not nearly the same as lining up without one). Look on your fast pass ticket for the next time you are able to get a fast pass and make sure to utilize that!!

2165,Magical,"We had a fabulous day at Tokyo Disneyland. This place just oozes happiness. Adults and children alike will absolutely love it here. The queues to get in weren‚Äôt as bad as we‚Äôve experienced in California and the security checks weren‚Äôt as time consuming. All the rides were great; with wait times of varying length. Make sure you organise your day so you can see all the attractions and parades and make wise use of fast passes. We didn‚Äôt think much of the food on offer at Tokyo Disneyland....there weren‚Äôt enough food stalls selling lunch items, but quite a few popcorn stalls. You can refill your novelty bucket with popcorn all day if you want, but you might be waiting in line longer for popcorn than you would for a ride! We ended up booking a restaurant for lunch/dinner at a ridiculous time of 3.30pm but that was the only time available. I‚Äôd advise that if you are wanting to eat something more than popcorn all day, I‚Äôd make time to book a restaurant earlier in your day. The meal we did have in the restaurant was terrific and worth waiting for.","Written October 22, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2166,Awesome,"Luckily we visited in October when everyone is allowed to come in a Disney-themed costume. So many people were dressed up (the best was a mother & father dressed as Burt & Mary Poppins on Jolly Holiday - with their two small children dressed as penguins.) The Japanese love Disney and show it in their attention to detail. Most of the rides are very similar to their American counterparts (Pooh's Honey Hunt is quite different and the best Pooh ride I have ever been on.) The parades are over the top and include a lot of the older Disney characters (one float was dedicated to the Aristocats.) Their Electric Light Parade is so much better than the one that is now in California (coming from Florida); it is almost worth the price of a plane ticket just for that. People are allowed to stakeout a spot and to sit during the parades, so lining up in the back is much better and I was (finally) able to see the entire parade. I found the fireworks to be rather lame, however. The Magic Kingdom's are much bigger and fantastic.","Written October 21, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Rides were about a 20-minute wait, food wasn't long at all, maybe 5 minutes. Except for the turkey leg queue. That was a line that went on for about 100 meters and they only sell turkey leg. We waited for 20 minutes and enjoyed our turkey!

2172,The happiest place ever.,"Tokyo Disneyland is always fun on every visit.

Tips would be to buy your tickets in advance (e.g. Disney hotels, online, or Disney store at Shibuya sells tics too).

Go early at opening 8am to get on the best rides (e.g. space mountain, splash mountain, big thunder mountain) and also make sure you get your fast passes once you reach. There are also fast passes and long queues for certain kids rides like winnie the pooh.

Go back for the night shows, the night electric lights parade starts at 730pm, fireworks 830pm and night show 850pm. It is always packed but you should be able to get a spot where it is all viewable. You are allowed to leave the park and go back later in case you need to go back to the hotel for a rest.

Maihama is only about 20mins from Tokyo station though the walk within Tokyo station to get to the line is pretty far. So about 30mins travel time.","Written October 19, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Also - if you're in two minds about whether to stay at the hotel, do it, you can get in 15 mins early to the park, which means you are at an advantage for the fast passes all day long, it makes the day much better.","Written October 16, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We went straight to Pooh's Hunny Hunt when the park opened and only waited about 20 mins to ride it as opposed to 2 hrs during peak times. I would recommend getting a Fast pass as soon as you arrive as the times fill up very quickly. My favourite ride was Splash Mountain! We didn't have a Fast Pass for that but only waited an hour so it wasn't bad at all. My least favourite ride was Peter Pan's Flight; it was very short and the track was jerky.

The food at Disney is great. I tried the milk chocolate popcorn which was absolutely delicious. Curry popcorn was OK. I loved the Halloween special churro which was maple pumpkin flavour and also enjoyed the new Star Wars mochi! We ate lunch at Tomorrowland Terrace which was reasonably priced and filling.

I think Tokyo Disneyland is unique for the guests that dress up in fantastic themed costumes and groups of friends and families who coordinate their outfits. It was really cute to see.

2178,Arm yourself with Fastpass,"Seriously, do not go without a Fastpass if you plan on doing more than 1-2 rides in one day. Not only that, some rides they simply close to general population (that is, without Fastpass), so even if you want to wait 2 hours in the line, you can not. Apart from that, its a fun park, with pro's and con's in comparision to elsewhere in the world. But then again, you are in Tokyo and not Paris, and comparing those is pointless.

Food was average.

Use the Fastpass - it took us a day to get the hang of it. Grab one (if he queue isn't longer than going on the ride itself - which sometimes you see). Then when grab the NEXT as soon as the time allows (it's printed on your Fastpass) then go on the ride for the first Fastpass.

There are rides and activities for all ages. To get the most out of the rides, you need to be over 102cm.

Make sure you get there at least half an hour before opening time and pre- purchase tickets online. Make sure you know which rides are a must and go directly to them when the park opens. Otherwise you may miss out or find yourself in a queue of over an hour.

They have a fast pass system that I would read up on before you go as it seems to change regularly (based on what people who had been before have told me).

There was plenty of food on offer with some particularly interesting popcorn flavours including curry!

The nighttime parade was fantastic and a must see. The floats were incredible!

For people with young kids, you can hire a stroller for 100 Yen (about $11 Australian). I would recommend you do as there is a lot of walking to be done.

We were lucky enough to attend at the time of year when public are allowed to dress up as characters and well this just made the whole day even more magical. Some were dressed even better than the real characters.

The parades were the best we have ever seen and again so well organised. Everyone is made to take a spot, but no one can stand up in front of someone, you can't block people's views, you can't overcrowd an area, it was just magical and the organisation made the whole event better.

For any Disney fan this place is a must, the merchandise alone makes it worth to visit. There is something unique in almost half the shops so if you love souvenir shopping then this is ideal, but do it early, there will be frenzied biscuit buying at the end of the day.
I've noted a few times in reviews that people complain about the lack of English and difficulty in communicating. However I found that we had no problems at all, there are pictures to point at and you/cast members usually get the gist of the conversation.

This place is amazing and if you have never been to disney and worry that your too old to enjoy it, please don't, you will have the best day. This place is massive! and even in winter we found that the wait time was around 30min to an hour, so the fast passes can be worth it. There are many different sections to the park each with there own theme, music and foods!.The light shows at the end are beautiful and worth staying for. The food within the park is average.","Written September 19, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2201,Great day out,"If you haven't been to Disneyland you must go. The place is amazing, beautifully designed and extremely well laid out. The park is clean the staff are friendly and helpful and all of the attractions are great fun. It's great value and you can easily spend the entire day as there is so much to see and do. The only downside for me was the length of the queues, when we visited they were up to 2 hours by the end of the day. You can get a fast pass for some rides every two hours so get there early to make the most of this system.","Written September 18, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2202,Finally visited Tokyo Disney,"Tokyo Disneyland in my honest opinion is a bit old..you can see it in the looks of some of the rides and unfortunately a few of the rides were also closed for renovation at the time of my visit, not to mention the scorching hot summer weather and oh so crowded visitors everywhere with long queues in almost every ride, together with unusual (at least for me) lottery system to get a ticket for the musical show. It all made my visit somehow less impressive than what I had previously expected.
But after all it is still Disneyland, and you can't help feeling happy and amazed going there. Star Wars 4d ride there was great and they did great job with the parades (I watched all 3 parades of the day:Tanabata parade, mid-Day Parade, Night Lights Parade).
They have a few restaurants with different themes, as well as snacks stall with yummy popcorn and ice cream too..
Oh and the Cinderella grand castle is indeed majestic and magnificent, the way it was lit up at night time along with projection fireworks show is also something you should not miss!
All in all still a great day out at Disneyland Tokyo, but for more sophisticated rides, less tiring walk around the theme park, shorter queue time for each rides, and easy access to the musical shows, you might as well consider going to Hongkong Disneyland.","Written September 17, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

2209,Happiest place on (Japanese) earth!,"The Disney magic works just about anywhere. It's about 45 minutes by subway from the Shinjuku station to the Maihama station. We went on a weekday and the place is packed. If you're short on time, you can get an After 6 pass for 4200 yen (1 Day pass is 7400 yen). The Japanese really get into the Disney spirit. You can see groups of people wearing matching Disney and non-Disney attires, including kimonos. There is a little bit of language barrier. It's weird to hear Mickey and the other characters speaking Japanese, but still entertaining though. I give it a 4.5/5 because the evening fireworks were canceled on the day we went.","Written August 28, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

They are very kind and try their best to accommodate for everyone of different age, size and race. The light show at the end has got to be one of the best parts of the day by far. I would highly recommend staying until the show starts.

The only downfall to the experience would be the extremely long queues. My sister, my boyfriend and myself waited in line for Big Thunder Mountain for two hours and it we were all uncomfortable due to the heat.

They also had a ride from Pinocchio and the old Snow White adventure ride. We had heard the Winnie the Pooh ride was worth riding even if you were an adult and we were so happy we rode it.

Looking at the overall picture is amazing, but we found that looking at the details makes for a much more enchanting experience. Added to that, there were so many groups of people who dressed up in costumes or matching outfits for the day! Food wasn't too expensive, gifts were priced about where we expected.

We we're disappointed with the characters hardly any and when you did see them they weren't interested in having photos with you almost ignored you if you were an adult the merchandise not even one Tshirt with 2017 on it actually almost nothing with 2017 lots of tin sweets and cookies

2228,Wonderful Theme Park,"This is a great theme park and one of if not the best Disney ""castle"" parks in the world. Well run, clean, and wonderfully themed. Pales a bit in comparison to its neighbor DisneySea, but great if you have a small kids. The cast members are enthusiastic and friendly and go out of their way to help even when there's a language barrier. It was very easy to get in the park (very efficient security and ticket checks) and the price is very reasonable especially in comparison to US parks.

The food is fantastic. Loved the chocolate and caramel popcorns and came home with an awesome BB8 popcorn holder. The chicken waffle sandwiches are fantastic - you get those at Camp Woodchuck. Lots of funky snacks and things that are worth trying.

We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and got the Happy 15 early entry which enabled us to ride a couple extra things during the day. Very worth it. The parades especially the electric parade are great.

The rides are the usual Disney assortment with a few unique ones thrown in. Pooh's Honey Hunt was great but was broken a lot of the day so we could only ride it once. Monsters Inc we found to be overrated, really nothing special. But the usual rides like Haunted Mansion, Pirates, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder, etc, were all wonderfully themed and fun. Lines were manageable in the middle of the week but fast passes helped a lot. Very sadly both Space Mountain and Small World were closed during our visit. Boo. Also the fireworks were cancelled when we were there due to ""high winds"" but the winds were pretty light. Disappointing.

Trick bring your own food and water for at least half a day. If you r visiting Muslim family try to bring your own food for whole day. It gets very crowded and waiting time for rides can be as long as 70mins or more. Try to check online before you go to choose appropriate day by looking at crowd calendar anything under 50 should be good. Try to choose your rides if you are specific about them.

The access through rail system is easy. Disneyland is easily navigable. There are staff planted everywhere to help you. Tomorrowland is amazing.

What's not good

Too many shops make it feel like a mall. There are few rides which are clearly for children below 5. Need to put some rating. Built in 1983, the park does seem old and little out of date but then it's Disneyland.

What to do

Try the roller coasters which are really fun. Tomorrowland has a Star War 3D tour which is amazing. Splash Mountain had a long queue but was fun.","Written June 22, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2245,"Exhorbitant Charges, Trying Experience - If You Can't Communicate in Japanese","The visuals attract. The fairytale castle, the quaint period buildings housing shops and diners, the costumed crew, the themed coaches, the delightful Parades, the unique rides.

In general, the hardware pleases.

The software - the human touch, failed miserably. I felt this. My take is that Tokyo Disneyland is meant for Jap speakers specifically.

There was an obvious lack of roving Disney characters for photo ops. My entire day there only sighted Goofy & Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. Both acts were chaperoned by crew members who, without exception, set up photo ops for Jap speaking visitors.

I needed paracetamol tablets. I approached 5 crew members gathered at the water cooler shed, next to the First Aid cross signage. I showed them the box I had bought in Tokyo. They chorused "" Sorry"" with clenched fisted arms crossed ""x"" before their chests. I pointed to my head, said ""pain"", and pointed to the First Aid cross signage. All I got were crossed arms, although with beaming smiles - which I registered as fake.

I rested at the same shed. Near Parade time, the crew chased me out. No one was allowed in the shed except those who need to drink water from the cooler .. and then go. I complied, hobbling on my walking stick to stand behind the shed, in the hot sun.

Just before the Parade started, the rope barrier was released and a group of Japanese visitors were allowed to sit where I was chased away. Not good.

I asked how long to queue to do the Pirates of the Carribean ride. 20 minutes, I was told. And how long will the ride take? 20 minutes. I was told again. I don't think they understood me.

After queuing for 30 mins, I was ready to board the boat. I signaled to the crew manning the admission that I was travelling alone, with my walking stick. She waved me on to queue no 4. I struggled onto the boat. No help was offered or rendered.

Having settled in, 2 crew members came and gestured me to move to the boat at the back. There was no finesse or politeness in their communication. I lifted my walking stick to show them moving is an issue for me.

Regardless, they continued their Japanese jabbering. Embarrassed and upset, I struggled out of the boat. Again, no help was offered or rendered. The crew didnt bother to help me to the alternate boat. When I left the ride area, none the crew cared. The smiles weren't there anymore. Also, no smiles showed on me. For Sure! Yes, I forgo the ride after the lengthy queuing. There was definitely no Disney mood to be had.

Look closely at some pics I have attached. Benches meant for 5 to 6 to sit were occupied by lesser numbers... with bags etc taking up the empty spaces. Crew members aren't monitoring this enough. In the heat of the day, there is no shaded area set up for the infirm, the very old or very young.

My experience is that Disneyland Tokyo need to be more humane. I am wishing upon a star for that to happen.","Written June 22, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

After months of preparation we were finally here and it even more amazing than we could ever imagine. Since we arrived in Tokyo Disneyland during their Easter Time, we had fun finding those cute eggs around the park and also laughing at Usatama naughtiness (their egg bunny character made especially for this year easter). the most memorable ride for my kiddos are the Pooh Hunt and We managed to get Pooh Hunt Rides 2 times. One with the Fast Pass. Also got to ride Monster's Inc 2 times. We enjoyed our dinner at Queen of Hearts and Grandma's Sara. and dont forget to mention all those popcorn and the cuteness of popcorn buckets. i managed to grab 3 buckets to bring home hehehe...

Fast Pass is good idea to tried on to skip the long line.

2258,Fun theme park but a little disappointed,"This is my first time visited Tokyo Disneyland. Quite crowded and the queue line is long enough. Every restaurant is full, we need to wait at least 2 hour to get a table. But the attraction is so attractive and fun, and the souvenir was really cute. But for any traveler who visited this park, we need to pay attention to our belongings. Because if we want to enjoy an attraction or eat in the restaurant we need to parking our stroller out side, at first I tough it was amazing that everyone let their belongings stay in their stroller while they enjoying the attraction. So it means this themed park is safe from any lost or thief. But something bad happened to us, we lost our ergo baby carrier that we put in our stroller outside the restaurant, even though there is a waitress standing and waving for new customer near the stroller parking. But they can't say nothing about our complaint that we lost our stuff. Poor us. After eat we enter an attraction then parking out stroller ""again"" then ""again"" we lost our thing. This time is my daughter balloon. ‚òπÔ∏è so for any traveller, kept your belongings save by put your important things on your bag and carry them every where you go.","Written May 18, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles

If you have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and Hongkong, it will seem familiar yet interestingly different at the same time. The crowds can get big but waiting for rides will be worth it. I love their special popcorn buckets and browsing through their shops with interesting stuff can easily take much of your time.

2270,Very charming but needs more thrills,"I went to Disneyland in October 2013 with my friends and I enjoyed my time there. The staff at both Disneyland and Disneysea are probably the nicest and most polite you will ever meet in a theme park which is very common in Japan. The ride I was looking forward to the most was the Winnie the Pooh's ride which was closed for maintenance. The Flume ride and the ghost mansion were amazing; however, the grizzly mountain roller coaster and the space mountain were a bit lackluster compared to their counterparts in Hong Kong Disneyland and they needed more thrills added into them. Overall, it was an amazing experience but if you are out of time and can only visit one of Tokyo's Disney Parks, go for Disneysea. Also, plan well and go EARLY!!!!","Written May 3, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2271,A must do!,"Coming to Tokyo Disneyland is one of the highlight of my JAPAN trip. This is the first Disneyland I have visited and yes, long queue for each attraction. But surprisingly as an impatient person, I was able to patiently wait for around an hour for a ride. I read a lot about fastpass before my visit but as I arrive at 12pm, I did not manage to get any. Well it's not the end of the world though! In fact I find the rides I done was far from memorable as the daytime parade, electric parade, firework and Cinderella castle light show. Dining at the queens banquet was amazing too and we managed to avoid the crowd by having dinner at 4.30pm. The queue was twice as long when we left! Winnie the Pooh ride was a WOW ending to my visit (the queue was still long even at 9pm) as it really amazed me how they designed the routes for the electric cars.

2272,Another day at Disneyland.,"Tokyo Disneyland is a 5 mins walk from the Maihama train station. There are numerous rides here with the better rides being those with the Fastpass. The better few attractions in my opinion are the Winnie the Pooh, haunted mansion (cool computer graphics and lightings) and the Buzz lightyear. Food option were nothing spectacular, and the queues were all very long. Plan things to do while waiting in line for your turn.","Written May 1, 2017",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2273,Crowded and a tad disappointing,"It is necessary to arrive early and line up in order to beat the crowds. Having visited Disneyland in both the US and Hong Kong, I found Tokyo Disneyland to be much the muchness. Lines for rides were ridiculous with wait times up to two hours, so a fast pass is a must. The most intriguing part of the visit was observing the Disney outfits worn by visitors to the park. Bought the three day pass but only spent one day here. Tip: it is cheaper to purchase from the Disney shop at Maihama Station than to purchase in the park.","Written May 1, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Suggest that one should go and take fast pass on the post famous rides as they are marked on the map. Remember to carry a jacket for sure and don't wear summer clothes as it gets really windy there and a jacket and jeans is must.

Loved it but had to have lots of patience to wait to get on the rides.","Written May 1, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2275,Full of originality but remain traditional Disney theme,"Its fun, signature parade in Spring was Easter parade- funny enough, it sounded like performing till mid June. I assume people don't know much about Easter concept. Anyway, the on-going parade was all about bunnies and eggs called Usatama. The story was the bunny like eggs, Usatama were running away, Mickey and friends were trying to capture them. The parade song was half Japanese and half English. Costume, dance and parade itself was full of originality and very interesting that visitors could enjoy the uniqueness of Tokyo Disney Land.
However, most of the attraction was solely operated in Japanese. I personally wondered if they should hire more casts who can speak multiple languages or install some subtitle board displayed English and more languages electronically for non Japanese speakers at each ride or show.
Other than language barrier, they have offered unique food, interesting snack and fun and collectible souvenirs that we can't find in the US.","Written April 30, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2276,Great Disney experience,"This was my first trip to a disneyland and the size and scale of ecerything took some getting used to. Huge amount of people but in true Japanese style, its ordered chaos and you dont feel over crowded and everyone is respectful.
The park is huge and we didnt really understand the fast pass system at first but went in an anticlockwise direction from opening and we seemed to walk into each attraction with minimal wait times. I enjoyed the ""Star Tours"" attraction the most as we didnt know what we walked into and although it was all in Japanese it was still fun. Not sure what the hype is about the Winnie the Pooh ride is as it was the most boring for us, over all the rides here are not thrill rides.
The fast passes have an hour or so wait time on them, so once you get one for a ride you cant grab one for a different ride straight away. We also didnt realise the lines at the front gate were to get in, not actually purchase the tickets, so if you are buying at the park, look for the ticket booths (in between the massive lines waiting to get in).

Other than that, explore the park and enjoy the night light parade, its amazing.","Written April 30, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2277,Great nostalgia hit and beautiful Nighttime parade,"First time to Disneyland and it was a long but worthwhile day. I went as an adult with a group of adult friends, but we all enjoyed reliving our childhood and having fun. Food was more reasonably priced than I expected too! If you can make it out the whole day, DEFINITELY stay for the final electric parade. The floats are incredible!

Unfortunately, some rides were also closed during April 2017. Check online before planning the trip. We were a little disappointed by this.

I took as much advice from online as possible:
- go early
- go on a weekday
- try not to catch school holidays

It turned out wise to follow this advice. Still, by lunch time you should be expecting to wait in lines for a while.

If you are going with your friends as an adult, realise that the rides aren't going to blow you away. The best picks when we went were Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and Astro Blasters.","Written April 29, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Many of the rides were suitable for children and the clear focus is on child rides. Some of the rides we went on had no english. This is understandable and expected, however it would be good if this was made clear before going into the ride/show. We still enjoyed the shows and had a great day.

Afterwards we went on to try all the rides (unfortunately Space Mountain was closed for repairs), but Star Tours had been updated since last time I visited Disneyland in Paris, so we tried it 7 times in a row... that's how great it was. All the rides were just pure fun, just as we're used to and we just continued until late evening until we had to leave. The different restaurants around the park are also very nice, although they could be a little crowded, but what else could one expect?!

In the evening before leaving the park we went shopping for all kinds of Disney-stuff and to top off an excellent day we enjoyed the incredibly beautiful evening parade.

Planning the rides with fast pass was another good strategy, with that we managed to take most of the rides within one day visit. Our kids really enjoy the rides and all the performances which we can always feel their passion. The friendly park assistants were always around with smiling face to guide and assist.

2306,Another Great Disney Experience,"I will preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Disney. Being from the United States, I went to Walt Disney World in Orlando quite a few times throughout my life, and have probably experienced it from all perspectives (as an awe-struck 6 year old, as a ""too cool for school 13 year old, as an 18 year old interested in the business side of it, and as a 20 year old with my girlfriend at Disneyland Paris). This trip to Disney Tokyo was everything I could have hoped for. Now, after having been to Disneyland Paris I knew that all of the other Disneyland's don't compare to that of Disney World, so I had a good mindset going in. The park is small enough to do in 1 maybe 2 days, and wouldn't recommend any more time than that. Its just classic disney with all of the classic characters and rides. And its kind of cool to hear Buzz Lightyear speak Japanese while waiting inline for ""his ride"". Only negative experience that I had with the whole thing was really a minor thing. I am a 6 foot 3, in shape (not fat) 21 year old American, and am definitely the minority in Asia in terms of body size. My friend and I wanted to ride in the front car in Space Mountain but I was too big and didn't fit because my legs were too long. Even in one of the bigger carts in the back it was a very tight squeeze and was barely able to fit in the cart. I have never had that problem back home at any amusement park, especially not at Disney. But I understand that I am definitely not the typical customer that they get, so I don't really have a problem with it.","Written April 5, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

What we need to do is grab the fast pass during diapensing time by scanning the barcode at our tickets and come during the specified timing. So that we can enjoy more attraction and rides. The Attractions and rides very suitable for kids. So far only one attraction which is stich interaction which is done in japanese and we can't understand a single words.

There are plenty snacks available in the park such as popcorn, turkey leg, churos, ice cream but most of the stalls have quite long queue. Food served at the stall also quite nice and reasonably priced. We did not go to more fancy restaurant.","Written March 17, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

2332,Food,"It's a magical place.

Yes, it is expensive.

Yet, there are ways to save money once you have entered.

A big way to save money is on food.

The queue to buy even a hamburger is as long as it is to take a ride (pardon the pun).

I have had to wait for up to an hour (pardon the pun, again).

And, that hamburger will cost you in not only money, but also in patience.

Add a hungry young child into the equation, the Magic of Disney can become the Tragic of Disney.

So, how to save money on food and avoid any bitter memories you will try to overpaint with ""But, Splash Mountain was all the worth for it 'though, wasn't it?""

The answer...

Bring your own food.
Disneyland has a policy.
You can not bring in any food.
From a business point, this is great.
From a human point, this is not great.
Please follow...

1. There is a 'security check' before entry.
2. The 'checkers' are part-time.
3. The 'checkers' are part-time students.
4. They will check inside your bag.
5. Are they looking for W.O.M.D.?
6. No. They are looking for food.
7. Fast Forward...
8. I'll raise you by two rice balls & a banana.

It's true. Under the guise of security, they are looking for food.

Yet, they can not check your person.

So, two rice balls and a banana can go in your pockets.

They will only be able to ask ""Are you happy to see me? Or do you have...?""

Food easy to find, no waiting, delicious. We had to wait for some rides, but waiting areas were shaded and air-conditioned, so it was not too bad.

2341,So much fun even for adults!,"We stayed onsite at one of the Disney hotels, which allowed us early entry into the park. This definitely came in handy, as it allowed us to secure a fastpass for Pooh's hunny hunt straight away. My advice would be, have a strategy for getting your fast passes and prioritise what rides you want to do. If you're only visiting for the day, this is the best way to see and do as many things as possible. If you come into the park without a plan, you will most likely be waiting in queues for most of the day.

TIP- During parades, the lines get quieter, so this is a good time to try and get on rides.

A lot of the seasonal entertainment will be mainly aimed at Japanese guests, but the Night parade is absolute MUST.

If you have more than one day, it will be easier to just look around without having to race to each ride. In general, I would plan on staying for the entire duration that the park is open, i.e.- 8:30am-10pm. It is a tiring day, but you can always stop for a rest and snack throughout the day.

2357,Worth trying if you haven't experienced Disneyland before.,"Being from Australia I had never been to a Disneyland before, so during my trip to Japan it was the perfect opportunity to experience one for myself.

The scenery and gardens in this place were very impressive indeed. It was worth just spending a bit of time just to walk around and experience the level of detail that had gone into crafting the environment.

Probably the only negative I really have of this place is all the lines and crowds that you have to contend with. If you want to try out some of the popular rides and avoid lining up for hours to do so they have a ticketing system available that you can ""pre-order"" your place in the line with.

You will have to book these tickets in early as they will book out before long, but once you have these tickets you get given a time to come back to the rides, upon which you will pretty much get to the front of the queue straight away. Wish I had known this before coming as it would have been awesome to book our places in the queue while then having time to go and explore the park more.

Anyway to get back to a positive again, pretty much all the food in this park is awesome. If you see any food vendors scattered about and want to try things out I highly recommend it. Unlike from what I hear about the American Disneylands the food here was also quite reasonably priced and was usually Disney themed in some way.

Anyway I definitely recommend going here at least once. Just make sure you learn from my mistake and book your ride tickets early to avoid all the queuing up and you will maximise your experience.","Written January 18, 2017",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Having been to Universal Studios, I'm pleasantly surprised that Disneyland provides complementary ""fast pass"". If you made use of the fast pass, you will definitely be able to complete all the rides within a day! I got a fast pass for the Monster Inc ride first thing I got into the park and proceeded to queue for the rest. You can get your next fast pass in 2 hours or until the timing of the first pass is over.

I love the vibe at Disneyland as everything is simply so magical! And the food at the restaurants actually taste decent! Every corner is a surprise! So go there and let the kid in you be release and enjoy yourself!","Written January 4, 2017",5.0 of 5 bubbles

On the other side, I think it is so small with limited highlighted rides. That makes the waiting time unbearable 90+ minutes. You should go prepared that you won't be able to go to all the rides in one day. Simply because there is too much people for every ride.

2389,Two Days Of Fun In Disneyland,"We bought 2-day tickets to Disneyland for weekdays 30th Nov and 1st Dec. Please check the theme park opening hours before purchasing. On 2nd Dec, Friday, the park closed at 6pm instead of usual 10pm!

Tips - Plan for weekday trips, buy tickets online and you must print out them out, go for fastpass machines first to get fastpass tickets, bring a floor mat if you intend to sit down & watch the parade

Nearest station is Maihama. After exit from station (south exit I think), turn right to Disneyland (turn left to Disneysea). Take a brief 7 mins walk (no covered shelter) to the Disneyland checkpoint (where they check your bags). Along the way, you will pass by a huge Disney store in case you miss out any souvenirs.

Remember to grab the theme park map and show attraction timing (same booklet) after you enter the attraction gates (after scanning the park tickets). The booklets are located on top of the exit/entry gates and it comes with Japanese/English/Chinese.

All show attractions are spoken in Japanese, but will include a few English conversations/songs. Probably due to Christmas season, they sold Turkey drumsticks as snacks along the street. Besides attractions, you can go for side adventure, popcorn hunting. There are six different types of popcorn over the theme park; Soy Sauce & Butter, Caramel, Curry, Salted, Milk Chocolate and Honey. Or you can go on medallion coins hunt. These medallion machines are located in restaurants and souvenir shops and they change the pictures of these medallions (¬•100) everyday.

Getting FastPasses ASAP is essential for the big rides. However when you have 1, you have to wait 3 hours to use it and wait 2 hours before you can get another fast pass.

I have some advise to entry this park

1. Check the weather condition for your planning time. Avoid rainy time or bring rain coat or umvrella

2. Check the show and attraction schedule because sometime they have regurarly maitenance activity. Daily open time are different for every season

3. Entry the park in the morning and back home 10minutes before last show to avoid long Q for train or taxi if use public transportation

4. Get the map and show shedule to make the itinerary plan

5. Get lottery and fastpass as much as you xan to save your time and avoid long Q

6. Make restaurant reservation or take your lunch/dinner before/after lunch/dinner time to avoid long Q and limitation seat

i hv experience when joint at Polynesian terrace. There is Mickey Mouse show when we take our dinner for 1hour offer there. The price quite expensive but if compare with the show i think the price is fair....

2394,Best Disneyland park in Asia,"Why the best:
- The orderliness of the queues. If you have been to the one in Hong Kong where grown-up men and women cut the queue for Flying Dumbo, you will love Disney Japan.

- Very helpful Disney staff. For reviewers who encountered bad attitude from some, please do not assume all are Japanese. Even name tags can be deceiving. Besides, these reviewers should visit the parks in LA and Orlando to truly appreciate the staff in Tokyo.

- Very clean and well maintained grounds and toilets, despite the crowds.

- The dress-up and ambience: The Japs really kit up in Disney gear when they visit, grown-ups, teenagers alike. It really adds to the atmosphere.

All other rides had a varying wait time from 15 minutes to over 2 hours. After getting some food, watching the day and night parade, we probably ride a total of 5 rides in 12 hours.

Still a lot of fun, but it was definitely crowded.

(And if you're going to go to a foreign theme park, don't be the stubborn foreigner and demand your native language or bring a credit card. Provide cash and at least learn some basic phrases, like ""please"", ""thank you"", and ""excuse me"". There were a lot of foreigners there that were the stereotypical ""I'm a foreigner, adapt for me!

We did many research and we found we should go to Tokyo Disney Resort which is a wonderful place. In Tokyo Disney Resort, there are two different style which are Disneyland (for children), and Disney Sea. However, we decided to go to Tokyo Disneyland. It is because Disneyland is more cartoon characters, and we can take photos with them. When I arrived, I saw very beautiful landscape and buildings. The first thing we should do of course is took lots of photos and selfies. When we went in, we saw lots of cartoon characters such as Mickey, Winnie-the-pooh, Donald Duck, and Stitch etc. They are very lovely. At the beginning, I am afraid I will feel boring because Disneyland is for children. And now, I have never regretted we chose Disneyland. After we finished taking photos, we played most of games. Moreover, I recommend five attraction games below:
1. Big Thunder Mountain: is a roller coaster.
2. It's A Small World: you can see traditional costumes of different countries.
3. Dumbo The Flying Elephant: you can control it going up or going down just as flying in the sky.
4. Space Mountain: is a roller coaster.
5. Grand Circuit Raceway: I am a racer when you are playing.

However, I like Space Mountain the most, and it is very thrilling and deserved to try. Because of calling Space Mountain, you play it in dark houses a space station. It will make you feel exciting and amazing during playing this roller coaster.

We tried the much hyped turkey leg which was good but very very very filling (was trying to figure out where all the turkeys came from given how popular it was).

Our tour company gave us the option of coming back at 6 pm or 9pm. I didn't respond in a timely fashion via email so they chose 9pm. No biggie. We got there at around 1145am. We started walking around and looking at the attractions. Then decided that we should call the tour company and arrange a 6pm pick up time. They were more than accommodating.

There was nothing special about the evening fireworks display, but the song that they played was nice.

They have very ridiculous rules like that you cant stand up when taking pictures during the parades. Of course each attraction park needs some rule but here they will not let you be free person and breathe and enjoy your time in the park. You must follow as a sheep, they will immediately punish you if you even put your arm up or stand little bit different way in the line for attraction etc. Totally ruin your experience. There are not much characters that your child can meet. When you spend over an hour in line to take pictures with Mickey Mouse and refuse to buy a picture from them they will only let you take 1picture with Mickey by your own camera! If you ask for one more they refuse and take the character away so you cant take any more pics....etc.etc. For me it was waste of money.","Written October 8, 2016",2.0 of 5 bubbles

I love that all the ride attendants were extremely efficient getting people on and off the rides to ensure shorter ride wait times. I love that during the parades there were more people sitting rather than standing along the parade routes. The only negative for us was that the Indiana Jones ride is located in Tokyo DisneySea.

What we experienced was a wonderful few days that bin my opinion beats hands down the Disneyland in L.A. and is more like the Disneyworld experience in Florida USA. The first thing you need to appreciate is that it is two theme parks in one. Disneyland and Disney Sea. You need more than one day at each part of the resort. We spent 4 days here all up and could easily have spent an extra day here.

We came here with two children aged 7 and 9 and they wanted to see everything and go on every ride which is absolutely not possible in just a few days.

I would definitely recommend this place to all visitors and not just the local Japanese tourists.","Written October 6, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

From queuing for rides, ordering in restaurants and preparing for the parades. We visited with two under fives and they loved the experience. However, note that some fairly innocuous rides inexplicably have some scary moments. Even the wild west train ride suddenly plunges into darkness and passes by fighting dinosaurs which shocked and scared our kids. Don‚Äôt miss the noon time parade. Food is reasonably priced given the location. Access is easy from the city via train. Water fountains abundant throughout the park so just bring a refillable bottle.

My teenagers were enjoy to see some rides, such as space mountain & star wars. Also enjoy to buy Disney souvenirs.

This kind of adds to the atmosphere and makes the day a little more special. We enjoyed the Pirates of the Caribbean the most, but all the river cruises are worth a look. I was happy with the crowds, on a Saturday and I expected it to be busier than it was. Typically 45-60 minute waits for rides, but some down to around 20.

2462,Worse theme park experience...,"To begin with, I always write reviews in tripadvisor to share the experience for travel‚Ä¶ Mostly good reviews as I always manage my own expectations‚Ä¶

I'm giving a 3 out of 5 because there's still many other staff whom were helpful and nice.

I'm had been to theme parks in some countries and I'm not new to Japan or the theme park... It's my 3rd time to the theme park‚Ä¶

I've never felt so offended in a Theme Park or in Japan!
My visit to the Disneyland Tokyo last Friday was the most terrible encounter apart from the usual theme park issues such as long queue and announcement from Staff are always in Japanese... for some rides, there's pre-recorded English announcements... but not for Meet & Greet... However, the staff will try their best to communicate nicely with their limited English.
We went to queue at the Meet & Greet at Mickey's House...
Every Meet & Greet I went I noticed that the Locals are allow to take a photo of just the Character using their own camera.
So, I requested to do the same as the set/background was beautiful and not wanting to jam the queue, I just wanted to do a quick snap n go...
The staff got very angry ( from her body language ), she stretched out her hand in front of my mobile phone, seems like trying to cover or snatch my phone. Then she started saying ""No, no, no, no..."" (4 ""No"")....
Thinking that it could be that her capabilities in English is limited, I tried to explain just Mickey that I'm taking. She continued her ""No, No, No,..."" (Now louder and angrier in her tone)
So my sister tried to explain to her and says that because we always see people allowed to take.

Guess what?

Her reply was ‚Äú with their camera ‚Äú and started using her fingers to point‚Ä¶

More importantly, we were just trying to reason things out nicely with her‚Ä¶ yet, we got reply from her in a louder and rude tone plus body language.

She was so RUDE that she spoilt my happy mood on a theme park day and her colleague whom was holding the SLR camera for taking the official photo has to apologize to us.

Yet there is no apology from the rude staff whom was rude.

As there's no point talking sense to unreasonable person, hence we walked away.

I'm so disappointed and offended by her behavior.

However, it feels as though the treatment towards local and non Japanese speaking tourist is different!

Indeed, it could be a one off incident when we are pure unlucky to meet a no manners person during our trip.

It's a birthday trip for my sister, our intention was to stayed in the theme park for the whole day but the mood was spoilt. Instead of staying a full day, we hanged around for a little longer buying souvenirs then we left.

From this experience, I'm not going back to Disneyland Tokyo.","Written September 4, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles

Make sure u wear matching stuff or have anything that is matching with theme. Japanese are very serious about disney you will see every one in nice theme t-shirts or dress and couple dresses.

Staff were very friendly and courteous and made a great effort to communicate despite our lack of Japanese and their lack of Korean/English. The park is very very very clean and well organized, and it was easy to get around the park. The only problem we faced was that they seem to make it almost impossible to book a meal reservation at a Disney restaurant if you are a foreigner living outside of Japan.

My 5yo had a brilliant time here as did my wife and I!
We found the wait for rides not particularly long (never more than half an hour) and were never frustrated with the crowds. However, it probably really helps to go on a weekday outside of school holidays which we did.
Rides and service at the park were amazing. Food was ok and probably better than the theme park average but still not outstanding. We ate at several different places.
We only did one day and can see why people choose to stay at the park and visit multiple days - there is so much to do and one day simply isn't enough. In hindsight I would have booked a hotel at the park or in the bay area for a few nights and then gone to Tokyo after that. It would save the travel time and cost and allow you to get the most out of an amazing theme park!
Note that all the rides / speech is in Japanese. You can still understand what is going on but quite strange for the western visitor to see your favourite characters taking in a different language!

2488,DISNEYLAND!!!,"Well what can I say - it's Disneyland! If you don't like Disneyland you're probably dead or crazy.

We arrived early and obtained fast passes as often as one can - however we found sometimes the waiting times indicated on some rides were not as long in reality. So it's good to have them anyway just in case !!!

All the rides were awesome -- I personally recommend Pooh's Hunny Hunt and Pirates of the Caribbean.","Written July 6, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2489,The happiest place on earth,"Visited Tokyo Disneyland. This was my fourth time.
I have to remind myself of the wonder and awe I had the very first time as I don't want to take 'the happiest place on earth' for granted.
On arrival we went straight for a fast pass to some of the attractions. We started in Westernland and got a fast pass for Big Thunder Mountain. Fast pass allows you to fast track entrance to a ride at a certain time (within an hour of that time). So in the meantime we went on Pirates of the Caribbean. The rides are long and visually strong. I wonder at the work that goes into the detail, it's amazing. We also had time to go on the Western River Railroad. Food and drink stalls are varied, plentiful and range in prices. We bought some well earned drinks.
Given it was summer, hot and highly humid, there are pockets that amplify this. Especially given the paving everywhere. Hydration especially with such drinks as Aquarius, Pocari Sweat and Match are a must as are comfortable walking shoes, hats, sunscreen and sunglasses.
The day continued with rides such as Splash Mountain (with the mandatory photo), It's a Small World (with that tune continually repeated while you identify all the countries the ride shows off), Haunted Mansion, Roger Rabbits Car Toon Spin, Gadgets Go Coaster, Star Tours (with 3D glasses, be careful if you get vertigo easily!), Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters to name a few. We strolled through Adventureland, Critter Country, Fantastyland, Toontown, Tommorrowland, and the World Bazaar.
We found space to watch parades and shows such as the Tanabata Greeting, the Nighttime Parade (which goes for at least 30 minutes) and Sky High Wishes (if you are there late).
We ate at Cafe Orleans and the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall. The food, service and air conditioned comfort (which occurs on many rides was welcome).
The Disney characters greetings at the main entrance were available (if you don't mind waiting) and throughout the park. I had chance to cuddle Baloo the Bear and see many others throughout the day.
Over time I used to celebrate the fact the Tokyo Disneyland had not folded to the pressure of many attractions by not keeping prices down having captive audiences but over the last four years their gifts and souvenirs and to a smaller extent their food have taken price hikes which is a shame!
Finally I went with two Princesses who felt right at home!","Written July 6, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

2491,LOVED IT!,"We live in California have been to Disneyland in Anaheim countless times. We have also been to Orlando Disney. I was a little worried about going to Tokyo Disney thinking that I would be disappointed comparing it to Disney in the United States, but my husband and I had a wonderful time! The language barrier was not a problem at all as I feared it would be. I was actually surprised by how much was in English, and it made me wonder how the Japanese felt about that. It was the least crowded Disneyland that I have ever been to with most rides only having a five to fifteen minute wait. We were there on a Wednesday in June. The longest we waited was 60 minutes for Splash Mountain (we should have thought ahead and got a fast pass). Space Mountain was closed for construction, which was fine, and they are currently building Indiana Jones, but most rides were up and running, although they didn't have some rides at all like the Matterhorn. We thought the Jungle Cruise and the TIkki Room were better than California. I loved walking through the Swiss Family Robinson Tree House which was changed to Tarzan's house in our Disneyland years ago. I agree with one reviewer that said it would be nice if they had more souvenirs that said Tokyo Disney on them. I found a few things to bring back but there weren't a lot of choices. After being in Asia for three weeks, we were hoping to have a good old Disney hamburger, but, unfortunately, we could only find a 'Mickey meat and cheese sandwich,"" which is their ""version"" of a hamburger. Of course, I realize we are in a foreign country and should not expect American food, but I really wasn't sure what to expect at an American theme park in Japan. I also have to say that the crowds of people were the most well-behaved I have ever experienced. The Japanese people and their children were so impressive with their patience in waiting in line and walking though the park. I'm afraid that, from now on, I will be comparing our Disneyland to Japan!","Written July 1, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

There are not enough eating areas considering the number of visitors and there are wait lists to use the restaurants. As such, we visited in low season, we would not have handled the peak season, especially with children.
The rides are longer than at other theme parks and once a child is 102cm, they can ride on most attractions.

It was not too busy and did not wait overly long in queues. Actually timed the queues against what the signs said. We were always quicker than the posted anticipated time. Food wise it was not expensive. Must admit half the fun of this place is seeing all the visitors dressed up. The fast ride tickets are a good idea which you are entitled to one every couple of hours. however, we only used it once as the queues were not at all long. Easy walk from the train station.

One thing unique to this place is the different flavored popcorn in every land- from ""soy sauce and butter"" (our least favorite) to black pepper (actually very yummy) and white chocolate. It's a lot of fun to go to each land and try each flavor. They also sell different shaped popcorn holders- Mr. Potato Head, R2D2, and Pooh. We enjoyed seeing everyone carrying them around. This is a great park! The restrooms were clean and the dining facilities offered a great variety of foods.","Written June 25, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2498,Beautiful and magical,"My partner and I really enjoyed our day at Disneyland. He had never been to Disneyland anywhere before and he loved it. I found it better than Disney in Florida.
It is definitely the quieter park out of the two. We lined up 30 mins before the park opened and were no where near the front. We managed to get everything we wanted to get done plus more, but we were lucky it was a quiet day with our longest wait being 20 mins.
Planning is key here. Do your research on the attractions you want to see most and the popular ones. Make use of the fast pass tickets. Get a fast pass for one ride and head towards the next ride. We got a fast pass for monsters inc then went on poohs honey hunt while waiting for fast pass time. If your lucky to have wifi there's an app that tells you waiting times for the attractions without going to the attraction to find out and helps with planning what to do next.
We enjoyed the food and didn't find it too expensive as what I was expecting.
The park is beautiful, magical and clean and doesn't show its age at all. They look after it extremely well.
We will definitely be back.","Written June 25, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2499,Kids young and old will love it!,"Ok, so I'm not young - but Disneyland just brings back your inner child! I had a wonderful day. We were there on a Saturday, so it was ridiculously busy, but we happily strolled through the crowds, taking in all the magic, colour and excitement.

The parade was amazing! I can't compliment the performers enough for the way they kept character, smiled, waved, and generally looked like they were having the time of their lives. We were lucky to see two parades, as there was also an Easter one (have a funny bunny holiday!), which was also brilliant. It was lovely to hear all the cute Japanese children exclaiming their excitement as their favourite characters went past.

Food is expensive - which is typical of all major tourist places, but you can always bring your own snacks. Never go anywhere without a water bottle! There are popcorn stands with some crazy flavours - soy sauce and butter, curry...?? Might be popular in Japan, but strange for Australians lol.

The different ""Lands"" were great - characters in costume roamed around, happily posing for photos with visitors. We saw two shows on stage - again, the performers were faultless.

Lines for some of the rides were incredibly long (well, it was Saturday) - we only went on two rides, one of which we had to wait for an hour to get on. You can always head to the rides early and use your entry ticket to get a time allocation for later in the day.

Merchandise galore for happy memories - plenty for the kids (young and old).

Also this isn't necessarily the staffs fault but do people really just sit in the middle of a busy walkway on a mat?? Surely not safe üòÇ however despite this overall it was a good experience, I would recommend arriving as early as possible especially on weekends as it was very busy... More so than I expected.

Tokyo Disneyland is super crowded no matter what the crowd calendar predicts. All the attractions can be found at Anaheim Disneyland, but the Japanese hospitality was the best. Also, with the current exchange rate, Tokyo
Disney was way more reasonable. The food was decently priced. We ate at the Alice in Wonderland restaurant and the food presentation was so cute. Plus it was comfortable and had air conditioning. One unique aspect was the many flavors of popcorn they sell. All the Japanese kids have re-full able character shaped popcorn containers with shoulder straps, which were so cute. My kids enjoyed the milk chocolate and caramel flavors best. They also had soy sauce flavor. I don't think Disneyland is a must see, would rather go next door to Disney Sea, which is fabulous (see my review).

The staff were lovely, the stores and facade were amazing and the food was definitely interesting! I recommend getting an express pass for a ride so you skip the queue (you can only get one fast pass per hour and it reserves you that privilege for a short time frame) and then using that period to shop around and eat. The queue's are disappointingly long, but hey, it is Disneyland after all! There was no way of getting around the whole place in a day, next time I would probably buy a 2-day pass to really enjoy everything and not feel rushed for time. The queue's can last up to 2 hours per ride, so if you want to ride as many as you can then it would be incredibly difficult for a one-day pass.

Also, bring cash if you plan on buying snacks from the little kiosks stationed at different areas of the parks.

2542,Happiest Place to Be!,"Happiness everywhere in the park, unless you didn't get a fast pass. Whenever you can, get the fast pass. However if you come on a non peak period's day, most of the rides are pretty fast. The best ride I had was Space Mountain, really thrilling. The wait time was 45 minutes, but I managed to get a fast pass. That reduced to about 5-8 minutes. The fast pass works by placing your ticket's qr code into a machine near the ride, you will obtain a ticket with the time stamped. I managed to get a fast pass for 3 rides in the same day.
The most disappointing thing for me was the fireworks which was non-existent. There was a few flares, that's it. Maybe the weather was not good, but I definitely did not get to see any fireworks.
The parade on the other hand was great. It was enjoyable for all my friends. The day time parade was better than the night electric one.
Food wise, I managed to get my hands on some Green Alien(Toy Story) Mochi which was fantastic. The chicken leg was better than the turkey leg due to it's tenderness and juiciness.
The staff there were extremely polite and helpful. They did a fantastic job keeping the park clean and organized. Kudos to the staff.","Written May 16, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2543,A childhood dream fulfilled,"Many friends of mine said Disneyland is for kids, but for me, I will definitely say it's not only for kids but for adults who love Disney characters. I was so excited and happy when I enter the Mickey arch and the moment I get in to Disneyland entrance I was like Oh My God, I am here finally and I almost tears because of my excitement and my childhood dream was fulfilled.

I spent the whole day yet i can't take all the ride due to long Q. You have to choose which ride you wanted the most and go and get your fast past. Fast Past helps you to avoid Q yet you can spend your time for photo shooting or walking around while waiting for your ride time slot.

For photograph with Mickey you are required to be a little patient for the waiting time. It takes about 45minutes for your turn. Just enjoying yourself with all the lovely Disney character and the ride is awesome! I love Disneyland!","Written May 15, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Tried to get hold of the express tokens, but they were out by the time we learned about them. Such a shame. But nevertheless, there's a lot to do at the park.

They have a page that shows the percentage booked the park is. The day we were there (midweek) was around 55-60% from memory and it was great. Our longest queue was around 60 mins and most were more like 35-40min.

As you expect from Disney, it's slick and well run, it's clean and a lot of fun. We've done Hong Kong Disneyland before and that's our only one to compare to but one thing to keep in mind is that there's only a couple of rides that aren't really designed for little kids.

No matter how old you are what is more fun than Disneyland. I went on a Tuesday and from what I was told this is one of the slower days. Didnt wait to long for rides in the morning but once all the schools were out by the afternoon the lines soon filled up and the wait longer. If you want to watch the show ""One Mans Dream"" about Walt Disney you need your passport and go into a lotto to get tickets after the first show. The parade was good fun and Japanese know how to let everyone watch a show without the pushing and shoving. I had to get my head around seeing Mickey and Minnie speak Japanese and other characters and also shows sung in Japanese but your in Japan what do you expect but took nothing away from my day. Souvenirs expensive once I converted back to Australian dollar and there are plenty of shops to wander through. Very clean park and plenty of help if you need to find something.

This is impossible with little children. Thank goodness for fastpass, but even that was difficult to get unless you arrive very early at opening time. Such a fun park but let down by the overcrowding & queues for everything - toilets, food, rides & gift shops. I could barely move in the gift shops & have never experience so many people in one place. Even 30 minutes just to get a bag of popcorn from a street stand. You couldn't even walk through the streets or shops without brushing up against people constantly. Disneysea was slightly less crowded.","Written May 1, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles

We decided on Disneyland because it's the most like Disney and its atmosphere/design. I'm so glad we picked it!!! We bought our tickets early and then got there before it opened (highly recommended). We familiarized ourselves with the map (highly recommended) so we didn't waste time. We went on a weekday and stayed all day. Best choice ever! We got about 5 different Fastpasses and rode/saw about everything at least once. The Once Upon a Time show at the end of the night is totally worth it!!!! I thought it was amazing.
Definitely worth it and I'd go again in a heartbeat!","Written April 29, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2558,kids love it,"We came here by Nov 2015. We came before opening time i.e. 8:30 am, there were so crowding seem 1000 people waiting outside already. The park is moderate size, clean and well maintained. Most of the visitors are local. I agree with the other traveler's reviews. Yes, there is too crowding as kids have to waste long time for long queue. Luckily there is a fast-pass machine outside every ride's entrance, we just need to scan the entrance ticket and get a pass to skip for queue up, but this is limit to one time per each ticket.
I suggest stay a whole day here as there is a firework show at night. I love the road show and the ambiance of Disneyland. Must come at least once if you gonna to visit Tokyo.","Written April 28, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

There was a Light Parade on early night, awesome and breath-taking!
A special exhibition projected in Princess's Castle also took place, but we didn't know, so we lost our good spot (it was hard to see the animations if you were not on the front.

The attractions are not as radical as I imagined, and I lost 2 hours waiting for the wood roller coaster, which was not exciting at all (recommended for kids).

You can have really good meals with a fair price. I recommend the Curry from Wood area, Turkey Leg (expensive but worth it!), and Mickey Mouse Sandwich.

There are rides for all levels of thrills, from the merry go round to the roller coasters. We had Mickey Mouse waffles which are a must to try.

2565,Must visit for Disney Park fans!,"We only had a day to spend and didn't feel like we got to really explore the park but we really enjoyed the experience.

There's quite a few resources online to help plan your visit but the tips we found most helpful were to stay on property as the 15 minutes extra was very helpful to get to the Fast Pass machines and attractions. (We grabbed FPs for the two rides that were unique to Japan, Pooh's Hunny Hunt and Monster's Inc.) We also found that the guest are perfectly willing to wait hours for a ride and do so in a polite manner. We didn't find English to be a problem but we didn't really need to go beyond the basics either of ordering food or saying how many for a ride.

Maps are available in English, as are the signs for each restaurant/attraction/bathrooms and cast members are perfectly willing to accept gestures and pointing in lieu of Japanese or call someone over who can speak English. Be sure to look at the lottery system for several of the attractions as well, if you're lucky you'll get a better seat for fireworks/shows.

Despite the long waits and crowds, the park was still a wonderful experience with guests being thoughtful and really enjoying themselves. Children are not allowed on shoulders, first rows will sit down and guests will automatically pull down their umbrellas, even if it's drizzling, so that everybody has a good view of parades and fireworks. Cameras are also requested to be held no higher than your head if you're taking pictures.

All in all, we enjoyed our experience but think it's going to be a one time thing due to the distance and amount of time/crowds. Disney fans should really put this and TokyoSea on their lists of parks to visit, both to see the differences (and similarities) as well as experience how different cultures respond to attractions and park itself. (Lots of Duffy, excitement and rock star squealing for parade characters, extremely polite and well mannered 40-60 minute lines for snack carts, automatic and NEAT queuing for everything, efficient transportation / everything starts when as posted, amazing details to everything ...completely mobbed shopping experiences in the stores, despite the lack of merchandise variety.)","Written April 25, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Firstly this place is not just for kids, it's for anyone who still likes to have fun laugh and enjoy life.
The happiest place i have ever been to everyone is happy, everyone is laughing, everyone is enjoying themselves.
Now your visit to Disneyland starts before you leave your house, do your homework, read reviews and PLAN. It was just my wife and myself so our plan was we are to old for rides so do we want a day pass or a two day pass? Day pass was our decision.
We think we saw everything in a whole day, got there shortly after the crowds got thru the gates so no queuing, yet. There are queues for everything eating, rides, toilets, information desk, patience required in abundance.
Once we had our map we planned which way we would go and where to stand to view parade (important otherwise you end up 10 deep). There are rules on how close you get to the front to watch a parade, sitting down in front standing at the back very organised.
We had lunch we had snacks we did everything we could in a day except go on the rides. We stayed for the fireworks (weather dependent) we were lucky, saw the night castle show.
There is happy music and songs playing the whole time even though we were so tired we were to happy and having fun to complain about it.
The shops have every conceivable souvenir imaginable of every Disney character you have ever known. Very easy to blow the budget here especially when have family back home let alone what we loved to buy for ourselves.
It's awesome fun you have to visit Disneyland, if you do plan to visit Tuesday to Thursday are 3 of the quietest days (i didn't think so) we went on a Thursday and it was claimed it was at 60% of what it could be? If you have children minimum two days, we had lunch with a couple with 2 children and they had a three day pass.
Lots of people using fast passes for the rides, there is also standby (don't know how that works) anyways just plan, plan, before you leave home.

Evening show such as electrical parade and Cinderella show is spectacular, leaving us with everlasting memories, specially for the kids.

One of the highlight: I lost my purse, containing 4 Passports and cash money, somewhere in the restaurant, sometime after lunch.

Mind you, I did check the Tokyo Disney anticipated crowd calendar prior to booking to ensure we were there on a relatively low activity day. Monsters Inc was a bit lame and not worth it in my opinion. The buzz lightyear ride was much more interactive and worth the Fastpass. We ate Queen of hearts banquet hall for lunch and Crystal palace buffet for dinner (you need a booking). Food was good and plentiful. The electric parade to finish the day was spectacular.

2597,Good fun for the kids,"We got a 3 day pass, which allowed us to visit one park on the first day, the other park on the second, and either or both parks on the third. The park was packed with locals even on weekdays, so sadly we didn't get to enjoy most of the rides since the queuing time was crazy. They have a fast pass system that allow you to get priority tickets for a certain period of time. So with some careful planning, one can get to try the more popular rides in the park.

There are 2 shows at night, starting from around 8pm. One light show that is projected onto the Disney castle, and a fireworks show. Do stay behind after the first show so that you won't miss the second one. There are also the parades by Disney characters throughout the day.

Even the shops an restaurants are packed with people. Prices are quite decent and not too expensive. The souvenirs and food items are really to die for. Packaging is all so nice and makes you want to buy everything.","Written April 13, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2598,Best Disneyland in Asia,"Although some reviewers think that the Japanese language in all rides and amusements is a disadvantage, our girls found it intriguing. We've been trying to learn Japanese words before leaving and they were so excited when we were greeted by the Frozen parade with Anna and Elsa saying Konnichiwa!!! And we were able to watch this parade in the entire day we were there. Check out their website for schedules as planning ahead allows you to accomplish more within the park.

A disneyland will also be crowded and the long lines are a given but the cool climate makes the wait pleasant.

I highly recommend!","Written April 12, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2599,Had a great but long day,"We only had a day to devote to Disneyland. Managed to do all that we wanted and were lucky that it wasnt too crowded. The longest line we were in was around 30 minutes (advertised as 50 minutes), we found the actual wait was around one-half to two-thirds the advertised time. We only used one fastpass, but avoided the most popular rollercoasters as our young daughter wasnt interested. The staff were friendly and helpful but hefood was typical of all parks - overpriced and ordinary. All and all we had a lovely day.","Written April 12, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

The staff are unbelievably kind and helpful, I was amazed!

If you don't speak Japanese, most staffs can speak English, but unfortunately attractions like theatres/show types are always in Japanese (no English subtitles) so best to stick to action based attractions.","Written April 7, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2604,Soooooo busy!,"We stupidly went in the Japanese school holidays so the queues were 5-and-a-half hours long for most rides and the fast passes were mostly gone when we arrived at 10 am. They had also shut the park to people who had not pre-purchased a ticket, thankfully (or not) we had! The best time to get there was 8 am, opening time. We did go on one ride, Star Tours which was good and saw a show and the Disney Parade so the kids were happy.","Written April 7, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2605,Crowded place in Spring,"We visited in late March. Thankfully, we had purchased our day passes in advance, since the park was sold out by 9:30am. Apparently this happens quite often, so do not assume that you can get in just by showing up. The park was extremely crowded. Wait times for popular rides were 3-4 hours long and fast passes for most rides were closed by 11am. The lines just for popcorn and drinks were 30 minutes long. Spending all day at the park we were able to go on about 3 rides- Space Mountain, Small World and Peter Pan. The park itself is identical to California Disneyland and we found virtually no merchandise (shirts, etc) which even indicated that we were at the Tokyo park. Somewhat disappointing. We thought it would be novel to attend, but in retrospect, would not recommend.","Written April 7, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2606,Truly the Happiest Place on Earth,We went around 3pm so lines were gone. We went there specifically for the Dream Lights Parade and the fireworks since previous reviewers said it was one of the park's highlights. We agree. The kids were in awe at the lights and the characters. We have seen the parade during the morning (in HK and LA) so this was definitely something new. Make sure you start lining up along the roads atleast 30 minutes before the parade starts to get a good spot.,"Written April 7, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2607,Fantastic!,"We had a brilliant time at Disneyland. Generally it was amazing.
The language barrier was a problem at times as the staff couldn't always help and often didn't know times of character greetings etc. Also, the Japanese communicate no by holding up their arms in an X shape which comes across as quite aggressive which was uncomfortable to see (something to be aware of if travelling with young children!) Other than that, it was great, really great!","Written April 7, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2608,Go Off Season,"This was actually my third visit to Tokyo Disney Land...something I didn't realize; though the park is *mostly* the same, there are some differences...No Matterhorn ride, and Mr. Toads Wild Ride is replaced by a similar Roger Rabbit Ride, as those were two of my favorite rides from my childhood growing up near Disney Land in Anaheim Ca., I just thought I'd mention that.

Make sure you are well-aware of Japanese holidays and public school scheduled...to avoid them! Japan is a crowded place, but like every else gets more crowded over spring-break and summer vacation!

Advice: Food can be expense and lines long...plan ahead and leave something in backpack in a coin locker outside the park (inside the park they will be full). You can get a reentry stamp to get back in.

Buy your tickets online and get the 2-day passport for Tokyo Disney Sea and Tokyo Disney Land, this will save you a ton of money if you are going to go to both. Disney Land does take American Express, VISA, and MC, but you will want some cash for food. Buy your souvenirs on the way out of the park, and plan on getting a foot massage afterwards!

One interesting note. I took my family over Spring Break in Japan, and the local JHS and HS girls tend to all dress the same and travel in groups. It was really cute and the loved it when westerners took pictures with them! It makes for some fun memories.","Written April 7, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2609,Great for Disney fans,"This park is set up very similar to Magic Kingdom in Orlando having replicas of the different areas (fantasy land etc.) and rides. The park is pretty large and has a very nice main street area in the beginning which is covered and very large (shops and food). Overall, the food was very good and reasonably priced including snacks and sit down meals. There is a subculture of popcorn (and the popcorn buckets) as there are various stands with unique flavors (including honey, curry, soy sauce and butter) and a lot of people purchase a popcorn bucket that hangs around your neck so you can snack as you walk and wait in line. The Winnie the Pooh ride which was unique (in terms of Orlando) was very fun and visually impressive. Most of the other rides were direct replicas but were humorous to see with Japanese spoken for the characters (Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, etc.). My only true complaint would be the lines for most rides were long (including the popcorn) and the rides were short and contained in smaller buildings. If you are a fan of Disney I would highly recommend just for the experience and the price is very moderate compared to the Orlando parks.","Written April 6, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2610,Kids loved it but the wait lines are ridiculous,"We went in knowing the long waits for rides but they where ridiculous more than three hours for some of the popular rides. It made the day very long.

Fast passes make a big difference. Plan your day out in advance and you will get on quite a few rides.

Food was well priced and I didn't feel overcharged for anything whilst there.

Be patient your day will be ok","Written April 6, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2611,Different Disneyland Experience,"I have been to all Disneyland... Anaheim, Florida, Paris, HongKong and now Tokyo. I have been here once when i was young, 10 years old so i didn't remember anything. This is my 1st visit back as an adult. I went to Tokyo disneyland with my husband and 10 years old daughter. We just visited Anaheim Disneyland this summer so everything is fresh to us. Anaheim has more rides than this Disneyland. Maybe thats why the line are so long in Tokyo Disneyland. Every ride, the line is 1-2 hours long. Even for food there is a very long line. We used fast pass but the fast pass ended early. Some rides already out of fast pass by day time Thank goodness i just came back from Anaheim Disneyland so we are not very disappointed for not being able to ride a lot of rides. The unique thing about Tokyo Disneyland are the people that goes there. So many Japanese wearing cute costume or uniform. It is so good for people watching. Also the park is very clean. They also have weird flavour of popcorn... They have honey popcorn, cappuccino popcorn, and other weird flavour... so that was cool. Overall.. i have good experience.... Always love Disneyland...","Written April 6, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2612,Disney Disappointment,"There are 37 million people in Tokyo and it felt like every one of them went to Disneyland on Good Friday. The lines were huge and the Fastpass ended early. We were only able to get one Fastpass. We watched as 12 people from the regular line were admitted to the Monsters, Inc. ride while 31 people from the Fastpass line went in. Perhaps that is a normal ratio but it was very frustrating after waiting for over 2 hours. Lines were long for food and even the restrooms. My family loves Disney but I would not return to this park.","Written April 5, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2613,Too many people - go to HK instead,"We just made the very huge mistake of going to Tokyo Disneyland over Japanese Spring Break. I live in China and still this the most people that I have experienced in one place ... lines were 3+ hours in many places - sometimes even the Fastpass ticket lines were 1+ hours!

The park itself is just like Disney at any of the other parks (at least, we have been to Anaheim, FL and Hong Kong) and if you have young kids who like to go on rides instead of standing in long lines then I would suggest either spending most of your time at DisneySea (really fantastic experience) or skipping this all together.

That being said, I would suggest a few tips to make your visit more tolerable:
(1) Get to the park as early as possible. If you can get into the park before 9, you can get a Fastpass AND at least 1-2 rides during the first hour. We got to the park by 7:30 (8 am opening) every day and still had to wait ~30 min to actually get into the park.
(2) Take the monorail in if you are at one of the partner hotels. They close a gate to the subway bridge/parking lots/walkway prior to opening so that the only people who can actually queue are those who ride the monorail. This saves a lot of time.
(3) Relax and see the first parade at Tomorrowland caf√©. The parade route goes over a bridge right by the Tomorrowlad caf√© terrace. This means that you can sit in real chairs and have no one blocking your view! We got there at 10:00, grabbed a table outside, ate our food and then were able to see the 11 am parade - was a great break from the frustrations of the rest of the visit.

Overall, we have to say that we were extremely disappointed with this Disney trip especially when they pride themselves on the customer experience.","Written April 3, 2016",3.0 of 5 bubbles

They had an amazing show located at Cinderella's castle which was unique to this Disney Land and was was of the neatest things I have ever seen.

2619,The Happiest Place on Earth! :),"It's Tokyo & Disneyland put together so as long as you're PREPARED for the ridiculous crowds you'll have the best day ever!!

Prepare: Take food from home to avoid the long lines(7/11 is great for this). Research the rides you'd like to do, which ones have the fast pass system(research this and use it to your advantage). Download/print a map before your trip & know where things are. Know a little bit of Japanese to help you on the day, hello, thank you, excuse me etc

We arrived into the train station a little after 7am and it was already packed. You stand in a line to get your bag checked and then another to go in the gate. We were in the park by 8.15am. Definitely recommend arriving at least an hour before opening!

Most of the day you'll be in one type of a line or another, don't let it get to you, get the map out & plan things to do later, play 20 questions about Disney characters, just look around & be happy that you're in Disneyland!!

The parades are definitely a highlight! We ended up being able to do 8 rides throughout the day plus parades, shopping and food breaks! If you're prepared you'll enjoy all the craziest even more :)","Written March 30, 2016",5.0 of 5 bubbles

2627,Fast Pass messed up everything,"From 10 in the morning till 8 at night, we rode 3 rides! It was a 200 minute wait and I kid you not for a ride on Splash Mountain. Fast pass were given in the morning and although we managed to only get for 1 ride, maybe it would have been only 2 rides through that one day!. we felt that it did not do justice to those waiting in standby queues.. We and some other people waiting in line did count that fast pass customers were let into rides at a ratio of almost 5:1. so if you are one of the ""stupid"" people not to queue early in the morning for fast passes for the evening rides, you probably are lucky to get to ride 2 or 3 attractions through the whole day. It was packed the day we went and i am sure they did proper math in calculating the fast pass and regular visitors ratio, it didnt work the day we were there. something is clearly wrong. The ride that i was really looking forward to Pirates of the Carribean was closed. Haunted Mansion had a breakdown. Was a total raw deal and my children's first Disney visit turned out to be a really big let down. I would take them Anaheim Disney but never Tokyo disney again. I have to give the big ups on the park being spotless and staff were all amazing people. But thats more of a culture thing rather than anything to do with DIsney.

People watching was probably a highlight and the parade really was spectacular.

We had come on a Thursday not in school holidays but this didn't seem to make any difference, unfortunately it was so crowded that we only got to go on one ride. After only being able to secure one fast pass that was within a reasonable time. (Not 2045 at night). (I refuse to wait 100mins for a 2 min ride).

The food was not great and even the popcorn vendors had lines about 40-50 people deep.

We left feeling ripped off and generally dissatisfied.

Hints if you are going:

Get there early and have a plan of the ride/s you want to go on.

Use the fast passes! But this only works for one ride really, as once you get one you can't get another for 2 more hrs (and by then they are often sold out so pick your favourite). To give you an idea there is even queing areas for the fast pass machines.

Pack snacks as getting ANY food is a wait of at least 25-30mins

The ease in getting around, lack of long queues and array of things to do was more than enough to fill in at least one day. A highlight would have to the popcorn vending machines all had different flavours. I highly recommend the soy sauce.

2649,Good Disney Park,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland with some friends in August 2015. If this was a park owned by any other company it'd easily get 5 stars, but for Disney, it does lack...something.

We all had a great day. We loved riding the traditional Disney rides like Splash Mountain, Star Tours, Space Mountain, I also loved Winnie the Pooh's Honey Hunt. There is so much to do for all the family, kids especially.

Don't miss one of the shows, my favourite was the fireworks at the end, they were amazing.

There are plenty of places to eat too, we ate in the Queen of Heart's restaurant which was impeccably themed, good value and just really nice. We also bought snacks throughout the day.

It is a great park, but only a good Disney park, the atmosphere is slightly lacking compared to the likes of Florida's equivalent, and I don't like how Maine Street has a roof on it but it does make sense given Tokyo's climate.

There are also plenty of ships to purchase gifts and souvenirs. Japanese theme parks in general seem to specialise in cookies and biscuits, a great gift for anyone!

I would recommend Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear's Shooting Ride.

We also stayed in the Disney hotel which was beautiful. I would recommend this although it is pricey because you get an extra 15 minutes in the park than the day visitors do. It doesn't sound like much, but during this time you can get fast passes for attractions. I managed to do around 2-3 rides in the 15 minutes.

The very first thing I did was familiarise myself with the fast pass system which is very important because it means you don't have to waste time lining up on popular attractions.

Not worth visiting during peak season due to fast pass system wasn't that beneficial to visitor as you have to queue early for famous ride and it will then release after 2/3 hours in order to get the second fast pass. By that time, the fast pass for your desirable ride might be out which is very disappointing. The queue was about 80-160minutes during peak season. You might end up played few rides in the park for one day which is totally not worth for the price that you pay for. The food is quite pricey as this is Disney. Popcorn was sold at 310yen and popcorn with container was sold at 1600-2100yen depends on characters. Long anticipated fireworks show at 8.30pm was cancelled due to weather same goes to Disneysea.

Pretty fun and got some awesome pictures of it. We had heard about the crowds and how everyone rushes to get back to Toy Story...we waited till an hour after opening to enter because we had heard about this. There is a line for fast passes, but manageable. Get Toy Story fast passes first as it seems to be the most liked ride. Our time wasn't until that evening so they go quickly! Purchase a popcorn container (we got the alien from toy story) and get refills throughout the day. Such unique flavors like bubble tea, jalapeno, caramel, chocolate, etc. Fortunately the rate of exchange was good for US travelers so it was really reasonable!

2676,For Kids and Kid at Heart,"Disneyland is truly for children and also grown up with kid at heart. Though more rides are suitable for younger teenager, unlike Universal Studio which more suitable for older teenager.
Disneyland Tokyo is huge, it make Disney HK just like one of Disney Tokyo themeland. Though there are some similarities in certain rides/attractions - space mountain, it's a small world, Tom Sawyer Island Rafts, tree house. So, for those who have been to Disney HK, perhaps they can skip those rides/attractions and try others rides instead. This is because, Disney Tokyo is famous for over crowd, and it is almost impossible for one to have a chance to try all the rides in a day, 2 or 3 days more likely. Another tip, avoid weekend if possible.
Star Tour is a must, especially for Star Wars fan. Though not that thrill or one of its' kind ride, but it is still a Star Wars experience. Haunted Mansion also recommendable, especially for whole family, only thing is, like other rides too, everything is in Japanese, so kind of not so scary for non japanese speaking riders.
For muslim visitors, there is basically no restaurant that offers halal meal (unlike Disney HK), perhaps the management should consider to provide one, to cater for muslims visitors. However, one could exit the park (to have meal) and re admit (just required an invisible ink stamped on your hand).
Given a choice, if one only have a day to spent at disney park, perhaps DisneySea is a better choice and it is the only Disney Sea in the world.","Written January 10, 2016",4.0 of 5 bubbles

I get in around 10am and straight to fast pass for the new STAR TOURS ride at 10:30am. After finished the ride around 11am I managed to take fast past for the SPACE MOUNTAIN, but the next fast pass was for 7pm, can you believe it? So I bailed out thinking maybe because space mountain is high tech one and probably other ride would be more time-friendly. But, I was wrong, all thrill ride fast past were already for 7:30pm up. Omigawd, so I took BIG THUNDER as it looks furious, my fast pass for big thunder was for 8pm (Oh men, that means I've got to spend the whole day there until 8pm). Almost all big ride waiting time were for 2 hours or so. All fast pass were sold out quickly that day.

So to fill in my time, I went to small rides (mostly for small kids) that I totally never ride in theme park (like train, ship, it's a small world, canoe). It was okay, better than nothing. At least the waiting time was around 30-45mins each.

Cafe and restaurants were packed. All booking pass were also sold out. So I have to wait for 45mins-1hr for lunch in the restaurant.

After I finished my lunch I checked the waiting time for all rides and the waiting time for space mountain became 130mins, WHAT! No sign of those people to give up.

Anyway, I enjoyed the castle, shops and parades. At 8pm right after the parade I ride the Big Thunder and it was worth it! The ride was awesome, and since it was night time, everywhere was dark and that gave some chills.

Don‚Äôt forget to check the ENTERTAINMENT SCHEDULE so you could have an idea of what the Park have prepared for the day, especially that some of these activities overlap with each other. And if a day in the park wouldn‚Äôt be enough, you can always check the GUEST RELATIONS WINDOWS on how to upgrade your park ticket so you can go back the next day for a discounted rate.

Japanese Disney fans are on a completely different level, some of them dress head to toe in clothing featuring their favourite characters, others tote around their Duffys, buy them costumes and take pictures of them (of and not with them). All of this makes for a great atmosphere and a completely different Disney experience.

Micky waffles and Mickey churros are a staple at Disney parks, but Tokyo Disneyland also had things like Little Green Men Mochi balls and Scrumplings which were not only aesthetically pleasing but tasted amazing. Also, if you like popcorn then be prepared to be constantly trying new flavours and collecting the popcorn containers. The pork rice rolls are also a must try.

I was a bit jaded with Disneyland itself, as it was not much different from other Disneylands. But the enthusiasm and the dedication of the Japanese casts were way up there, maybe even unrivaled.
Did I mentioned the visitors? I was excited because they were excited! The best analogy I can think of, is watching a comedy in a theater, and the patrons sitting around you were roaring with laughters.

The size of the park is vast but easy to navigate. English literate guests should visit the Guest Services office upon entry to the park to obtain maps printed in English. The maps available at the turnstiles cater to Japanese, Chinese and Korean literates.

Needless to say, everything is in Japanese inside the park. We're in Japan! Characters speak Japanese, shows are in Japanese, parades and performances are in Japanese. The good thing is instructions for rides are also available in English and menu at eateries are also available in English.

Food served in the park is generally nice and too pretty to be eaten. Although, prices are much pricier than the outside.

The rides in the park are mild but very enjoyable. Guests with certain medical and physical conditions should ask the ride attendants and read ride warnings carefully before taking the ride. Fast Passes are fairly easy to obtain at the designated rides. We had a very pleasant experience with one of the park staff at a ride when we realized we were one Fast Pass short because we had scanned a same passport twice while at the machines. She was polite and patient and ensured us that it is alright as she arranged for her colleagues further inside the ride to admit us altogether despite the missing Fast Pass. Well-done, Tokyo Disneyland! We are so coming back again!","Written December 25, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

This year we went before Christmas and the queues and waiting time weren't as bad. The period between Christmas Eve to New Year's Day is absolutely the worst time to go as the waiting times become 3-4 hours and the park gets too crowded. Even waiting to buy popcorn and food takes an hour.","Written December 24, 2015",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Not having been there in a few years, it certainly was a different scene.
Therefore, I would strongly suggest that should you wish to visit it, try to avoid doing so on a weekend and public holidays. I am told that even during a working week day or school day, somehow the locals are there in large numbers.
The locals totally support this theme park and will freely spend on souvenirs, food and what not.
The queues for rides and for food, even popcorn, were ridiculously long as we there on a Saturday.
Other than that, it is still the happiest place on earth.
The parades still brought lots of smiles and spread lots of cheer!","Written December 23, 2015",3.0 of 5 bubbles

Even though everyone follows the rules and order it does gets to you if you have to queue up for everything inside the theme park. From food to rides to restrooms. Do spend 2 days there if you want to cover all rides and shows. Most if the time spend was for queueing for things. I travelled there with 2 children under the age of 10 and 2 elderly folks. I admit I do have to take it slow. I was there during a weekday. It was packed with tourist and locals too. Remember this, but as long as you start queuing you will get there.

You can see many high spirited people buying Tokyo Disneyland's merchandises and using it right away without any hesitation at all! For example, you can see people wearing a funny green and blue Monster Inc hoodie with three eyes on top. Even if let say you (feel) old and is just coming to Tokyo Disneyland to accompany your family, it is a very interesting sight to see how the Japanese and foreigners enjoy their day here in Tokyo Disneyland!

I'm 34 but in Disneyland I'm 34 going on 4. Hehe. We were travelling with our 2.5 years old son, who seems to also had so much fun (in between his naps).

We were surprised that there were quite a lot of attractions to cater for his age too. Be warn the queues are indeed long so we did not really bother covering all rides even the ones without height restriction.

2710,A great visit to one of the best Disney theme parks,"We had a great experience at Tokyo Disneyland. We spent one day there (Friday) and the day before at Tokyo Disney Sea (Thursday). We purchased our tickets the night before at the hotel we were staying at (Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay) so we wouldn't have to stand in line to buy tickets the next morning. We got a late start, which I don't recommend as the lines only get longer as the day goes on, and got in the park at around 10am. We went straight to Monster's Inc. to get a Fast Pass and the return time was already past 5pm, then straight to Pooh's Hunny Hunt. That was our longest wait of the day, maybe 65-70 minutes. The rest of the day, we grabbed FP's and were able to ride everything we wanted with minimal wait. We also watched the Dreamlights Parade which was awesome and a part of the show where they project animation onto the castle (also awesome). We had dinner at Queens of Hearts restaurant and although the food was okay, the theming was amazing, especially the stained glass window. I would suggest not going to the shops right before closing, which is what we did, because it was packed with people wanting to buy that last souvenir. We had a great time at TDR and TDS and can't wait to go back.","Written December 20, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2711,Cold Disney,"We went with 2 young children, one still in stroller. This is not our first Disney trip so we know the queuing time and how Japanese love the Disney parade.
We went on a Thursday and the average q time for most attractions are 15 to 30mins. Those popular ones require 60mins which we didn't try cos it is cold in winter.
I watched the parade with my girl in stroller however I was asked to close my stroller repeatedly which I told them I couldn't as my girl needs to sit in the stroller to watch the parade. By the 4th time, the staff asked me to get out of the sitting area, rather rudely. Maybe it is a miscommunication or a difficult in perishing herself in proper English, I still find it rude to talk to me with a young toddler on hand in that situation. The parade was just seconds away. I fumbled and just bring out my toddler and leave the pram sideways.
After this bad experience, I was still in shock and didn't really enjoy the rest of the day. So be prepared to collapse your stroller if you are having one in disneyland Tokyo.","Written December 18, 2015",3.0 of 5 bubbles

There is a fastpass system but even that requires some queuing and waiting for you timing. The Q for non fast pass rides seem to start from a min of 30min but gets better later in the day where people starts gathering in front of the castle for fireworks.

That said, with proper planning, getting fastpass for popular rides as early as possible and running to get the next one whenever you are eligible, you may still be able to cover most of the popular rides.

Waiting time for popular rides were mostly under 1 hour. The longest we waited was 50 minutes. So, it is good to avoid public holidays, local school holidays and weekends.

It would dark already by then and the park closes at 8pm. There were just too many people there and there were long queues everywhere, to the toilets, to purchase food and to go on rides. etc The parades were good to watch, day and night parades.

I been to the one in Hong Kong. So I can only make comparisons between the two.

We took trains from Shinjuku station where a transfer is needed.... Transferred was a bit too much to walk...

I bought the tickets online to save time on queuing. But ended up we went in the late morning where there isn't any queue.

This is a cute and beautiful park with so many cute decorations. The biggest problem is sure to be the queue... Wasted a lot of time queuing... Managed to get a fast pass... Realised it too late... So overall we only get to enjoy about 6-7 rides...

Love the parades (day and night), the firework... But not so on the screening after firework... Maybe because we do not understand Japanese... Of course not to forget the popcorn bucket... My girls were Super excited!

Didn't get to buy lots of Disney gifts. Thinking that I can get it the next day at Disneysea. However, Disneysea has limited but a little bit different sets of Disney gifts. We shopped in the gift shop almost before the park closure and managed to stay in the shops till 10:30pm...

Lastly, checked on the weather before you go... If tickets aren't bought online. I bought it online few days before I travelled, weather forecast was accurate...

I wanted to purchase a nice Disney jacket or cardigan, both of which I have previously purchased at WDW but there was nothing other than a handful of very (ugly) sweatshirts.

Don't miss Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monsters Inc. attractions as they either unique to the park or sufficiently different enough to justify the wait - use a FastPass if you can.

The organisation here is great and the parades very well organised with Cast Members ensuring everyone is respectful and not blocking other guests views of the parades.

Its good that the fastpass system is fair and included within the admission price unlike other theme parks where you have to pay more for the express ticket.

The parades were really good with everyones favourite characters. The rides didnt seem tired maybe thats because it was my first visit or maybe because the rides like splash mountain arent related to a film that came out decades ago. Staff were super friendly and helpful though more english throughtout the park would be helpful to western visitors.

Read up on what the popular rides are, where they are and what time they open before you get there so that you can utilise every minute. And make sure youre there early otherwise youll be queing behind lots of people just to get in.","Written December 11, 2015",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The electric show at night was spectacular and is definitely something you don't want to miss. The food was expensive so probably best to bring snacks to save.

The park is clean and tidy. Now onto the bad part. I have never seen a theme park so busy in my life! You could honestly not walk easily around the park. The queues for rides were ridiculous we got on 5 rides when there were many more we wanted to do but didn't get the chance. You can get a fast pass for some rides but there are so many given out for each hour of the day that your time to use it would be at a stupid time when you would probably be on your way home! It would be easier to just sell fast pass tickets as extras as I wouldn't of minded paying an extra ¬£40 if that meant I got on all the rides. If I'm being honest when I come back to Japan I will not be going back to Disney land as the crowds were a major off put and did kind of spoil our day. When lunch time comes around trying to find food or a seat is impossible! We queued for half and hour for a pizza then had to sit by some bins to eat it!

Be prepared to wait at least an hour for most rides, for all dining options (pop corn carts included).

Parades are popular, and the best spots are taken up about an hour before the show starts. People are serious about laying out their mats and enjoying some down time just to wait 60 mins till parade time.

- The park is very clean and the staff are friendly.

CONS
- Lines can frequently run over two hours for major attractions.
- Expensive foods inside the park and no Halal foods for Muslim.

Getting out to Disneyland from central Tokyo was relatively straightforward, we took a train from Tokyo station which took us about 15 minutes, the train was full of kids and adults alike dressed up in their Disney costumes, clearly excited about their day ahead.

2756,Would be fun if the crowds were smaller,"It is Disneyland and has most of the main attractions you'd expect (though smaller than the LA one). So from that point of view, if you've never been to Disneyland and are keen to go, it is worth it just for the experience.

However, the lines are enormous!! When we got there at 9am, lines for the most popular rides were already over 200 minutes!!! When we tried to use our fast passes at about 9:30am, the earliest available time for some of those rides was about 7-8pm at night. Even getting popcorn meant standing in line for 20 minutes or so.

I think in LA Disneyland there were Disney characters walking all around that you could get photos with, etc (I went as a kid many years ago). In Tokyo, you have to line up for about 10mins or so in one of only a couple of spots where Mickey and others make brief appearances - fine for us as adults, but pretty slack for little kids. Even the gift shops were incredibly crowded.

There is a parade (I think around 2pm or so) which is worth seeing.

In short: If you've never been to another Disneyland and are keen, you may as well. Otherwise, don't go and expect to do more than 1-2 rides and much else the entire day, other than push through crowds.","Written January 15, 2014",3.0 of 5 bubbles

2760,"A great Disney experience, but way too crowded","Disneyland Tokyo is a must for Disney lovers, but not a must for first time visitors to Japan. Give it a chance if you have one day to spare. Disneyland Tokyo is a really beautiful place, with a lot of attractions, but so crowded by Japanese that it is really stressful. FastPasses run out extremely quickly, and some attractions have an average queue of 2 hours, a big con. Do not expect to go to the SpaceMountain without waiting +1 hour. So you will spend the whole day and probably miss some attractions. We were there on Halloween, so it was a great experience because of the additional ornaments. Japanese are always very attentive, so that was a plus too. Pop corn is sold in several alternatives (salty, curry, caramel, soy, etc.) so try them. Another big plus is the quality of the fast food, really above any fast food I have tried in any theme park. Entrance fee is 6200 YEN (62 USD), so much cheaper than Orlando's.","Written January 7, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Minimum wait for a ride is 45mins. Most of them are over 90mins (longest was 130mins at that day).
At the day we went, there were only one photo time (about 30mins) with the Disney characters. You can image how long the queue was and how many people(mainly kids) were disappointed at the end.
We had to miss the main parade because we were half way in the queue to a ride where we had been waiting for 30 mins. Will you give it up at that point? The night parade was fantastic! It was the only highlight of the day because the highly expected fire work was cancelled due to the windy condition (another big disappointment!)
Since you are there, you should try their burger meal. The price was reasonable (900 yen) and the burger bread was cute.
Maybe we are spoiled by the theme parks on the Gold Coast, short queues (max 45min, even in school holiday), many character photo times, many different rides that suite different ages.

2765,Very good experience despite the crowd. Recommended attraction!,"Let's be fair in our reviews of this place, so here are the cons first.

I agree that this park is ridiculously crowded with majority the locals who probably own annual passes. My family & I visited on a Mon (supposedly a school day too), & it was really crowded (at least 10x more ppl compared to Disney HK IMO).

Queues were up to 150mins for major attractions & at least 30mins for smaller rides. Only managed to grab 1 Fastpass (no extra $ involved) for Pooh's Hunny Hut at around 9.45am & it was already for 4pm! I gave up trying for any more Fastpasses as the queue at Pooh's already took us 1/2 hr.

U'd even have problem finding seats at the food outlets, so crowded everywhere!

Souvenir items were extremely pricey but I guess this was comparable to other theme parks of this standard. All the shows were in Japanese.

U can forget about taking pictures with the characters especially Mickey & Minnie. The queues were just tooo long! Besides, the park is so big that the meet & greet areas were quite out of they way if you had already been passed earlier.

Ok, now for the pros!

The whole park is just Happiness personified! Once u step in, u are drowned in feel good songs, beautiful/colourful decors, and greetings & smiles from all the staff members. Even the cleaners & toilet attendants were extra cheerful & friendly.

Dont be put off by the crowd! Although there were long queues everywhere, they moved fast & u dont really feel the wait. A Q sign could be for 50mins, but in fact only 30mins was required. We arrived at the park at 9.00am, left at 6.00pm, & managed to cover the whole park & get on 8 rides/attractions. But we had to miss Monsters Inc! Some rides you could skip unless you're with kids, eg Snow White & Pinocchio.

The parades were nice, but the fireworks were just so-so (we saw this from Maihama train station after having dinner at Ikspiari).

F&B prices were reasonable, the Turkey leg fantastic! Pls pass on the caramel popcorn, a total let down & not worth the JPY300. One good thing at Disneyland Tokyo is that they dont check for F&B in your bags. We saw lots of the locals & tourists eating from their own bentos/containers. There were water fountains everywhere, u dont hv to spend on drinks at all.

Although attractions in Japanese, most of their staff members speak at least basic English & are extremely helpful.

The park was noticeably less crowded by 4pm (it gets dark earlier in winter). So if u wanna avoid queuing too long at the rides, this was a good time to get on those u missed earlier.

Overall still a very good experience & much recommended! Just go & have FUN!

Last tip: Try & visit both Disneyland & Disneysea. Both are so different & one of a kind, but yet offer similar fun & excitement. Its also cheaper to buy a 2-day pass for both.","Written January 2, 2014",4.0 of 5 bubbles

There really is something at Disneyland for all ages. The street vendors make amazing popcorn in dozens of flavors and the eateries are quite affordable. I didn't get to DisneySea, but from all accounts it is just as great.

Managed to get the kids on Buzz Lightyear twice (my son favorite), once each on it's a small world, peterpan, phillar magic, pinocchio, caroussel, dumbo, pooh's hunny hunt (cant' miss it!), cartoon spin, pirates of the caribbean, monster inc.

The staff here are awesome. They literally smile all day.

TIPS: If you are travelling with small kids who cannot get on the ride, tell the staff in front of that attraction that you want to do the parent swap and they will let one parent want in the front of the attraction with the kids while the other parent went in. And when the first parent came out, the staff will take the other parent through a secret back stage door and right to the ride (even faster than fast pass line).","Written December 18, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

2787,Feel like a child again!,"Definitely recommend to go about an hour or so before opening to queue.

Do some research before going and decide your fast pass strategy, which rides you want to take (in which order) and get your hands on a map prior if you can. Not all places that sell tickets have English maps so try to get it from your hotel or from any Disney ticketing area (there are several around the city) so you can have a proper look at the layout and do some notations.

Eat or bring along a good breakfast. I felt that most of the food was junk food. I was staying at the nearby Sheraton and could return for a proper meal but it is inconvenient for everyone else who isn't staying at the Disney hotels.

Wear comfy clothes and shoes. You are definitely going to stand for many hours on end so choose something cute and fashionable while comfy.

There are many water points around the park, usually near a washroom, and sometimes along the queues for rides too, so just bring a water bottle to fill.

Check what parades are on during your visit and the timings! The Japanese will wait in the designated areas in advance for a great view. It's a good chance to grab some food and chill on the ground. Bring a mat if you mind sitting on the floor. No standing allowed though - Fabulous rule that ensures everyone has a nice view.

Don't forget to take the time to just enjoy the wonderfully designed surroundings, and take many photos! The Japanese love to dress up to go to Disneyland. Just give in to the temptation, buy a hat of your favourite character and join the fun!

The popcorn bucket is something of a collector's item. Different areas have different designs so do some research to get the bucket you want with the flavour of popcorn you want. Refills are cheaper if you already have the buckets.

There was no queue jumping it was most orderly. Even when we queued for the parades everyone sat in their place, no one asked if their child could sit in-front of you, like we have experienced in every other Disneyland around the world. Pushchairs were not allowed, and had to be folded and put out of the way. The parades and shows were stunning. The queues for the characters, again was orderly, no one tried to push in. The whole of the park was clean, there was a sense of pride, there were enough members of staff picking up the litter but everyone I saw that accidentally dropped litter in a restaurant or fast food cafe picked it up.

Make sure you have your next FastPass in your pocket before joining a FastPass ride - we worked this out too late and missed two major attractions due to the 3 hour wait time! Oh, that's another thing, the wait times are ""Bang On"". If the sign says 180 minutes, then you'll be waiting 180 minutes. USE THE FASTPASS TO ITS FULL ADVANTAGE! With a FastPass you literally walk right to the front of the queue in a separate line and join in about 10m from the turn-styles - about 10 min wait.

We got $200 air fares with JetStar and ridiculously cheap accom on Wotif, our whole trip cost less than $1500AUD for 3 nights for two people including spending money and a few gifts. It is also very cheap to eat in Tokyo, don't listen to other reviews. Often, we'd go to the ""hole in the wall"" type restaurants and eat for $5AUD each - that's main, soup and green tea for 5 bucks! Tokyo is CHEAP and the attractions are amazing. I can honestly say, I couldn't fly to the Gold Coast and get into the theme Parks there for a 4 day trip for less than $700 each!

Tokyo Disney land have some kind of tickets for example all one day ticket, after 6pm o‚Äôclock ticket, 2 days with lodging ticket etc. I think this various kind of tickets are point of Tokyo Disney land‚Äôs popularity. Then we selected after6 ticket because of summer. We thought that it is too tired to play in Tokyo Disney land one all day in very hot summer! We arrived at Maihama station, and walked to Disney land. There is a train in Tokyo Disney resort but we can go on foot, too. Then entrance of Disney land, there were too long line! So many! So I recommend that you have to come too early than opening time. Open the entrance, we were admitted! In summer night, there are fireworks! I really want to watch this, but we were in the middle of queuing for other attraction. Sometimes, if you have a big luck, you can see fireworks from corkscrew! It will be very unforgettable memory. In the night, parade‚Äôs light are very bright and make us take some picture! I did too! If you love illumination, please come to the Tokyo Disney resort.

I went there accompanying daughters that were curious in getting to know the park.

The standards for Disney lovers are all kept... the attractions in the park as well as the fake Italian small villages or the Mexican pyramids...they are all there. The only difference is the amount of of Asian people, which is of course bigger than in US or Europe.

Truly, other parks have way more thrilling roller coasters or other tides, but the themes and the atmosphere here make the difference. I went in the middle of t he week thinking it would be less crowded, but I was shocked by the huge number of students, some off them with school uniforms. We used our share of fast passes, but eventually all rides were available for queuing. I don't recommend the haunted mansion since all the voices are in Japanese, there is nothing scary. Also captain EO 3D movie is very old (1985). Actually, I watched it back then and it was great, so leave it till the end. Try to reach there by 8:00 AM to utilize your fast passes. The park is nearly one hour from Shinagawa station. Use keihin Tohoku or Yamanote line to Tokyo station, then take the JR Odeo line to Maihama. The park is just by the station. When I was there I regretted I didn't try the sealand park. I didn't try the food so I can't tell how good it was. By the way, better wear comfortable shoes as there will be queuing for 2 hours in some rides.","Written October 29, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2803,"A lot of fun , a lot of queuing","We had a great time at Tokyo Disney with our 2 and 4 year olds. I was really expecting horrible crowds with all of the previous reviews, but thankfully it wasn't bad. That is probably because we went in October, mid-week, and it wasn't great weather outside. Most rides were about 20 mins. The bigger rides (space mountain, etc) were about 45 mins. Nothing was over an hour. The fast pass worked very well. You grab one in the morning for the ride you want and come back later. The Japanese people were very nice and the place was spotless. The parades and rides are well done, although everything is in Japanese, so my children didn't understand much. But they recognized all of the characters. Disney Sea was great as well. We got a three day pass and easily could have spent two days in both parks. I only wish they didn't force you to choose which parks you will visit when you bought the tickets. You can do one day at one park and two days at another park. We stayed at the hilton (separate review) nearby and that was definitely the way to go! Stay at one of the hotels nearby if you have children with you.","Written October 28, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Though it has certain similarities with HK, it has also lot of unique characteristics. As we had already done one DL, we did not rush through the day, but were selective with what we saw. Even then, one day was not enough. Thought the park was crowded, the crowds were well organized. There was no pushing or shoving at any point, though there was running for FP when the park opened. We went for FP for the rides we were extremely keen on, stood in queue for shorter ones in the first half and kept the rides where we couldn't get FP and were popular for evening. This way we managed to get on almost every ride we wanted, except Big Thunder Mountain, which developed technical difficulty after my daughter & husband had stood in queue for 90 minutes. But they got priority pass which they used for Buzz Lightyear which was another long wait. Loved the smoked turkey legs and the different flavoured churros.

There were many special parades to celebrate the 30th anniversary as well as many Disney products and merchandise to choose from to celebrate.

It was an amazing experience and we had a blast with trying all the different foods that aren't available in the United states. They have characters popping up everywhere and although most things are in Japanese they have a few things still in English.

Tokyo Disneyland wasn't as Princess-centric like in the USA and it was nice to see the excitement over original characters rather than the princesses.

Definitely pay the extra money to get a popcorn bucket! It's worth the refills and you can use the bucket every time you visit!! The buckets are a collectible type thing and the refills are cheaper and the flavors are awesome and eccentric. Especially curry popcorn!!!

Try to get their early and enjoy the whole day. Utilize the fastpasses for rides you really really want to do and try to manage your time. Also if you aren't overally interested in parades the lines for rides are shorter during the times they are going on.

Also they have cheaper tickets if you only want to go from like 3:30pm on or 6pm on.","Written October 11, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

2818,"Line up, Line Up!!","Let me start by saying I love Disneyland, but sadly I left Tokyo Disneyland feeling well and truly ripped off! We planned our travel to be out of the peak season, but the crowds were huge. We managed 1 ride when we first arrived with only a 20 minute wait time, but from there on the wait time was 2hours and 40 minutes for thunder mountain and the same for space mountain.
To get your moneys worth out of the entry price is impossible. Having been to California Disneyland and Disney World in Florida where at this time of year you can get on most rides with a 15 -30 minute wait I didn't expect Tokyo to be so much more crowded.
I think for us the final straw was lining up to use the rest room and around 5pm we headed back to out hotel very tired and let down after only 3 rides.
On the positive side, like all Disney theme parks it is a magical place that is just fun to be in, and everyone is so polite and friendly.","Written October 7, 2013",3.0 of 5 bubbles

2820,"Clean and Friendly, Crowded and Very Busy","Overall we enjoyed ourselves, but I would much rather visit Disneyland in California for many reasons, but the most is because of the crowds! If you go to Tokyo Disney on the weekend, it is way, way too busy. Even during the week it is busy. At least an hour to ride the major attractions. A few positives are that everybody their is friendly and helpful. In addition, as with other Disney parks, it is very clean and well taken care of. And surprisingly, it is not really that expensive for food and souvenirs, which I expected since it was Japan.
The downside though again is the crowds. Even if you do get the Fast Pass, you will not get to return until several hours later or maybe the evening time.
And finally, I was disappointed that there was not many characters around. To see Mickey Mouse, you had to wait in line for about 90 mins. Then the only other characters we saw all day were Captain Hook and Fairy Godmother walking around. In contrast, California's park you would see a minimum of 10 per day, including all the favorites like Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Cinderella, Tinkerbell etc.
Not sure I would go again. I would say this though, if you are going to go with little kids, the Fantasyland area seems less crowded than the others. Also, you can bring food and drinks into the park, which is very good way to save some money.","Written October 4, 2013",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2821,"30 years old -- but still clean, fresh and fun !","This Disneyland is still my pick of Disney's stable. It's now 30 years old -- but has lost none of its appeal. It is immaculately clean, as modern as tomorrow, and lots of fun.

Unfortunately, the crowds have increased dramatically over the 25 years since I last visited -- and the Waiting Times for the best rides can now be more than 100 minutes.

The Blue Bayou Caf√© was a great place for lunch -- and for easy access to very clean, well-maintained toilets with no queues !

My only criticism is that even at Disneyland which has lots of foreign tourists, and in the one ATM in the Disney Mitsui Bank branch -- no cash could be accessed via non-Japanese issued cards.

However the bank staff were very helpful and suggested that ATM machines in any Japanese Post Office would allow cash withdrawals using foreign issued cards.

In spite of not being able to get cash at Disneyland using my Australian-issued credit card -- the card was happily accepted for purchases in all outlets.","Written October 3, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2822,Avoid under any circumstances,"We have now been to Disneylands in Paris, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and now Tokyo as well as Epcot Center Miami. We have visited at least a dozen of other theme parks around the globe. This must have been the most crowded one BY FAR. We came on a Monday on the last day of September, I'm not familiar with school holidays in Japan, but I imagine, it was a school day. We thought we were smart having bought the tickets in advance and having avoided the first queue of at least an hour, I think if we hadn't, we might have opted for DisneySea next door. The first ride we came across was the Monsters Inc. one with a waiting time of 200 (!) minutes. As a Star Wars fan, I wanted to do the Star Tours ride, but that had a waiting time of 120 minutes, so we got Fast Pass tickets for that ride which was due 2 hours later at 12:30. We passed the time until then with mediocre rides, and wanted to get new Fast Pass tickets for the Monsters Inc ride, but behold: FP ticketing for that ride (and for the Buzz Lightyear one, and Space Mountain) had already ended! Mind you, the park was opened for another 9 3/4 hours! By the time we made it to the other side of the park, there were no FP tickets available for any rides.
All the attractive rides had a line of at least 90 minutes, and that did not change until the park was closed. Even the boring ones, like the Dumbo or the Merry-go-round, you know those, which you can find at your local fair for 2.50 EUR, had people queuing up for an hour.
They had a nice parade going on, at least from what we could make out, as we had been ushered away every time we had a good view. We haven't managed to find out the reason as English speaking personell was hard to come by.
Considering that admission for adults is 6200 Yen (about 46.50 EUR) and discounts are hardly available, spending 10 hours waiting in line for 3 good rides and maybe 4 mediocre ones is a costly way to spend your time.
If you are in Tokyo and you have to visit one of the Disney theme parks, I suggest you try DisneySea. However I strongly recommend going to Disneyland on another continent (most stuff is in Japanese anyway).

2823,Like Disneyland Hong Kong but wait times much longer,"We have two young sons and spent the morning at Disney Seas. Since it closed early we had the option to head to Disneyland for an extra 2,000 each so we took advantage of it. We left Disney Seas with the very short wait times and spent the evening at Disneyland waiting over one hour for the Dumbo ride. Other rides where worse with over 130 minute wait times and no fast pass available. The set up is pretty much like Disneyland Hong Kong. The food is just OK with nothing to eat from the street vendors but different flavored popcorns or the same freezy bars at each place. Ad of course, the are more stores and restaurants than entertainment options. After experiencing one Disneyland, I wasn't impressed. My 5 year old did like Toontown, there is only one ride in there and it is a coaster which he liked. Funny how that coaster is in with little kid stuff and the only people on it were adults. My son loved going through Donald's boat even though there wasn't a whole lot of interactive things.

If you don't have time for both, I would do Disney Seas as a nice change from the typical Disneyland experience. Disney Seas does seem to be geared towards the older kids but my 5 and 8 year old loved it (but they ready boys, not into princesses).","Written September 30, 2013",3.0 of 5 bubbles

2830,Familiar and fun,"We had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland, although it's much more crowded than California Disneyland mid-week in mid-September. (Think mid-July in California, that's an average day at Tokyo Disneyland). My husband prefers Tokyo Disneyland to California Disneyland; I prefer California. I do like the layout of Tokyo Disneyland better--it feels more open and easier to get around in. Perhaps because there's no Matterhorn and no Indiana Jones so there is literally more space. Also Japanese people are more orderly and polite than anyone else in the world, so that could have something to do with it.

The rides are pretty much the same as Disneyland in California, but Space Mountain felt a little slower and had no music. :( It was still fun, but music really makes a big difference. Splash Mountain was also a little different...You sit in pairs in the log rather than a single line (so there's less leg room) and you don't get nearly as wet...You will get splashed in your face if you're in the front, but that's the wettest you'll get. Single rider line is more enjoyable in California because you're not sitting next to anyone...I recommend fast pass or early standby on this instead of single rider so you can sit with your party. The standby line is 2-3 hours on a typical day mid-week in mid-September (not a holiday) after 12 pm...If you go on this ride first thing in the morning, standby is 40-60 min. All of the other rides here are pretty much the same as California Disneyland.

As with DisneySea, overall, the food was NOT impressive. Bring food from outside if you can. The Queen of Hearts Restaurant was not bad though. The detail of the restaurant is awesome and the food was pretty good--similar prices to a buffeteria at Disneyland in California, maybe a little pricier considering the smaller portion sizes though.

Tips: Get there early--no later than an hour after opening so you can get as many fastpasses as possible. The first day, we got in around 15 min after opening and the second day we got in around 45 min after opening...both days we got two fastpasses. Decide the three rides you want to do the most and have one member of the party run for fastpasses while the rest of your party goes to the other ride and gets in line. As soon as your first fastpass window opens up, go get fastpasses for the third ride you want to go on, and so on. Wouldn't recommend an after 6 pm ticket here unless you're just coming for the parade or a show or something.","Written September 21, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

In terms of getting there, you can get a bus. Beware that it can be hard to find someone who speaks English. Our bus took us to Disney Seaworld instead so we had to pay extra for a monorail to take us to Disneyland. However getting the bus was so relaxing when compared with trains and it was nice to have a bus ride home in the evening knowing we'd be dropped off in the right spot.

2839,"Great day out, just be prepared to queue","My wife and I went for a day out to Disneyland Tokyo and can honestly say we both loved it. This is particularly high praise given I'm not really into A) Disney or B) theme parks. Disneyland to theme to the max, even your chicken nuggets in the fast food cafes are shaped like Mickey Mouse!

As far as the rides go, please just get there early - especially on a weekend. Make sure you use the fast pass system, which effectively means you don't have to queue, but you can only 'fast pass' one ride at a time. As for the rest of the rides, get comfortable with queueing, the average waiting time at a weekend being around 2 hours or more for the more popular rides.

On the whole, Disneyland Tokyo is great, if you are in two minds whether you should give it a go, just do it, its tiring but you really won't be disappointed, especially if you have kids (or a wife who still thinks she is 12!). Enjoy - we certainly did.","Written September 11, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

If it gets to hot there was shows in air conditioned areas.","Written September 5, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2842,Disneyland was way better,"The park was interesting only because we were in Japan. Pros were the lines, even though longer than the states, went faster, clean, and like I've said before had different things to shop for than the ones in the US. Cons were most animated rides were in Japanese so you couldn't really understand what they were saying. food sold is all ala carte so if you buy a burger, fries and soda it could cost you close to $15. If you have a big family I suggest a snack during the day and the buffet for dinner. Also don't expect to get a lot of treats that the US offers. Mostly they had tons of different types of popcorn, waffles, Popsicles, and crepes. Except for the food souvenir store that had gift boxes of cookies. There's no refillable cups. So the day we went just happened to have a heat wave so I spent majority of our money buying bottles of water ($2) all day. Then only frontier town sold plain water so we had to walk back there every time we wanted water. All other vendors sold oolong tea and orange flavored water. One thing I did learn was that those refillable popcorn cases that you get at Disneyland works at all parks. So if you have one from the states you can use it here. The rides seem shorter too.
All in all it was interesting. Glad I went just to have that experience. Everyone was very nice and helpful especially when you don't know the language. I think though it was a one time thing for me.","Written September 4, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

We (2 chaperones) had 4 teenagers from North Vancouver, (Canada) and 4 from Chiba, (Japan) so our group of 10 had a wonderful day going on all the rides.

Pricing was surprising to say the least the cost to enter the park is about half of Disneyland in California and food costs inside the park have virtually no markup so that was a pleasant surprise.

If you live in Japan or have an extended stay the park is definitely worth going to prefferably off season and mid week to help with the crowd but if you have a short visit it isn't worth going unless Disneyland is the reason for your trip to Tokyo.","Written September 3, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

However we still had lots of fun here. The attractions, the rides, the shows were all amazing, but I would recommend to learn about the park before you go. So once you enter the park, you know already which rides you want to play first and go & get fast pass ticket immediately. Without the fast pass we have to queue for about 1.5 to 2 hours. It also happened when we wanted to have lunch at Queen of Heart Banquet, there was also a long queue.

2862,A little different than the US Disney locations...very crowded,"Since we live in Tokyo, we have been many times. Always super packed, of course you want to avoid the weekends and summer, especially Oban, the 2nd wk of August. You must get the fast passes early and you must show up when the park opens. The last hour before it closes, the lines decrease some. We have taken the train each time, but the kids get really tired if you stay until the end and the walk in the subway is super long, so it is best to drive if you can. Better yet, I would stay at the hotel. We usually eat the Blue Bayou restaurant but it books up really early, so if you want to eat there, eat during non- peak times. The Blue Bayou is fairly reasonable and the kids dish is served on a mickey plate. I highly recommend the seafood casserole dish. It is so crowded that it is a sea of people, almost shoulder to shoulder at times. The have a lot of unique popcorn flavors and food choices.","Written August 4, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2863,Like every other disney land but with huge crowds,"I was told to avoid the weekends because of the crowds, week day crowds was huge. I even woke up early before opening time, but turned out half of Tokyo had the same plan.

Some of the queues to ride were 2 hours long! There was even a 40 min queue for the fats pass machines. After 5 days at Disney we spent a total of 3 hours at the park, we got so fed up with the system ended up taking the train into Tokyo and explored the city instead. Disney sea is a bit more interesting as you have things at the park you don't see at other disney resorts. But again same problem with crowds.

If you are the sort that follow strict time tables etc then the fast pass system is for you, if you are the sort that just likes to do things on the spur of the moment then forget disney, there are so many more interesting things to do in Japan.","Written August 2, 2013",2.0 of 5 bubbles

My husband and I are both Disney fans, and it is a great day trip from Tokyo. All the attractions are good, and while I have motion sickness and can never got on a rotating / revolving ride or attractions, I really enjoyed myself. In case fellow sufferers are wondering, I didn't get sick even on the roller-coaster (though it did give me a headache). Don't miss the afternoon parade - it is much livelier and upbeat than the night one (the latter is more visually appealing but very mellow).

In any case, it is a legendary attraction and has many other attractions to keep everyone happy. Most of the shows were in Japanese, which was a bummer - we don't know the language - but still, it's worth it. The restaurants - too many to count! - were great, spread out in every ""zone"" and consistently served good food. The staff throughout the resort are very helpful and courteous, and the facilities are top notch.

I don't know what we would have done without the Fast pass option... we got a couple and it made just a difference (5 minutes wait instead of up to an hour)...It really is better to go there early in the morning... we went around noon, and in the heat - it was bloody hot in July, - it was quite tired standing in a queue everytime....

2866,Excellent day,"We went to Disneyland on a Tuesday just before the Japanese school holidays and although the place was definitely full of people, we didn‚Äôt really notice it. I was surprised that we never had to queue for food or the bathrooms. We took full advantage of the fast pass system and managed to go on Splash Mountain, Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain twice. We went on every other ride that was operating once (except for the Buzz Lightyear and Monsters Inc rides). The only ride not operating was Pinnochio. The longest ride queue we had was for Space Mountain (we didn‚Äôt use a fast pass the first time) and it only took 50 minutes.

We were very impressed with the ride lines. Although some lines were long, we were constantly moving or had something to look at. We did get annoyed at the number of teenagers cutting in line to join their friends though.

I highly recommend Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt. Even as a young couple in our early 20s with no children, we loved it.

We also found food to be quite reasonably priced as we were expecting to pay ridiculous theme park prices. Ice creams were 300 to 400 yen each. 800 to 1000 yen for a burger, chips and drink.","Written July 30, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

However, think twice before you sit on a bench 2 hours ahead of the parade and happen to be a foreigner. I was sitting on a bench with my brother and father, with 1 plastic bag full of souvenirs. As most of the stuff was glass, my father decided to put it on the bench before he headed off to the washroom. Turns out to be a big no no. One of the staff members saw that I was holding onto a green leaflet (the English version of the parade schedule) and asked if I was waiting for the parade. I said yes, then she started firing away in JAPANESE. Ok, if I understood Japanese, why would I need a translated leaflet? Turned out she wanted me to remove the bag from the bench, thinking I was occupying the entire bench for myself. Not wanting to waste more time trying to understand her Japanese, I did as she requested. Then my brother looked over and pointed over to another lady on a bench across from us, where she had the ENTIRE bench full of shopping bags with no one else sitting with her. So why was I asked to remove one single bag from the bench, when it was obvious that lady was hogging the entire bench for her friends? My father returned, heard what happened, then purposely put the bag on the bench again when my brother headed off to the washroom. The same staff member came over and this time, my father was determined to cause a commotion and asked her why she didn't pick on the lady across from us. She ignored our requests to get someone who could actually understand English and kept speaking in Japanese with an extremely rude tone. She then kept shoving a translated version of the ""park rules"" in our faces. We finally got the attention of her supervisor and apparently she didn't even understand the rules herself. She automatically assumed we were hogging the entire bench, not allowing anyone else to sit down, just because of the plastic bag. The bench was for four people and we had three. And the rules clearly state we are allowed to occupy the bench as long as our entire party returned in time for the parade. We even invited someone who couldn't find a seat to sit with us in the end. What about the lady on the bench across from us? Three people in total and a bunch of bags on the bench. Another lady on the bench next to ours actually occupied an entire bench and the space in front of her with two beach mats. If that isn't double standards, I don't know what is. A bit racist too. If this is how tourists are treated at Tokyo Disneyland, it's hardly the ""happiness"" they keep advertising at all. Her supervisor apologized, told us we were right about the rules and got her out of the area for the entire parade (she never apologized herself). I'm still looking for an email address to send my complaints to and won't be returning.","Written July 21, 2013",1.0 of 5 bubbles

If we did not have pre purchased tickets I think we would have turned around. However, the lines moved very fast and once inside the park is huge. We headed to our number 1 ride and joined the queue as well as getting fast tickets for a later time. We managed to get 5 fast ride tickets throughout the day and they were totally worth getting. We found the queues to be reasonable with most wait times around the 40 minute mark. We didn't watch much of the parade, instead used this time to get onto rides that basically become deserted. In most cases there wasn't even a line. Food is very average inside and finding water is near impossible. The turkey leg was delicious but most other stuff was crap.

2874,If only it was less busy,"Travelled half way round the world to visit this park. As other people have said it was quiet walking up to get tickets and to get in, but then inside the volume of people is unbelievable. We ended up walking right round the park just looking for a ride that didn't have a line over one hour and that didn't mean waiting in direct sunlight. Nothing. We managed to get a fast pass for Splash mountain to return at 4pm. This was at 9:30am, and all the other fast pass tickets were finished. We eventually did Pirates of Caribean (30mins wait with a bit of it outside) and then a 80 min wait for Big Thunder Mountain (it had just reopened after a break down).
Went back to hotel for a swim and went back late afternoon for Slash Mountain.
There was a thunderstorm which meant everyone went undercover, so we were able to get on a couple more rides once the rain stopped.
Very disappointed to have come all that way and hardly got on any rides.
Went back 2 days later and was there at opening time. Lines are massive, but it means you can get a fast pass for the popular rides.
It was a bit quieter as it was a week day. 40min waits were now average, although some were still 80mins.
I have now been to all the Disney parks around the world. This was by far the busiest and had the longest lines. The lines for food were huge and they sit down waiting for shows in incredible heat, hours before they start.

Tips: be there for opening to get a fast pass ticket and then get on another good ride.
Stay at a hotel nearby so that you can go back to hotel during the day and go back to park at night when it's a bit quieter. (We stayed at Hilton Tokyo Bay)
Avoid weekends and public holidays.
Get a 3 day pass. You won't get round all the rides in a day. It's just too busy.
You can pay a LOT extra for a guide who can get you in fast pass lane of all the rides, but it seems to only be available for Japanese speaking guests. This is not very well advertised and must be booked in advance.

2875,An amusement park for line waiting,"We arrived at the park fairly early at 10am. Seemed quite slow when we walked up to the gates and excitedly thought we would be able to get quite a few rides and lunch in...

Unfortunately it was quite the opposite. We were at the park for 9 hours and we just managed to squeeze in 4 rides and lunch. Minimum wait on a ride was 100 mins. Fast Passes were all sold out by the time we arrived.

The wait for lunch was even 90 minutes. We tried to get some snacks instead from the carts, those were all 30 mins. Want a bottle of water from a vending machine. 15 minute wait and a massive line.

We tried to buy a few things from the gift shop and a cast member told us it was a 30 minute line to pay for your item at the registers.

An overwhelming majority of the Japanese people there didnt seem to mind. Everyone was all smiles in all of the lines. But when you spend 90% of your day just waiting around - it sort of sucks the fun out if everything. We consider ourselves to be quite easygoing people, but this day was stressful.

Side note for vegetarians : there is only one place at the park that has one dish that is vegetarian. The pasta w vegetables at East Side Cafe. Everything else in the park has meat. Apparently you are allowed to bring in your own food if you are veg.","Written July 14, 2013",2.0 of 5 bubbles

In July there are two parades. The first one is tanabata (only 3 minutes) and the second is the regular one in the afternoon.

2878,Where dreams really do come true..,"I had extremely high expectations for Tokyo Disneyland and they were nearly all met - most exceeded.

We visited on a Wednesday, and whilst it was crowded, we still managed to get on a couple of rides. I recommend utilising the fast pass option as soon as you arrive at the park, otherwise you may miss out on some of the more popular attractions.

All the attractions are done very well, so too is the night parade - so definitely stay for this if you can!

Whilst there are several gift shops (including one outside the park) I was disappointed with the selection. I also think the park could benefit from showcasing some Disney history - which the park currently lacks.

Was also disappointed by the lack of character meet and greets, and the fact they did not make their way around the park for photos. I assumed, like most theme parks, character would be greeting guests throughout the day.

Lots of staff, who are all extremely friendly and smile with every word. They try very hard with English and can speak enough of it to suffice.

But it was awful :( And its all because of the crowds.

Yes, we went on a Sunday, and the weather was good. But it wasn't school holidays or any kind of holiday season for tourists.. And it was still packed.

The thing is when you first walk in, it doesn't seem that bad. Its such a massive place, everything seems not too busy. But it was so bad.

Firstly Space Mountain was closed. And with the other more 'adult' rides, the minimum wait we saw was 150 minutes.... That is 2 and a half hours to wait for a 4 minute ride!!!

The crazy thing is, the Japanese are all happy to wait! It was unbelievable. The most surprising thing I saw was at around 12pm, I noticed all of these people sitting in the middle of the street, all in a line. Not a huge amount, but enough to make me look and think ""what are they doing?"". And then I realised. They were getting themselves in position for the 3.00 parade!! It was still 3 hours away !!! I honestly was stunned.

It really wasn't worth staying and we actually left after 2 hours of just wandering around. Going to Disneyland Tokyo wasn't a big thing on our agenda, but we thought it would be something fun to do. But it was very disappointing.

Getting there is super easy though. As a tourist from outside of Japan, you can use the JR pass as there is a JR line that goes all the way there.","Written July 5, 2013",1.0 of 5 bubbles
2880,Better than US Disney,"Having been to the Florida Disney a few years ago with my kids I was highly reluctant to go again, in fact i vowed never to go near such a place again - but succumbed under duress. Actually it wasn't that bad, much better than the US version, cleaner and newer. We went on a Thursday and the queues were fine, we had a bit of a wait to get on the Star Tours (best ride there), but otherwise didn't have to wait too long. We didn't even bother with fast passes. So all in all I took it for the team survived. Hopefully that means I will never have to go again...","Written July 4, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2881,Much Better Than Expect,"After reading reviews, I was worried, but we had a fantastic day. We went on a Tuesday that was hot, so maybe there were less people (certainly the barriers in place for the queues suggested as such). First, the place is incredibly clean. Secondly, the food was much better than people suggested. Thirdly, if you use the fastpass properly, you can get a few rides done very quickly. Yes, you will need to standby on a couple, but what are people expecting, its a major theme park. The rides were brilliant and worth the wait. Add the excellent parade, and we had a great time, and my 9 year old son reckoned it was one of his best days. The only negative is that I don't think I could go to another theme park, as its hard to see how this experience can be bettered.","Written July 3, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2882,Well worth it,"Had a fantastic day at Disneyland Tokyo. I would recommend buying the tickets beforehand to avoid one of the many queues and also avoiding weekends as they are reportedly uber busy. I got a slight discount (5500 yen each instead of 6300 yen) from buying it a nearby convenience store.

I went with my girlfriend on a Friday and turned up roughly half an hour early which helped avoid a bit of the queue to enter. The queues would vary with the big ones being mostly between 30 and 60 minutes. When I saw queue times of greater than that I would just move on to something else and come back later.

Also making use the the fast pass system early on really helps. (Free tickets to jump some of the queue that everyone can get a limited number of but are limited to getting one every few hours. They can be found near most of the major attractions - ask the staff if you can't find them). Note they do run out over the course of the day so start early!

The rides themselves were fantastic with amazingly detailed animatronic characers and a wide variety of ride intensities for differing tastes. The Monsters Inc and Winnie the Pooh rides were particularly good and had lines to reflect this (both 75 minutes plus) however I went to them late in the day and queued for a relatively painless 40 and 15 minutes respectively.
Philharmagic was also a rather impressive multisensory cinema show.

I would not recommend seeing Captain EO unless you are a big Michael Jackson fan or very nostalgic for the 80s esthetic which this film screams. MJ can dance but he can't act for toffee, and his many ugly puppet costars are charmless, annoying and stupid, looking like a particularly ham fisted attempted by George Lucas to sell tat to young children. The whole thing feels like a bloated, expensive extended music video/vanity project.
Maybe you could enjoy this if your shick is seeing movies that are 'so bad they're good' but even then it is a waste of limited time that could be spent elsewhere in disneyland.
My GF slept for the duration, I was not so lucky.

All in all one I felt one day was enough, having managed to check out pretty much all of the big attractions and a few of the lesser ones too, although two days would allow you to be in less of a rush and see more/repeat the ones you like. All in all it was a real pleasure that I would recommend to anyone.

I have been told that if you like this you should try disney sea as it is reportedly very similar but with the addition of alcohol being permitted!","Written July 3, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2883,Always a fan of Disneyland,"A lot of reviews much have mentioned that the wait is ridiculous for each ride here.

Well, we went on a Monday and a non-school holiday so although it was crowded, it wasn't that long a wait say 50-60 mins, as shared, per ride. Not sure if we were lucky. We did go against the usual flow of starting the park with Adventureland instead of Tomorrowland.

But the wait was mostly between 10-30 mins per ride at most. Tho I must admit the longest one was worth the wait indeed 70 mins - a photo with Mickey Mouse at his home in Toontown and Monster Inc. Otherwise, we have actually managed rides which took us less than 7 mins wait.

We certainly enjoyed ourselves there and stayed til 10 pm it's closing time. But yeah we intentionally missed some rides especially in Toontown cos it's a little too kiddy for our children. The achievement was to cover at least 80-90 % of Tokyo Disneyland reputed for it's crowd.

And overall, it's a great experience still.

Tips : If you miss the first round, you can meet Mickey and Minnie at the entrance at 11.55 am near the park's entrance. Also, do not delay getting out of Disneyland after closing time as the last train leaves Maihama not long after.

Enjoy Disney!!!","Written July 1, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2884,For the young and young at heart,"We had a great day at Tokyo Disneyland. You can't not have a good day here. There is just something 'Magical' about the place. All of the staff are beyond friendly, they just go out of their way to 'make' the experience. It's exceptionally clean, has reasonably (theme-park) priced food and snacks, and just small enough to do in one day (2 days if you want to do the DisneySea bit, which we didn't). Family friendly, with the Log Ride and Splash Mountain being the only 2 real 'thrill' rides- but they are definitely fun and popular! Get a Fast Pass for these ones, well worth the wait of ~ 2-4hrs+ each!

Oh, and about those fast passes, you can only have one (1) at a time! So get there early, pick your 'must-do' rides, grab a fastpass from the machine (next to the ride queue) for the next available- then as soon as you have done that one, get the pass for the next one and so on. The time in between can be spent on other, smaller/shorter wait rides. :)

Free (included) travel on the JR Keiyo/Chuo lines, via Tokyo Station to Maihama (Disneyland)- allow at least 20mins each way. Definitely recommend buying a pre-paid day entry pass in advance, and go on a weekday to avoid the long lines!","Written July 1, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2885,Fun day at one of the Best Disneys,"It is very easy to reach Tokyo Disneyland by train. From Tokyo station, take the JR Keiyo line and get off at Maihama. If in Shinjuku area, take the JR Chou line to Tokyo station and connect with the Keiyo line. If you have a JR Rail Pass (highly recommended) then these trips are free, covered by the pass. In my opinion this is one of the best Disney parks that I have visited. There are 2 areas to the park, the DisneySea park and of course Disneyland park. On the day we were there, they were offering senior tickets to anyone over 40 years old, I think to celebrate there 30th anniversary. Adult ticket prices 6,200 Yen, senior 5,500 Yen. The park is large but well layed out in a huge circle shape so going from one area to the next will literally bring you around and back to the front gate. We arrived early and had ease in moving around the park, including rides and events. There were no extraordinary long lines until middle afternoon when many school groups showed up. The restaurants were not overpriced, and we ate at Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall. Cafeteria style but basic selections all fresh and served to you by friendly and helpful staff. Every employee we came in contact with, from ticket counter to people at the rides and in the parades exuded an exciting and friendly attitude, and it certainly made for an enjoyable day. The park was very clean, the grounds were immaculate, with an abundance of flowers, manicured grass and trees. The restrooms (toilets) were very clean and well maintained. There were 2 parades, one at mid day and the Electrical Night parade after dark. I have been to Tokyo Hong Kong which is very good also, but Tokyo is much larger, more room to move around with the large crowds and more eating options. Beware of the souvenir shops. They were packed with so many people, it was difficult to even browse, not to mention buy something. Not sure why, the prices were outrageous. A fun day for the entire family.","Written June 30, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2886,5 hours queuing? no way!,"Oh what a waste! We arrived around 11am and left around 5pm on late March. It was raining both days (Disneyland and Disney Sea) but the worse came when we wanted to do the rides. There were just a few of them which had still fast track but take a ticket to do the ride 7 or 8 hours after?, that means you have to stay the whole day only for one ride!. If you want to have another ride chances are that you might not get the fast track ticket because it's over, so you have to queue between 3 and 5 hours, meaning that your day is gone on the line for a single ride.

Food is t e r r i b l e!!!!!! not even the beautiful turkey legs are good. We went to Disney Sea the day after but this time we took our own food which we loved.

I've been in Disney Orlando, L.A. and Hong Kong and this is the worse. We didn't enjoy it at all and thought it was a waste of time as there is absolutely nothing good about this park. Have I mentioned the shops? the only things you find there is the Duffy Bear, not nice clothes or magnets or caps, nothing!","Written June 27, 2013",2.0 of 5 bubbles

2888,It's great to walk in a childs shoes again,"Initially I was put off visiting tokyo Disney but the multitude of reviews saying this is one of the busiest theme parks in the world ; The queues are out of control and the heat is terrible. So it was fair to say that we were definitely skeptical about whether or not we should take the risk with our 2.5 year old and 9mth old and step through those turnstiles. I mean honestly would you do it when your toddler resembles something of an out of control labrador on speed chasing a squeaky toy in a sea of Japanese children who seem to sit like dosile 20 year old well trained Poodles? I say no....

However our hotel heavily marketed the park and offered a free bus too and from the facility which would save a train ride. Now we are pretty good with trains and have managed to get around all over the world however refer back to 2.5 year old speed driven lab comment and envision said child swinging from the suspended handles after a day full of excitement and sugar.... Nightmare.

When we arrived the park had been open for an hour so there were no queues upon entry (an excellent sign!) the park is currently decked out in its 30th anniversary theme and one you enter the park a feeling of childlike wonderment and happiness swarms over you like happy little tinkerbells. Clearly a strong marketing team has designed Disney and u walk straight into a plethora of gift stalls which you initially say why the hell would anyone want this crap.....I mean really a Minnie Mouse sundress? (Watch this space) but you are struck by the fact everyone is wearing some sort of Disney headress and suddenly the urgency to fit in takes over and before you know it you are adorned in Micky ears, goofy hat and said Minnie sundress.

This is the cleanest theme park I have ever been to. The toilets? Immaculate. The grounds? Not a blade of grass out of place (my toddler tried to scale a fence at one stage to play on the grass it was that nice.). I'm not sure if it was the day we went (Wednesday in off peak season) or the fact we only stayed in the childrens section (magic kingdom and toontown) but the longest we waited for a ride all day was 20mins. This was perfectly acceptable to me and as such we had an amazing day. Teacups rides, dumbo rides and a somewhat disturbingly scary Snow White ride were had by all (even the 9mth old went on everything which I found hilarious).

Worth noting - the roller coaster in toontown has height restrictions - my 2.5 year old met this restriction but wasn't allowed on as she wasn't three - we snuck back later (coz hey who wouldn't remember the family of four white people with blonde haired blue eyed children in central japan) and said she was three and got on - absolutely loved it so remember to say your child is three!!

I would also like to note that if ur children do stick out (as mine did like a pair chuck Taylor cons in a louboutin boutique) be prepared to make them shine for the day. They will be photographed and posed with more than the Jolie-Pitt brood on a field trip. In fact at one stage the queue for pictures with my girls was longer than that of goofy and Pluto!

2892,Better Late than never- reliving my childhood!,"2 weeks ago I went with an adult friend to Tokyo Disneyland. This was my first experience of a Disneyland anywhere in the world and I absolutely loved it. I had read the earlier reviews about the enormous ques and yes, they are a drag and do diminish the experience. Were it not for the ques I would have rated Disneyland a 5. However with some forward planning you can reduce your que times significantly on several popular rides. We reviewed the maps and attractions before we went and all this information is easily accessible on the website in English. We also knew from reviewing other traveller's reviews which rides are the most popular. So when we got there at 8:30 am when the doors opened, we raced to the most popular ride and got a ""fast pass"". Fast pass tickets are available at the location of the ride/attraction from a machine by scanning the barcode of your ticket . It will provide you with an allocated timeframe/slot to come back and go on the ride without having to que. These are VERY worthwhile but unfortunately you can only get 1 fast pass at a time. ie you wont get issued a second fast pass until you have used the one you have. So go to you fave ride and get a fastpass. In the meantime as you wait for that time slot go to another attraction and que. Some ques for the less popular rides are much shorter. The bad news is that the number of fast passes for each popular ride is limited and run out by mid morning (ie because all the time slots for the entire day get issued)- you may for example get a fast pass asking you to come back between 6:30-7:30pm at night that you obtained in the morning! The rides for which the fast passes are issued are marked on the attractions map and the most popular rides for which you need to try and get a fastpass are Space Mountain, Star Tours, Poo's Honey Pot. If you are really organised and prepared to que, you can get on a lot of rides if you go on a weekday that is not a holiday. We went on a Thursday and went on over 12 attractions but it was a fall day and we left at 9:45pm.

My favourite attractions were Ghost Mansion, Pirates of The Caribbean, Its a Small World and Space Mountain although the latter was probably the one that I would least recommend for kids or those who get queasy on rides as you are essentially on a rollercoaster with lots of twists and turns and it is all happening in the dark.

The people are polite, the park is so clean and there are heaps of restaurants and food stalls. I disagree with other travellers' reviews that the food is bad. We bought snacks to eat when queing for rides and also ate lunch and dinner and felt the food was fine (other than the coffee!). Do yourself a favour and try the curry popcorn- i will never eat plain popcorn again!

There are heaps of shops to buy merchandise within Disneyland and you will be surprised by how many Japanese adults there are walking around in Disney clothing and accessories. Many go all out including the guys! People watching is part of the fun! Also try and stay for the night parade as that was excellent- lots of floats lit up with lights- magical! As for the other shows, you need to go to a lottery system booth and scan you ticket to see if you will be issued with a ticket to see one of the shows. We lucked out and I have to say that was the moment when Disneyland was about unhappiness for us! We were pretty disappointed but just got on with getting on rides and watching the daytime parade and seeing the brass band performance on the street. Tickets to Disneyland are available in advance from Lawson Convenience stores and the ticket prices includes access to all the rides. Disneyland is accessible by train but we drove and parking cost 2000 yen for the day. Outside the complex are heaps of hotels and a big shopping centre but we didn't have time to visit them!

2893,Disneyland Tokyo - Where queues never cease,"Brought my kids here, expecting the same thing as Disneyland Hong Kong. Was totally wrong. Had managed to spend a whole day in Disneyland HK taking in most of the rides without any problems few years ago. However, here it was terrible.

Expect to queue for hours on end here. We came in early but all the good rides showed 150 - 200 minutes waiting time. Not sure if we had made a mistake by coming during the weekend but our guide said that even weekdays are also packed.

The long queue just spoils the mood but have to respect the locals whom seem not to notice the queues. A true test of patience for me and the kids, with them wailing, how much longer...","Written June 1, 2013",2.0 of 5 bubbles
2894,Unbelievable Place to Visit,"Okay it's Japan, but even with the language barrier this place was so enjoyable. I was pretty skeptical after reading the reviews about long lines and crowds. With that in mind my friend and I decided well hopefully we'll get onto at least 2 rides and just enjoy the park the rest of the day. But soon those myths would just be just myths and we ended up going on many more rides.

First, the people in Japan take Disney to a new level. What we noticed was people were willing to wait for hours for the park to open (and that's no joke!) What we noticed is that the park opened at 8:30, and the parking lot opened at 5:30am! The cars were coming in one after the other. So you want to know how to plan your day. Well here's ours. Because we were staying on sight we would get to enter the park a whole 15mins prior to the general public (not much). We went to stand in line about 1 hour before opening. The people who were already in line were orderly and patient. So don't worry about pushing. There were around 8 lines so the line we stood made us about the 6th to enter.

Second, plan where you want to go ahead of time, you can download the English version of the park and where the rides are located. What we decided was to hit Tomorrowland first, and choose the ride we want to be on. We choose Monsters Inc. Once we finished the ride we went and got a fastpass to Buzz Lightyear, and had my friends mom and Aunt head off to Fantasyland to go onto the Pooh' Hunny Hut and to catch Mickey's Philharmagic (they are in their late 70's). Since the line was getting long for Star Tours we decided to pass and catch up with her family. Pooh's Hunny Hut is a must! We then decided to ride the rides in Fantasyland and enjoy ourselves and ride whatever rides were moving until it was time to return for our fastpass time. We did the Buzz Lightyear ride, and then went and got another fastpass to another ride. Remember once the time has passed, you can get another one.

What we learned in our short time there was that the Japanese people will ride any ride no matter what the age. It didn't matter if they had children or not. And what we did was just that. Yes, the lines can and will be long, but if you plan your day right you can get on almost any ride with very little wait. There were lines that were showing a 70 minutes wait but we didn't care.

My advice is to go in there with an open mind. Yeah, you're not going to get onto every single ride you wanted to get on, but hey, plan, plan and plan again. If you go in with an idea of what you want, you will get to do more rides than you expected. I remember the wait at Disney World was just as bad. The best part was that we were staying on site so we were able to take a break and come back again to enjoy the rest of the park. We got onto many rides and enjoyed every minute.

As for the park, it is very clean, and the workers were cordial and helpful. Make to doubt about it we will be going back again.","Written June 1, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2895,Worth it but only just,"This was my first (and possibly last) trip to a Disney park. We went at end of May so Golden Week holiday had passed and it was before rainy/summer season started which is supposedly a 'quieter' time. In reality, I don't think there is a quiet time or if this was it then I can't imagine it at peak time because it was packed with 2-3 hour queues for all the prime rides. We got a fastpass ticket for the Star Wars ride at 10am which meant we had to return at 8.30pm to skip the first part of the queue (we still queued for about 15mins). We tried to get fastpass for the Monsters Inc ride next to it but it only offered tickets around same time as our Star Wars one so it wouldn't give us one. All other rides had no more fastpass tickets available so you either run in there at 8am and get fastpass for your favourites or be prepared to queue and manage about 5-6 rides a day. The shortest queues without a fastpass were around 40mins. The food is awful in there though that's pretty much what I was expecting. The rides are good when you do manage to get on them, the new Star Wars one being a personal highlight. My daughter loved the Monsters Inc ride though she did have to wait till 9.50pm to do it which was quite tough for a 4 year old. We also enjoyed the night parade.","Written May 30, 2013",3.0 of 5 bubbles

2899,"Queue, Queue, Queue & More Queue","I think this is should not be called Tokyo Disneyland. They should consider renaming it to Disney Sham. To shorten my review, I will just list down what I liked and disliked.

Like:
- Clean place
- Staff had great attitude and friendly
- the parade was quite spectacular
- very cheap entrance, it is only about USD 60 (6200 Yen) and if you get a 2 day pass, it is only 10,700 yen

Dislike:
- over crowded. I was advised by the hotel staff that 22 May 13 (Wed) was a super low season, but when I was there, I was simply overwhelmed by the enormous crowd. I just could not imagine what it would be like if it was a high season.
- the loooong queue if you want to do a ride. Fastpasses were quickly depleted by 2 pm for some rides.For one ride, even if you can get a Fastpass at 11.15 am, the time to return for the ride was 6.55 pm. It is almost an 8 hour wait. Pl do not be encouraged by other reviews stating that they were able to do certain popular rides several times, this is just NOT possible. Some rides had queue waiitng time of at least 50 mins while the popular ones 150 to 170 mins.
- food quality mediocre at best

If you intend to do the rides, then this park will sure disappoint. If standing for hours and hours in the queue is your kind of thing, then you will love Tokyo Disneyland. I left after doing 2 rides as I think there are plenty of other things to do than to wastetime standing in the queue.

Tips: apply sunblock or bring an umbrella as the queue areas beyond 30 mins waiting time are mostly not sheltered. So if the queue is 3 hours long, you will be standing in the sun for 2.5 hours.","Written May 24, 2013",1.0 of 5 bubbles

2901,Quality Entertainment,"We went there at around lunch time - which is not good... If your'e planning to experience all the rides & the shows, be there at around 8am as the average waiting time is around 30-45 minutes per ride...Front gate personnels don't have an english Disney Land Guide Map unlike Disney Sea. The park is well maintained - no garbages, smokers have their own stations & the people (Japanese) are very disciplined - no one will get ahead of you in line, they won't stand up at the middle of a show etc etc.. We also went to Star Trek tours - a new ride/attraction in disneyland which opened last May 7 (we went there on May 10). The queue's too long, you have to wait for 2hrs or more (this is usually the case for newly opened rides)..even the FASTPASS IS NOT THAT FAST - we got our FP tickets at around lunch, the FP ticket time was at 7-8pm just to ride this one. The effects/place was really impressive & there were moving R2d2 & C-3PO which is kinda cool even if you're not a star wars fan. The only downside overall is that all shows are in Japanese language - which makes some of the shows, well, a little boring cause you can't understand a single thing :( We also had the chance to see (reserved seating) One Man's Dream (stage performance) & the stage effects, props, choreography are really amazing - it compensates for the language barrier...lol!

2902,"Another Disney, another Continent","I have visited Disney in Florida and Disney near Paris, both times with my kids. This time it was Disney , Tokyo with my Grandson and his Mum. On the face of it, they were all very similar with the same attractions. Disney Tokyo is on a smaller site. The good news was shorter walking between rides, the bad is the queues seemed much longer. Maybe it was just very busy, but judging by the car park and what I have been told, this was a quiet Friday! I suppose I should also say that my grandson is only 2 1/2 years old and in all honesty 2 years too young. Don't get me wrong he loved it especially the electric parade, but queuing for 40 minutes is really too much to ask of him. The Disney theme continues to endure and it's pretty much a standard product. This was a shame because Tokyo could have been more Japanese and less American and been the better for it. The food was US and not up to standard. Take your own and save a fortune, as many Japanese visitors did. To really get the best from Disney you need to plan carefully. Start EARLY and hit the most popular rides while the queue is short. Lunchtime people are eating so eat earl (or late) and make the most of the slack time. Don't take your own buggy, hire one. Though expensive it's still a fantastic day you will never forget whatever age you are. Finally one strange thing about Tokyo is the number of unaccompanied adults. It seems no matter how old we all enjoy the magic, just glad I had my grandson to superviseüòé","Written May 18, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2903,Disney style with Japanese substance,"I visited here back in 1996 and a lot has changed since then. A monorail has appeared, several hotels and a whole new park 'Disneysea'. I have fond memories of this park as it was actually the first one I ever visited. I still think it probably has the best 'Castle' of any of the 'Magic Kingdom' parks.

Ride wise it has Space and Splash mountains, the haunted house, Pirates of the Caribbean, Winnie the Pooh, Big thunder mountain and a few other ones. Space mountain, out of all the worlds non-inverting one's I reckon this one is by far the best, it's in total darkness where as some of the others leak a lot of light. Winnie the Pooh is also different from other versions and is technologically very advanced. Haunted house and other rides are pretty identical to other world versions. 'It's a small world' is just as irritating here as it is anywhere else.

What sets this park apart though is the parades and the shear attention to detail. Can you imagine being in a USA park and everyone sitting down nicely when told to do so? We were sat about 15 feet from the rope yet still had a great view as everyone was just so well behaved. You have the feeling that if someone stood up at the wrong time an impeccable dressed employee would develop a Samurai sword from nowhere and a head would roll. Coming from the west it's just very different but it's beautiful to be a part of and appreciate it all. The attention to detail is stunning in all aspects, be it the parade or even just the servers in a 'Churro' truck. You will not find an employee that can't speak at least two languages and all were very forgiving and understanding of my very bad Japanese pronunciation (although I get the feeling that they do appreciate the effort, even if they do confirm what you've asked for in English). We experienced impeccable service and politeness during our entire stay. If you get the opportunity to come here, do, you will not regret the experience. It contains nothing really new if you've experienced the other parks in the world, but the people do separate this one apart.","Written May 17, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2904,When you wish upon a star...,"In April 2013, we visited Disneyland Tokyo for the first time. As expected, most of the attractions are quite similar with the one in Paris. But the most challenging (and quite annoying part) is that they are using Japanese in most of the attractions. So if you are not native speakers or fluent in Japanese, maybe you won't be really enjoying much.

Apart from the language barrier, you may not see any unique collections of souvenirs as you can find easily in Paris. They are very standard items such as clothings, toys, stationeries etc.

Since we went there during weekdays, the queue was not so long. In average, we could 'enjoy' around 40 minutes of waiting time.

Overall we are still satisfied with our visit to Disneyland Tokyo, as it's one of our favourite places. We surely come back again in the future.","Written May 7, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2905,Disney level quality with Japanese attention to detail!,"Having visited both Disneyland and Disney World in the U.S., I had high hopes for this park. I was not disappointed. Remember this is like Disneyland, in that it is only the Magic Kingdom with its different 'lands' (Tomorrowland, etc). The park is immaculate and has all the feel and magic that Disneyland should. This is its 30th year, so all merchandise is labeled as such. The Japanese LOVE their Disney products!

My daughter just turned three, and this was her first Disney experience. I think we were more excited than she was however!

Most employees spoke very good English and were very good at answering questions regarding parade times, etc. I think that the employees here are more attentive and 'magical' than their U.S. counterparts...which says a lot because they are all very good. When it came time for parades, they were very good at marshaling off the areas and keeping order. They have areas a certain distance from the ropes that are for sitting only, to ensure everyone can see. After that, it is standing only. The parades are long and very spectacular! Especially the night time electrical parade! Also noteworthy is the stroller parking. You leave the stroller outside of the attraction. Employees keep the area tidy and there is no fear of theft whatsoever.

Perhaps my memory of the U.S. parks is failing me, but it seemed that here in Tokyo, many of the rides (Snow White, Roger Rabbit, etc) were a bit too scary for young children. They were pretty intense and 'dark' which scared the bejezzus out of my toddler.

The food was fantastic and actually reasonably priced. The park itself was 6200Y ($68 UDS) per adult. It was well worth it and I would go back again! This is an all-day affair!

To get here by the trains, take the JR Yamanote Line (or metro) to Tokyo station. From there, transfer to JR Keiyo Line to the Maihama station. The park entrance is a short walk from the train station. After walking off of the pedestrian bridge, stay to the right and you will see the ticket booths.","Written May 5, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

2907,Wonderful day out!,"My husband and our two adult daughters (aged 30 and 32) spent an absolutely fantastic day at Disneyland. It was certainly a full day. We arrived at Disneyland at about 8.30am and did not have to queue very long for tickets, so we were in the park just after 9 and did not leave until just after closing time (10pm). I am sure that if the park had been open until later our daughters would have had us there even longer as we were all having such a good time.

We went on a Tuesday and were pleasantly surprised at the length of the queues. The longest we had to queue up for was about 30mins. Our usual wait was only 15-20mins and there were many times when it was even shorter than this. We did make use of the Fast Pass system twice. We did all of the rides that we wanted to (and that was most of them) and many rides multiple times, e.g. we did the Splash Mountain ride 3 times.

As other reviewers have commented it is a very clean park (just like the rest of Japan really) and the rides are fantastic. Our favourites would have to be Splash Mountain and the Winnie the Pooh ride (how those cars work is fascinating).

As has also been mentioned one of the best times to ride is while the parades are on as the queues are much shorter. At these times we could often just walk up to rides. We still saw a fair bit of the night parade because we went on rides near and/or overlooking the parade.

Overall, a fantastic day out and a real highlight of our trip to Japan.","Written April 30, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

There's too many people. We were travelling with small children and we can only allocate our visit to Disneyland on Saturday.

However Disneyland is still in our heart at its best. I have been to Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea several times and I love it in each visits.

My advice is do go to Disneyland during weekdays and avoid during any public holidays, Golden Week holidays, Obon Holidays and new Year holidays to enjoy the rides. If not, the queu will be like 100mins, 120mins and you have to run to get the special express pass when the Disneyland gates open.","Written April 5, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2919,Crazy overcrowded and under-served.,"It is shocking to me that anyone can give this resort anything but a terrible score. Disney have been greedy and irresponsible letting in about 5 times more people than the park can realistically serve. Having queues as long as 4 hours in the blistering sun for a single 10-minute ride is not only a terrible experience, it should be illegal. While the queues are very civilized and well organized in classic Japanese style, no amount of red tape will ever cover up the fact that Disney have been abusing park attendees with it's admittance policies.

Having just returned from a two-day foray into the resort I can't recommend enough that people STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS HOLE. The amount of people meant that it was near impossible to move around, let alone get on any rides. Forget about FastPasses too because by 10:30 most of them were gone and the queues at the ticketing sections were full and closed. When you having 20 meter queues at your popcorn stands you know that you have an overcrowding problem and of course management was STILL selling more tickets and letting people come in. I felt like I was going crazy, queues started forming everywhere and for everything. Why the hell do the Japanese locals put up with this is beyond me, I guess it's a cultural difference. If you're not of a culture that imbues you with interminable patience DO NOT GO TO THIS PARK.","Written April 5, 2013",1.0 of 5 bubbles

Although the staff are very friendly and the park is exceptionally clean, there are long queues for absolutely EVERYTHING including food, toilets, photo with characters and rides. For instance, we waited for over two hours for a two minute ride. Even souvenir shops are completely packed with people.

2926,Great sights,"Our kids made it clear that every trip to Tokyo must include the famous theme park. We came again in January particularly to also cover the Monster Inc. Ride which is similar to that in California and not available in Paris or Hong Kong. It was one of the park's favourite attraction along with Winnie the Pooh Ride etc. so go get a Fast Pass in advance. Do note that you can only get one Fast Pass at a time. The crowd in Tokyo Disneyland can be overwhelming as it is very popular among Asian tourists and local Japanese. Best to visit Monday to Thursday and plan ahead where to go. We managed to cover a record 11 rides this time! Do check ahead at the website for locations of the special events. The Nightime Parade is quite spectacular but it's freezing cold in winter so be prepared with warm clothing's. Don't be surprised with a fair bit of shopping as the merchandise here are quite attractive with some unique items available or being sold here first. Departing from the theme park, we find it easier to take the Disneyland bus rather the train where you need to walk some 15-20min (with kids) to reach the station. However, do know the bus timetable ahead and you may need to arrive early to get seats.","Written March 27, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2927,Always a dream!,"We went here last year on the 4th of October 2012 (Thursday). I am myself a huge Disney fan, and have been to Tokyo Disneyland before. This is my 5th visit, but it's my 1st visit with my 3 year old son. Things are obviously different with a small kid in tow, we move in a slower pace but nevertheless the experience is still very fun and entertaining for all of us. You can rent a stroller/pram there for about ¬•700 for a whole day. We brought our own pram though.. For those with smaller babies, there's two baby centers.. One in Toon Town and the other in World Bazaar (just before Tomorrowland) and you can use the microwave there, nurse your baby or request for hot water for the baby's formula. There's always a stroller parking spot in almost every ride, so you can park your stroller there.

We arrived at about 9ish (we didn't go early to wait at the entrance before opening time) and had a light breakfast first there - I would recommend to arrive earlier and have breakfast beforehand to save time though. We planned to do this, but as some of you may know, with kids sometimes things just doesn't go as planned. =)

The queue in the morning is bearable, we waited for about 5 to 25 minutes maximum to go on the rides. The more popular rides have longer waiting time. In the afternoon, the queue times become longer (about 60 minutes+++). Perhaps more people come to the park after school/work? However we got to ride all of the rides we wanted to go on in one day, which is good. Totally different story with Disney Sea the next day, but that's a whole other review to write.

Everything is very clean here, food is your average theme park quality (but cuter). Everyone is very friendly and happy to help.

Long queue to meet and greet the characters, especially Micky and Minnie.

TIP: if you can, check when and what day you will be at TDL. School Holidays, public holidays and weekends need to be avoided at all cost (unless you want to wait for 2-3 hrs for each ride), and the day before and after long weekend.
Generally saying, the safest day to go is either a Wednesday or Thursday. There's a website that predicts how crowded TDL and TDS will be, but it's in Japanese.","Written March 27, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Getting there is fairly easy by train, not sure how the bus is. Now, because I live in Australia, I got very excited that I was going to DisneyLand and because I was alone, I could go on any ride I wanted, talk about a day being a kid!

My sister went to DisneyLand in America a few months before so the rides were similar except a few were different, I believe the Monsters Inc ride was different. The lines were long, but that is to be expected from any DisneyLand. If you like DisneyLand type parks, then you'll love this one. Like the big tourist things in Japan, everything is in Japanese and English.

If you go, obviously spend the whole day, get on as many rides as possible and watch the parades. Whilst I was there (early December 2012) there was a spectacular night parade where the floats were made up of led lights that would flash and change color. All in all, a great day, but try to stay away from the ""Western"" area if you're coming from Australia, USA, UK, etc as it's more for the Japanese and can be boring.","Written March 26, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles

2931,Disappointing- line ups atrocious,"Be warned!!!!!----February mid-week was traditionally a great time to go to Disneyland, as it was slow season and if you dressed warmly- you were set as the lines up would be reasonable. This is no longer the case. We went yesterday on a Thursday- parking lot looked fine but there were many buses entering. Park opened at 9 am, line ups were 2 to 3 hours long by 9:20 and fast passes were gone for the day or the lines ups for the fast passes were 30 minutes long. The line up for Thunder Mountain went down the park past Bear Jamboree- 3 hours long. The line up for Buzz lite year- went around the Tomorrowland restaurant- a good 2 hours or more. You pay for Disney so that you can go on the rides- with these line ups you would perhaps get 2 or 3 rides in a day and a few little ones like the merry-go-round.
The park now has a student promotion during this time period, and does not seem to be limiting the amount of schools visiting. The park was ""swarming' with young people. Although happy for their day off from school, they all are going on the big name rides, there is no mix of visitors- leading to long wait times. They have over sold the bus tours to bring their revenue up. This spoiled the day for everyone- I am not paying to stand in line all day to do 3 rides in a day. This is unreasonable. I am not a money machine for Disney and that's how I felt.
We are quite unlikely to return with our family to this Disney Park- a shame. But it is becoming impossible to find a medium crowd day anymore. Our money will be better spent at another Disney Park or a competitor.","Written February 21, 2013",2.0 of 5 bubbles

The place was great. I loved the different themes such as the Little Mermaid and Aladdin. Of course, the park was very clean. Loved the different kinds of popcorn flavors sold throughout the park and the different sorts of pastries. The park was also very friendly for families with strollers. Most of the rides were child friendly especially for 3 year olds. Overall the experience was great and I wouldn't mind going back again and again maybe when my son gets older. Only note is to make sure you've got spending money especially if you want to bring home souvenirs and do miscellaneous shopping at the park. The only disadvantage if needed be mention is that most of the shows were in Japanese (which is expected being in Japan) but the nice thing is they provided little monitor looking gadgets which provide English subtitles.","Written February 17, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2934,Exceeded my expectations,"Tokyo Disneyland is practically identical to the one in California, so if you have been to that one, do not expect anything new here. The biggest difference is obviously that the characters speak in Japanese in the park and on the rides, although they still sing the songs in their English form.

I went on a cold, rainy day in January and had practically no waits in any of the lines. I have been to Disneyland/DisneyWorld many times, so I was a bit bummed that I wasted a day in a culturally-rich place going to the same park. However, if you have never been, Disneyland is amazing.

The park entrance is directly next to the entrance of DisneySea (in comparison-- AMAZING and 100% worth it), so your party can split up and meet in front of the gates at the end of the day if necessary.

There were not many rides, main ones would be Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain. The haunted house was not open when we visited. There are also lots of local tourists and very few foreign tourists. You'll have to sit on the floor to watch the parade so many of the local tourists bring their own mats to lay on the floor. We went on a Sunday and saw the 2PM parade, as well as the 7.30PM electrical parade. Fireworks was not very spectacular.

2937,Just like in the U.S.,"Its so wrong to think that Disneyland is only for the children. It is for everyone, from the very young to the seniors.
A fairytale land where one can just forget about the world outside and enjoy themselves.

There are things just about for anyone.

Most of the rides are catered for the family and younger children, so they tend to be mild. Still, there are some more thrilling ones; a personal favourite being the Space Mountain.

I had to battle the crowds even when I visited on a weekday. There were tourists and locals swarming the park.

Entrance tickets can be purchased online, at the Disney store in Shibuya or at the park entrance itself. The only thing about buying tickets at the park itself? You will have to wait and queue.

Food outlets are located all over the park, so are souvenir shops.

It would be good to check out when the daily parade takes place. Not sure if there is a fixed timing for it. If so, it is at 2pm on weekdays. This is when the various Disney characters appear in song and dance, going past the waving crowd.

Photo-taking with individual characters can also be done.. but it was really tough with the more popular characters. What with so many people vying for their attention!

Fireworks are not on every evening. Please check the park calendar and schedule if you are visiting to see the fireworks.

Operating hours of the park varies too!! Please check their website.

As an American, I relished in the idea of it snowing at a Disney park. It's magical in an entirely new way. That being said, if you visit in Winter, be warned! The day I went, the forecast was rainy and 40 degrees F. It rapidly became a slushy, snowy pile up. Luckily the park sells many ponchos and umbrellas.

2. Space mountain - because I love roller coaster rides.

2942,Amazing!,"Having never been to Disney anything, we simply had to make a trip to Disneyland. Being an avid fan of Disney cartoons after growing up on a steady diet of Cinderella, Peter Pan and Lion King reruns, it was a most memorable day, and it was really fun to boot. Don't worry about the language problem. I cannot speak Japanese and got along fine. Just be warned that anything that speaks in rides speaks in Japanese. You'll still get the main idea.

I am terrified of roller coasters so there is no review of that. Instead, I really enjoyed all the kiddy rides we took. The Peter Pan ride had fantastic animatronics, including a whole lighted-up city. It really felt as though we were flying through the story. My personal favourite is 'It's a Small World'. Since we were there during the New Year's season, it was still running a special Christmas and New Year's display that was really pretty! Also enjoyed cheesy things like a cruise along the river in the big steamer boat, spinning teacups and the carousel. The Pooh's Hunny Hunt ride is also pretty awesome and if you love cutesy things, you have to rush for your Fast pass or queue up for it. Missed out on Monsters Inc and the Buzz Lightyear ride so I guess I'll have to go back for that! Food is pricey so we bought lots of snacks from a convenience store near our accommodation and brought it over though. There were lots of families with little kids around when we visited so it's certainly a place that's great for people of all ages.","Written January 17, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2943,Fun day out!,"Tokyo Disneyland is still tons of fun even if you don't speak Japanese. For one thing, it looks absolutely fantastic - and, in this case, a vista is worth a thousand words! Many of the favourite rides from Disney theme parks elsewhere in the world are here.
Our favourites are Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, Space Mountain, Star Tours, Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain and Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. The ""must not miss' event is the electric parade, which is absolutely dazzling. We also liked the shows ""One Man's Dream II - the Magic Lives On"" and ""Minnie, Oh Minnie"".
You will need at least 2 days to try all the rides and see all the shows and attractions at Tokyo Disneyland. If you only have 2 days, then spend at least one at Tokyo Disney Sea, and if you only have one day, I would recommend Tokyo Disney Sea. The shows are way better, the attractions are more sophisticated, the rides are great and the park, overall, is more beautiful.
If you don't already have tickets, get to Tokyo Disneyland an hour early, at least. The queues to buy tickets (and to get in) can be bad. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are the quietest days, but they can still be busy. The ""busy"" days can be really bad. I went on a busy day once, and I won't do it again. It's not worth it and it's really frustrating. On less busy days get to shows at least 20 minutes early to get a seat. Use Fastpasses as much as possible.
To get to Tokyo Disneyland, get the subway to Maihama Subway station, and then transfer to the Disney Resort Monorail. There are plenty of signs and Disney employees to point the way.
One hint is to take something to sit on (like a folded towel, flat cushion or a piece of cardboard). When you're waiting for parades, the evening fireworks show, and even in the queues to enter the theme park, you may be grateful for something to sit on.
Always check online before you go, as opening and closing times change. We've been caught waiting for an extra hour for the gates to open. Also, if you have your heart set on a particular ride or attraction, check online that it's open. Currently the ""Haunted Mansion"", Star Tours "" and ""It's a Small World"" are closed. As you buy your ticket remember to get the map AND the day's program off shows in English.","Written January 14, 2013",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2944,Language not an issue,"This place seems bigger than the one in Anaheim and there is not a terribly long queue for most rides. We covered almost the entire park on one full day from 10 to 7 and still have enough time to shop some souvenirs. My children also loves the parades and were particularly impressed with the pirates of caribbean rides. I would definitely recommend people to come in the winter as there are less foreign tourists, less queues, and just as many rides you can enjoy as it is in the summer without the overbearing heat. Although it is chilly, it is not too cold at all in winter for this part of Japan anyway.","Written January 13, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2945,"Children paradise, and moms who like to shop","Visited during June 2011. Bit after the tsunami that rocked Japan. My kids were 4 & 5 then. Just started adding review to trip advisior so feel i have to do justice to adding 5 stars to a place that really deserves it.

Rides were interesting and interactive. Place was crowded but seriously the imangination and interaction behind the rides were well worth it. My family's personal favourites were Peter Pan, Honey Hunt, Buzz Lightyear, grand circuit race the boat ride on the ""missippi"" ...actually it's hard to find rides i didn't like.

The rides were well maintained, customes and staff were TOP NOTCH. The Disneyland staff really take pride in their job ...i love that!! they undertsand what their job is and do it right with pride.

I felt like a kid again and my kids...well they were in heaven!!. I sent 2 days there...i think a a minimum to deal with the crowds and long queues...you probably need that much time...if you can afford more do it.

The parades were top notch. Most of the visitors when i was there were Japanese...who were welll behaved and well mannered.

I was articularly impressed with the staff and level of details with the rides, areas near the attraction which showcased the rides or attractions. It was a talikng point for the kids.

I have been to the Osaka Universal Studio and also one in Singapore and Australia.

Recently visited Kidzania in Malaysia. This place trumps them all.

2946,Amazing Amazing Best theme park experience thus far,"I visited Disneyland with my two children 21 & 25 in December, 2012. The day got off to a bad start as we got on the worng queue and had to change after that I couldn't use my credit cards (mastercard & visa) to buy a two day pass as the park as they only take JCB and possibly one China card. I found this amazing for such a tourist attraction - they have a bank inside but this also didn't take mastercard or visa.. We had just enough cash but didn't want to spend the day without much cash so I went out took the monorail 250 yen each way to Ikipiara where they had an ATM to get money out and back on the monorail queue again before I could start the day. At least we had english maps which helped.

The park is similar to Anahiem but the excitement level of several of the rides like Pirates of the Carribean has been reduced, e.g only one minor drop.

The crowds were large and seemed to get larger as the day wore on. All the parades like other Disneylands were amazing and spectacular although it did seem funny for the talking to be in Japanese but the songs in English. Characters were available for photos and were very friendly.

The queue for rides were fairly long but not too bad but none of the professional photographers spoke English.

Whilst I loved Dinseyland I don't think it is as good as the original.","Written January 1, 2013",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We saw 3 parades, which I think are always the best. We were disappointed that the stores didn't sell the American stuff....Japanese sweets just aren't as good.

We loved the river safari the most, although our kid seems to fell in love with the 'small-world' rides.

Staff were friendly and helpful, and the crowds were very organized too. Queue can be super-long, some attractions had more than an-hour queuing time.

2949,Tokyo Disneyland,"We went on the 4th of December - a mildly rainy Tuesday- we never queued any longer than 15 minutes. We did use the fast passes but most of the time it was quicker just to queue for the ride. Occasionally we saw rides with wait times up around 45 minutes so we would walk onto another ride and come back. We rode everything we wanted plus some of them several times, we managed space mountain and splash mountain twice - the latter with a queue of 10 minutes. I think we must have got really lucky. We were able to get front row seats for the parades by wandering up 15 minutes before the start time. I think it might have been the weather forecast that helped us as it was supposed to thunderstorm - but the storms did not eventuate. When it did rain a little, the staff came out with squeegees and dried all the seats, paths and even the tops of the bins. Our family of four had a wonderful time and found the food reasonably priced. Only down side it that my husband only just fit into some of the rides and he is 6 feet 2 inches so people over about 6ft 4 inches would probably not fit on space mountain or splash mountain as my husband had to sort of sit sideways on these. Thunder mountain was closed for maintenance during our visit. I was really impressed with the general condition of the park and the quality of the rides and none of them were too scary for me who doesn't really enjoy the big thrill rides.","Written December 25, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2950,Fun place but knowing the language would be useful,"Well managed with good service staff. My family visited in winter and the place was packed but we could still get on to the river boat and train without any difficulty. Overall the signposts were clear but it was slightly difficult conversing with the staff who spoke mainly Japanese. The more popular rides involved quite a bit of a wait, some over 30mins long. Staying near or in the resort would be an advantage but not really necessary as it is quite easy to get there using Tokyo''s very extensive rail and bus network.","Written December 24, 2012",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2951,Not worth the money because of the staff attitude.,"I'm sure that a lot of you know what to expect in a Disney resort, so I'm just going to give some really helpful tips that will make your visit to TDL the best.

1: KNOW WHEN TO GO. You want to go when school is in session for most and when it's raining. Yes, Disneyland is VERY fun even when it's raining. June is the best time to go, when we have our ""tsuyu"" season and when most kids are still in school.
2: MAKE A PLAN FOR THE DAY. You can really lose a lot of time if you're just wandering around. TDL is pretty big but its organized. Before you head out, make sure you have the map somewhat memorized (like the general locations of each themed place). This really helped me to make the most of my time there.
3: DON'T WASTE TIME SHOPPING. I don't exactly know why a lot of people spend a lot of time shopping for goods. Most of the stuff you can just buy at your hotel (it's true; they repeat goods here!)
4: BUY THOSE FAST PASSES. The popular rides (Space, Thunder, Splash Mountains) can get really crowded.
5: BRING LUNCH. The food in Disney Sea, I have to admit, is way better than the food served in TDL, unless you want to eat at Blue Bayou. Blue Bayou is the best restaurant offered here but you must make reservations in advance, especially for dinner.
6: WEAR SNEAKERS. I've seen a lot of people here running and tripping because they weren't wearing appropriate footwear. Sneakers is the best way to go. Wear them and be prepared to run when you need to.
7. LEARN BASIC JAPANESE BEFORE YOU GO. People here don't really speak English very well. If you want to really enjoy your time here, learn a few phrases before you go. ""Where is the bathroom?"" is ""Otearai wa doko desuka?"" If you want to know where a certain ride is, ""*name of the ride* wa doko desuka?"" I can't say everything here so make sure to buy one of those books with simple Japanese phrases.

Have fun!","Written December 21, 2012",1.0 of 5 bubbles
2952,Everything is better in Japan!!,"Love it, love it.

Heaps of great rides - some of the little kid rides (Peter Pan, mostly) are great for adults too, just for the amazing detail and thought that's gone into each one.

No real thrill rides - a major plus in my book! But lots and lots of fun. Especially Splash Mountain. :)

Fantastic shows, shops, rides, food. Light years better than any Australian theme park!

Lines can get up to a couple of hours, so get the Fast Pass if it's available - it means you come back at a particular time and get in the Express Queue.

FOOD ALLERGIES AND TOKYO DISNEYLAND:
I visited most recently in 2012 with my gluten free brother. It's actually pretty good for food intolerances/allergies. At the restaurants (the fancier ones, not the takeaway outlets) they will have an allergy free set-meal. So you'll get a drink, meal item and dessert. About 1000 yen, so not very expensive, either and won't contain wheat, egg, dairy, nuts... I don't remember what else, but all the major allergies.
One thing - these restaurants tend to close around six I think (the park is open til 10), so get dinner fairly early.","Written December 20, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

2955,Tokyo Disney Halloween - Cool!,"I stayed at the Sheraton Grande for one night. There is a stop for the Disney monorail directly across the street. It comes every 4 minutes and circles the DisneySea, Metro Station, Disneyland and the hotels. There is a ticket machine at the stop but you need cash. I could not figure out how to use a credit card with all directions in Japanese. I lucked out and someone coming off the train saw me struggling and handed me their day monorail pass. At the entrance to the park I bought an evening pass to Tokyo Disneyland around 4pm which let me in at 6pm sharp. I went over to the Disneyland Resort and had a drink in the bar looking out over the park as the sun set. Long lines began forming waiting for the night pass entry at 6, so you need to get in line early. I was concerned they would be sold out on a Friday night but they were still selling tickets at 4. I forgot to reserve the ticket at least a week in advance and was unable to get it online. Advance tickets are available from 2 months to one week before.

It was October so the park was dark at 6 but it was a Halloween themed night with jack-o-lanterns everywhere so dark was great. It was entertaining to hear announcements in Japanese and also in English by the familiar male voice from the other parks at LA and Orlando. Signs were in both English and Japanese. I rode the Haunted Mansion and it was all in Japanese with no English at all. The line was over an hour long so I only had time for one. I did note the tombstones on the way in were in English. The theme was around Jack from Nightmare before Christmas and it featured Sandy Claus and a Christmas theme, but I had no idea what it was actually about. There was an impressive electrical parade and fireworks. The center area of Tokyo Disney is much larger than DisneyWorld/Land the paraded circled around it and so there were more places to see the parade. The Halloween fireworks show was substantially shorter and less impressive than the one at Disney World in Orlando. Everything in the park was very familiar and laid out in the same order as the other parks - AdventureLand, FrontierLand, FantasyLand, TomorrowLand. There was a TuneTown that was much larger than DisneyWorld and more Roger Rabbit oriented. I saw very few non-Japanese in the crowd and everyone was wearing Mickey ears it seemed. I could find no ""I was there"" Tokyo Disney t-shirts anywhere. Just general Disney themed shirts with Mickey, Donald, etc. It was a really cool experience.","Written November 26, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Winnie the Pooh was about 90 minutes or so.,"Written November 5, 2012",3.0 of 5 bubbles
2962,Interesting combination of old-school and new-school Disney,"I grew up visiting various Disneyworld theme parks in Florida, so as a big kid I just could not resist visiting Tokyo Disneyland with my husband in mid-October 2012 (on a Monday). I was shocked at how many people were there on a weekday, almost all of them Japanese and far more adults than children. The Japanese really love Disney (I saw a businessman with a Mickey Mouse keychain on the train one day!).

First, the rides. They still have some of the oldest Disney rides that I think they've removed from most Disney parks, such as It's a Small World, Country Bears Theatre and even Captain EO (1987 Michael Jackson space opera that I thought I'd never see again in my life!). All of these rides had next to no queue at all, but I loved them for the old-school nostalgia.

On the other hand, they also had more recent film rides, such as Monsters Inc, Toy Story, and even a Winnie the Pooh ride I haven't seen elsewhere. Other classics, such as the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, were 'updated' - Pirates has inserted Jack Sparrow (who looks creepy because it's a really realistic character next to cartoony animatronic pirates) and the Mansion is now Nightmare Before Christmas themed (again, tacked on top of the old-fashioned ghosts, it seems very odd to me).

It was a bit difficult to anticipate which rides the Japanese adore and which they ignore. Almost the queues were 60-90 minutes within an hour or two of opening and you only get a chance to use your fast pass 2 or 3 times before that sells out too. We ended up only going to 2 or 3 of the big-name rides because we didn't have the energy to wait in line after about lunchtime. Even the smaller rides like Peter Pan and Snow White had 45-60 minute queues in the afternoon.

The big surprise for us was Pirates of the Caribbean - 20 minute wait in the middle of the day! The Beaver Brothers canoe ride was kind of fun too with only a 10 minute wait, although the guide only spoke Japanese he started up a chant of ""ichi - ni, one - two"" for our sake.

Other considerations: Most rides are translated into Japanese, which doesn't really matter since you get the idea regardless (Captain EO just used subtitles, it was in English).

We didn't find the queues for food were bad, except the popcorn carts early in the day. Apparently the Japanese adore flavoured popcorn, so instead of waiting for soy sauce or curry popcorn just buy another snack!

The parade is quite fun and a good break, just wait until about 20 minutes beforehand and sit yourself down for a nice rest.

Finally, we forgot to buy our ticket beforehand but it didn't matter. We got there right on opening time and the queue was to enter the park - there was no queue to buy the ticket first.

Final verdict? If you love Disneyland, you will love Tokyo Disney - it's like American Disney but even cleaner, more polite and with fewer obnoxious visitors. But be aware that unless you get really lucky you will not get to ride everything you want. If you accept this from the start you can have a really magical visit.","Written November 2, 2012",4.0 of 5 bubbles
2963,Must do for Disney fan!,"If you love Disney you will love Tokyo Disneyland. The park has attractions for all ages and to interest everyone. The park has incredible theming with no detail spared. Everything down to the shape of food. I would describe this as Walt Disney World 1997 as far as the quality of the Disney Experience goes.
It is important to note that this being Japan the characters and shows are in Japanese. Some attractions have English support. The staff also speak Japanese although English is available on menus and some staff members also can assist in English.","Written October 29, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

2965,The happiest place on earth,"I spent most of my day in Disneyland walking around, taking photos, and watching the various parades and shows.

The parades are a joy to watch, particularly if you're a Disney fan. They're bright and colourful and enjoyable. The dancers in the parades look like they're enjoying themselves and they enjoy interacting with the audience as well - kids receive special attention, of course.
The trick to getting a good viewing spot for the parades is to just show up early and grab your seat. You can sit down just about anywhere along the parade route, but they don't allow you to take out your folding chairs or mats and stuff until half an hour to showtime. I caught the Easter Wonderland Parade, the Jubilation! Parade, and the Electrical Parade. For Jubilation! I got there about an hour before the show began and got myself a prime spot. (It was really hot, but I persevered, knowing that if I got up and walked away, someone else would be sitting there when I came back.) I went to look for a place to sit down more than an hour before the Electrical Parade in the evening, but many of the best spots were taken already!

Disneyland was almost ridiculously crowded, which meant that rides were rather out of the question for me since I had no intention of standing 2-3 hours in line for a ride, though there were some I badly wanted to try. I was also on my own there, so an overly long queue would have been no fun at all.

That said, I did manage to hop on the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster in the night, right after the Electrical Parade. I had a wait time of 40 minutes for that, which was bearable in comparison to the 3-hour wait time specified for Splash Mountain in the morning. Big Thunder Mountain was lots of fun! Given that Space Mountain was closed at the time, I think I made the right choice in picking Big Thunder Mountain then.

Disneyland is totally worth a visit if you have the time for it and if you love Disney.","Written October 25, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

2970,Disney fun - Tokyo style,"Visiting Tokyo Disney Land is a really fun way to spend a day! The park is beautifully decorated and it is really fun to take in all the sights and the people dressing up in the Disney character costumes and hats. There are some classic Disney rides like Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean, but because the dialogue on the rides are in Japanese, even familiar rides will feel new! It‚Äôs still easy to follow the plot even I you don‚Äôt understand Japanese ‚Äì hearing all the songs and familiar characters in Japanese is actually quite entertaining! You can get translator devices at some of the shows ‚Äì just ask the attendants at the entrance. As always, you can expect long queues at all the popular rides, so make use of the Fast Pass system if you can. I managed to get three Fast Passes and they were very useful!

There is a wide selection of food and snacks (both Eastern and Western), so you'll definitely find something that suits your taste. The selection of different popcorn flavours was really amazing - I tried the Caramel flavour as well as the Curry flavour... both were really delicious.

Be sure to get there at least one hour before the park opens - the Japanese believe in arriving early, so you can expect long queues if you get there late. There are ATM's inside the park, but they only take Japanese and Chinese bank cards, so if you do not have one of these, be sure to bring plenty of cash with you. There is a small bank with a cashier desk where you can charge cash to your credit card, but to do this, you need to give them some kind of identification.

Also be sure to wear comfortable shoes - the park is quite large and the best rides are spread all over the park, so you'll do a lot of walking. I wouldn't recommend going on a very hot day - it will definitely not be pleasant walking around the park in the height of summer! Also, most of the park is not under cover, so it will be very unpleasant if it is raining.","Written October 9, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Would like to buy your child popcorn? Get in line and wait at leas 30 minutes. Depending on the location within the park you may also need to get in line to get in the restrooms, especially girls.

2976,Immaculate!,"Been to Disneyland in California, Paris and now Tokyo. Without a doubt, Disneyland Tokyo is the most authentic. Recall thinking Disneyland Paris was a bit shabby with chipping paint and some of the mechanical characters not working correctly in some of the rides. Nothing like that here in Tokyo. Everything is in good working order, grounds are beautiful, and every detail is perfect. Everyone smiles and is so polite like no place but Japan!

Negatives...The Japanese queue like no other nation. 2, 3, even 4 hours doesn't seem to phase them. Rain comes, umbrellas come out, raincoats go on, no one seems to go home, and they just endure with a smile.

Tip - Use ""Fast Pass"" judiciously. Ran with my son to Space Mountain, got fast pass and got in line. One of the first ones here so got on the ride in about 20 minutes. Ran over to Big Thunder Mountain, got Fast Pass then waited for 45 minutes in the normal line (Still early in the morning!). Then ran back over to Space Mountain to get on with Fast Pass (5 minute wait), then ran to Splash Mountain, got a Fast Pass ticket and over to Big Thunder Mountain for our second ride. Thing is, after you get a fast pass you have a period of time before you can use it again. Each ride only has so many Fast Pass reservation times and once they get to park closing times, the Fast Pass is shut off for that ride. If you use it right on time, you might get 5 or 6 Fast Passes through the day and you really don't even have to wait for the ride with Fast Pass - 5 10 min max. My son figured this all out from going with a friend before and I will tell you, saves you tons of time waiting in lines.","Written September 24, 2012",4.0 of 5 bubbles

The only down side is the characters like Goofy and others. They have a special place for Mickey and some others only. Characters like Goofy and others are on the road. They will not take photo with kids unlike Disney World. Also, most of the 3D movies are in Japanese. The rides recommended at disneysea are Toy story mania and tower of terror (for adults).

They are also very orderly when waiting for parades to start.

Language is not a problem since you can rely on the park's map to get around though performances are in Japanese language.

However, I don't know why closing fireworks were cancelled that night. We couldn't understand the announcement. The only disappointment.

Also note that you can RE-ENTER the park on the SAME day with your ticket.. something we didn't know!

2979,Memorable Trip To Tokyo Disney Land,"We visited Tokyo Disney Land in September 2012. One day ticket for an adult costs 6200 yen for all the attractions in the Land. The flowers and trees have been beautifully planted and arranged to add beauty to the buildings and at a number of places Japanese topiary attracts one's attention. To maximize one's fun out of different rides one should get fast passes. By getting a fast pass we get a time allotted to use the ride without getting in long ques. When fast pass for one attraction is issued, fast pass for next attraction will be issued after the time starts for the first attraction. All attractions and rides are fun. I loved Adventure Park the most with its Critters Island Get Wet ride. Tokyo Disney Land and Disney Sea both are a must see. They are too much fun and scenic beauty. The parades in the day and the electrical parade and fireworks at night are spectacular. To visit Tokyo Disney Sea you need another ticket.","Written September 19, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Be prepared for the Japanese queuing, however... they had to make a rule that you can't line up to watch a parade until at least 2 (or was it 3?) hours before it starts. Just keep your eyes open not to trip on people on plastic traps seemingly in the middle of the street. :)","Written September 17, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles
2981,spectacular,"This park is always full of people. Rain or Dry. Lines are always long but If you are strategic enough to plan your rides and shows using your fast pass then it should be okay. We queued for 1.5 hours for only 1 attraction per day and the rest are using past pass n single rider. YES! they do have single rider,but only for 1-2 attractions. However, they told me that no single rider on one of the day that we went there(Saturday). Since we have 1 year old, we have to use the switch system for the rides that babies were not allowed. Told the staff that were were going to switch, then they would gave you 1 pc of paper. 1 person queued for the ride and 1 person took care of my daughter. Once the person were done with the ride then the other person switched to go for the ride using the paper that the staff gave earlier then he/she will be allowed to go in to the fast pass lane. So, no more queueing for the 2nd person.

They are using the lottery system for the entrance to 1 of the show(One Man's Dream). You can only try your luck once a day. We didn't win the lottery for both days that we went to Disneyland, so bummer on that. Japanese people are very systematic . Everybody were asked to sit down during the parade, so everybody could see it. We were even told to fold the stroller and laid it down on the floor.

I compare Tokyo Disneyland to the fun I had in Disney World while growing up. Just amazingly fun, but this time as an adult with my husband. Even have the castle, which is a staple I grew up on. (Which I recently found out, to my trip to Disneyland in California, they only have a tiny castle.)

This particular park does have it's own Japanese atmosphere, but it's still an amazing place, and you see so many young folks and families come here for fun. It's got two parks. Disneyland itself and Disney Sea. Disney Sea, while it may have one or two rides I can recall for kids, seems to be more adult oriented. Disney Sea is what has things like Tower of Terror and all. Each is worth a visit on a separate day for maximum fun.

There might be some slight altercations to things to fit in with the culture. I know with the Tower of Terror is Disney Sea, it incorporates Stitch (from Lilo and Stitch) into the story before you ride on it. That is something I do not remember being in the US version. (Assuming it's not changed, which I do not believe it has.)

2993,Good fun and Cute,"As expected from the Japanese, the park and equipments were clean, well-maintained and efficiently run. Shows were good and we saw many of them although we would have seen more if we got our hands on the show program timetable earlier. There was none at the entrance where we got our park map. We only found out that there's show timetable in the afternoon from a staff on the park street.

Many shows were in Japanese but were presented in very uplifting spirits that you also felt the vibe. Most staff had limited English when the questions get a bit more complicated. My kid lost our camcorder in the 4D (or 5D, 6D whatever) cinema and the staff wouldn't let us look for it when the show finished due to other session starting. We waited outside the cinema and the staff found it for us about 15 minutes later.

Food were more expensive than outside but not at killing prices. We had fast food but found the serving size very small (small hamburgers, etc.). Since this was the only time we had fast food in Japan so not sure if this is common seving size or just because it's in DNL.

All in all, it was good fun! Fireworks was a bit disappointing. Expected something more spectacular. However, night parade and lighting were nice, particularly the Cinderella castle. Lighting on some streets (inside DNL) were inadequate. It was really dark some streets near the Cinderella castle.

Splash Mountain reduced our son to tears, but he has since been showing off about doing it! It's all great fun and there's something for everyone.

Not nearly as crowded at Disney Tokyo (never more than a 20 minute wait for rides/attractions and mostly no wait at all).

What amazed us the most was the cleanliness of the park as well as how well they catered to their youngest audience. I have 2 toddlers (boys) and every bathroom had toddler size sink and also toilets. Even the women's restrooms each had a little urinal for the boys.

All the different popcorn is worth a try! Loved the soy sauce and butter flavor =)

3005,Good for kids,"I was expecting 2 hour lines and a generally terrible time as this is all I remembered from the last time I went to Tokyo Disneyland more than 13 years ago. I went with a large group of 9 on a Wednesday when a typhoon was on its way. The uncertain weather forecast must have scared a lot of folks away because the longest we waited for 20 minutes for the Hunny Hunt. I would highly recommend fast-passing Splash Mountain as the line for this attraction is ALWAYS long. There isn't much for vegetarians but if you can handle lots of popcorn and some dairy, you will survive (as I did). The food options were a little lacking but the prices weren't as exorbitant as I'd expected things to be. Most rides were child-friendly and all rides are at least 'big kid' friendly (you have to be at least 110cm to do the 'big kid' rides).
If you have time, I would highly recommend the electrical parade. There is just something whimsical and magical about the floats, the dancers, and of course, that irritating electrical parade tune. Watching the bright lights and all definitely fueled the inner-child in me, it was great.
The fire works show however, was pretty lame and not really worth watching...

Fastpass tickets can be obtained at 2 hour intervals. Queues were on average about 15-20 minutes, so it wasn't too bad I suppose. The food and beverage selection definitely needs to be worked on. Lack of healthy / delicious meals. What we saw was food fast food style!

3008,A Park All Its Own,"I owed my niece her High School Graduation present and taking her with me to Tokyo was it.
It is recommended to anyone planning to attend either park at the Tokyo Disney Resort to visit the official site to make your reservations way ahead of time. This will guarantee your admission to the park even if the park is at capacity and they stop selling tickets.

Getting your tickets at the resort is very easy. Just head to the lower lever of the Ikspiari Mall (Their Downtown Disney), and show them your reservation confirmation printout. Took us less than 5 minutes to be on our way.

From the moment you step through the main gate, you can noticed the difference in quality on everything around you. World Bazzar (Main Street) might look small from your first glance, but it is actually big and has a huge glass roof covering the area in case of rain or snow, which is very nice to have.

There are a lot of attractions here that, if you've been to the parks in the States, are very similar. There are, however, some with enough differences to make it worth getting in line for. Space Mountain has, from the outside, a retro 70's feel to it since this one still has the escalator to the second level just like the one at Disneyland used to have. The inside, has been completely re-done and, in my opinion, has the best show theme out of the 3 Space Mountains I've been on.

If you are not a fan of attractions aimed for children, I would suggest to make an exception for Pooh's Honey Hunt in Fantasyland. It is nothing at all like its counterparts in the U.S. parks at all. It is completely its own experience implementing some of the best technology that I've seen on any attraction. It will have you feeling like you are 5 years old again.

Food choices are plenty and everywhere you go on this park. We ate at the Queen of Hearts Dining Hall and the quality of the food was superb. It was just and overall great eating experience, from the greeting at the door to our farewell.

Plenty of snacks around the park at a moderate price. Yes, things here were not as expensive as some people make them out to look.

We were there on the day of a pretty big storm. The biggest to hit Tokyo since 1959. So the park was empty most from around 3 pm and on and we got to enjoy the park even with the wind and rain. I recommend staying at a hotel withing a moderate distance to the resort in case you get bad weather and they stop the trains. We were able to take a cab for a reasonable price back to our hotel that night after the train service was suspended due to high winds.

If you get done with the park at a good time, I recommend taking a stroll at the Ikspiari Mall. There are a lot of good shops for shopping and really good restaurants to eat at catered to all budgets.","Written June 25, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

The crowds also prevented us from having a seat out of the sun to rest our tired legs and eat some lunch.

We did our research and had decided beforehand it was going to be Wed or Thursday or never... I'm sure you've all read the warnings about crowds on Friday, Saturday and Sundays!

The day before, we went to Shibuya and bought tickets from the Disney Store. It was relatively easy to find and meant we didn't have to line up at Disneyland the next morning (well, to buy tickets anyway).

We caught the subway/train out to Disneyland, which was relatively easy. As we were changing trains we saw a lot of school children in groups at the station - a sign of how many people were going to be there! Anyway, no hassles on the train and we arrived out at Disneyland at 8am (an hour early). The opening hours vary day to day so check before hand - we checked at the Disney Store in Shibuya.

Once we were there we lined up at one of the many gates. We were about 20th in line at our gate. To our dismay at about 8.45am they started letting people in, we came to the conclusion that they were VIP guests (if there are such thing?). At 9am they started opening some gates, the ones to the right of us were first in.. and people starting RUNNING! Anyway, as soon as ours opened we RAN - you should too! It's good fun if nothing else.

Fastpass system!
The way I had understood it was different to how it actually works.
Example: You get in the gate at 9.30am and get your fast pass from a ride at this time. This means you can't collect another fast pass for ANY ride until an hour later, ie. 10.30am. You can only collect a Fastpass every hour on the half past. I think this is a good system, as it means that even if you turn up at 11am, you still have a chance of getting a fast pass. I think they ran out of Fastpasses at around midday/1pm. The Fastpass machines also give out 'freebies' too!

Food!
Wasn't expensive as we thought it would be! The Mickey Mouse Icecream was about 400yen, but everything else was about what you'd expect. We brought our own food along but ended up eating from Disneyland anyway.

Giftshops!
They get crowded in the afternoon after the afternoon parade - if I'd go again I'd buy earlier in the day.

Bags!
We didn't know how people store bags etc. But all of the rides are pretty harmless (but still good fun). This means that you can take your bags with you on all of the rides.

We were in the Disney Resort the following Saturday but did not go the park. We noted the number of vehicles in the Disneyland parking lots and could see that this is similar to the previous Saturday. So, the park will be equally as crowded.

As per the other parks the food is not that great, but very typical of Disney. We did however find a great Japanese restaurant by the entrance of the park which is much better than burgers and fries.

But if you are an English Speakers like me, you should remind of this.

During my stay, I couldn't find cast members who could speak English at all, except at the Infomation Board of Disney Land. I met a girl (tour guide?)who could speak English fluently.
She was putting a Mickey Mouse shaped ENGLISH PIN on her black costume.

According to her, those few cast members who are putting this English Pin can speak English,and also we can find English and Chinese speakers at the Main Street House at the entrance of the park.

So if you have any questions, you should visit this Information Board(infront of the Pirates of Carribean Attraction) or Main Street House so that you can get some answers.
I had so much trouble before I found her.

the sheer amount of people there was crazy, almost too many I think.
the staff were very friendly and would try to speak English with you.
the cost was as excepted, i would suggest a 2 or 3 day pass just so you could going on the rides even with a fast pass. therefore you would be looking at a few hundred aust dollars just for one person.
Later in the day a typhoon hit closing most rides and leaving us trapped at Disneyland for 8 hours as the trains stop if there is too much wind and this was the main way back to Tokyo. The taxi line was 5 hours long and we were taunted by Disney buses that would only take people between Disneyland, Disneyland hotel and the train station.

3033,Pooh FastPass Required on a Winter Tuesday,"My 12 yr old daughter and I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Tokyo over her school's winter break. Disney Land was a must-see on her list. (Shrines? Museums? forget about it.)

We went on a cloudy, grim Tuesday in February thinking that it would not be crowded. Alas. We did not understand how much the Japanese love their Disney.

The familiarity of the Magic Kingdom/Disneyland experience, viewed through the Japanese lens, was a once in a lifetime opportunity. We spent the day comparing the crowd (the Japanese dress up for the occasion, where as the Florida crowd shows a lot more skin ... not that they should) and the food (curry popcorn!) and the rides. There are a lot more Mickey, Pooh, and Tigger fans and a lot fewer princesses. The Pooh ride is very different than the US versions, highly recommended even if you have to wait in the standby line. ""It's A Small World"" is pretty much the same.

It's not cheap (nothing in Tokyo is) but, based on the crowd, and our experiences over our 10 days there, there is a cultural element that makes it absolutely valuable to visit - particularly when traveling with a tween.","Written April 19, 2012",4.0 of 5 bubbles
3034,Chose wrong time to go...,"We left our hotel in Ueno at 7.30am to get to Disney early to pick up our tickets. We arrived at about 8am to a ""sea"" of people queuing to get in. We eventually got into the park itself at about 9am.

We'd timed our visit so our daughter (who teaches English at Japanese schools) could look after us. It was therefore holiday time, and so the park was at bursting point. They closed the park for entry at about 10am, but they should have done so even earlier as the queues were getting silly. For example there was a 60 minute queue for Small, Small World and it was also about 60 minutes to queue for the Fast Pass tickets for Splash Mountain. There were 30 minute queues for popcorn! As other's have reported some rides were queuing for over 200 minutes.

The park itself was lovely but we'd only managed to get on 3 of the ""bigger"" rides by noon - the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Jungle Cruise. We then stopped for lunch at the Hungry Bear Restaurant and had some very nice curries.

After lunch we switched to the ""smaller"" events and the queues were much smaller - we did ""the Enchanted Tiki Room"", the ""Country Bear Theatre"", the"" Mark Twain riverboat"", and the show at ""Showbase"". After this I'd felt much happier to be doing things rather than just standing in queues.

It did seem that there was a lot of queue jumping taking place, with one person joining the queue for a group and the rest of the family joining them later. I was told that this is the norm in Tokyo Disneyland as the queues are quite often bad and people drop out of the queues to go to rest rooms or get drinks and return, but I think quite a few were being a bit ""naughty"".

By 5pm we'd had enough and escaped back to our hotel.

Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Thunder Mountain, and many familiar rides are located here; but there are Pooh's Hunny Hunt and a Monsters, Inc., ride that are extremely popular. Get your fast passes or you won't get a chance to experience these rides. Captain EO, a 3D film with Michael Jackson is still going strong after 20+ years.

3049,Great day,"My husband and I were in Tokyo the week of Christmas, and as he had never been to a Disney park before, and I'm not a huge hurry to go out of my way to go to Orlando, we decided to spend a day at Tokyo Disneyland. Here are our thoughts!

My #1 piece of advice, if you take nothing else away, is if Disneyland is important to you, be sure to buy your tickets in advance either online if possible or from a Disney store in Japan. We wanted to visit both Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Sea, but when we purchased our tickets several days in advance, Tokyo Sea was already sold out for the days we could possibly make the trip. I'm sure it would have been a very cool park to visit being unique to Japan, but fortunately this didn't ruin our trip. If it's a priority of yours, though, don't skip this step.

My #2 piece of advice: One of the details I missed from others' reviews (and tripadvisor reviews were so helpful so keep reading) is exactly how to use the fast pass. Let me tell you that if you and your friend/spouse/child want to ride together, you need one fast pass per person per ride, not one fast pass per family/group. If you make the mistake we did, having only one fast pass for two people (for lack of English instruction at the fast pass machines--and each ride offering fast passes has fast pass machines in front), we did find a cast member who made an exception and made a written note on my fast pass that it could admit 2. The other thing to note is that you don't have to wait to use your fast pass before you can get another one (maybe this is obvious but I somehow missed it!). For example, if your fast pass says your ride time is 4 pm but it's only 10 am when you get it, you don't have to wait 6 hours to get your next fast pass (at which point they are long gone, anyway), you can have as many on your person at a time so long as you only get one fast pass in an hour. So you if you get your first fast pass at 9:01, you can then get additional fast passes at 10:01, 11:01, etc., regardless of how the ride times are staggered throughout the day.

My #3 piece of advice: Go on an off-peak day. We went during a school day in December--it was the week before Christmas (hence why later in the week was already sold out) but while Japanese schools were still in session and were very pleased with the crowd level. It was also bitterly cold and gray, and I'm sure this contributed to the manageable crowds--and while we weren't exactly comfortable (take gloves!), it made for very short lines (we never waited longer than 30ish minutes) and our mistakes with the fast pass didn't matter.

Other tips:
--If you're cold and don't want Disney-themed gloves/hats/scarves, the cowboy-themed Western Wear store of all places sells non-themed adult winter gear, including plain black and gray 3M therma-lined gloves for men and classic ivory/black/brown women's gloves for about $15/pair.
--They've really cracked down on even mini-tripods like Joby Gorillapods. I was repeatedly lectured in Japanese; I wouldn't try it if I were you.
--Arrive early per other tripadvisor reviews. We were there 45 minutes early and there was already a long queue to enter the park.
--Eating at the quick service restaurants didn't break the bank (less than $20 for 2 people) so I'm glad we didn't bother taking in our own food. However, the popcorn buckets are a total rip off. You still have to pay for refills on top of the exorbitant price of the bucket, and we found we saved money buying individual popcorns throughout the day (the chocolate was our favorite! second favorite soy sauce and butter or something, third favorite caramel).

Going to Japan for the first time I was most excited about Disneyland, but in truth, though we had a great time, it was far from the highlight. Go forth and have fun, but don't sweat the small stuff and don't blow all your money at Disneyland :)","Written February 4, 2012",5.0 of 5 bubbles

Travelled with friends aged 19/20 and we all still loved disneyland! Makes you feel like a child again! We were lucky enough to visit during the Christmas period so there were so many beautiful christmas decorations.

We took a bus from Shinjuku station, the ride was comfortable and it cost us 700yen 1 way. Alot of the rides I must say are more for children. They're weren't many high speed or thrilling rides at all. We loved Splash mountain and our favorite was Space mountain (we went on it twice).

Food is pricey but a range is available. All in all a magical day!

P.S The Turkey leg is overrated! Me and my friends were so excited to try it because of the numerous reviews about how amazing they are on tripadvisor. We were so dissapointed! It tasted plain and smelt bad (probably needed some gravy?) But worth trying yourself, because the line was sooo long and we saw people sitting around eating it ... and nodding in satisfaction??

Look for the roped aff areas out front if you want a calmer interaction. Otherwise, a good park, even if it's not run by Disney.

The Tokyo disneyland has got a lot (i meant really a lot a lot) of fun and activities here...

Those who go with the young kids can rent a stroller from the entrance and don't bother about bringing one!

Also, please make sure you check out the leaflet for the schedule of the street show... these are not to be missed out at all... one advice: please bring your own towel/light picnic carpet so you could have your picnic while watching the show... of course, don't miss out your food and titbits... don't worry, buy from stores along the street...

You should also plan on your journey in the park as some of the attraction has got some specific timing/requirement. Some are kids friendly, some are not. It will be a big waste of time if you think you do not plan ahead of time and randomly selecting your attraction to visit as the park is BIGggg... no kidding.

You should also plan for break along your way but try to avoid the peak hour as every attractions are full of people... and some (actually almost everyone) would require some timing for queuing up....literally 15-2 hours... but you may try to ask for some ""express lane"" ticket before you choose the type of ticket to buy at the entrance... money can drive evil... is definitely true!

Set aside that, the night show is fantastic... with the lighting and music that make it like a wonderland and magic land with all disney characters and special lighting effects...

3066,The most attentive theme park I have been to so far,"The goods:
- Very attentive staff. Have at least 2 staffs in the front of each attraction and more inside. We went on a rainy day and still they put a staff every 50 meters or so out side to accommodate the park goers!
- Most of the park staff speak English and if some of them couldn't, they will get some one that can respond to your question/request right away.
- We went on Thursday, December8, 2011 and the crowd was perfect. Wait time was only 30 max for each ride and NONE on some rides. This was the first time in my Disneyland experience I waited for only 25 minutes to get on Space Mountain!! Not sure if this was because it was raining or Winny the Pooh ride was out.
- Delicious food and snacks throughout the park. Popcorn was on the expensive side but the food we had for lunch and dinner wasn't. It's very comparable for the food we have outside the park.
- We can get on the rides we wanted without having to wait forever. (Average of 15 minutes per ride).
- They let you bring in food and drinks. Not like other Disneyland.
- Very family friendly.

The not so goods:
- Night electric parade was cancelled due to rain.
- A bit chilly (for parents) but my son didn't seem to be affected by it.
- Some rides/attractions narrations were in Japanese.
- Too bright in the ""It's a small world"" ride you can see the ceiling and air ducts inside. Cute dolls as everywhere else but just realized how much difference it was with just lighting adjustment.
- The Winny the Pooh ride (which supposed to be its best ride) was closed.

Conclusions.
- Nice, clean, fun park. Will be back the next time we go back to Japan.

Tips.
- Go on week days to avoid crowd.
- Check weather forecast and go when it's not raining.
- Buy ticket in advance at Disney stores spreading across Tokyo area (you can check the location at Tokyo Disneyland's website) to avoid long lines at entrance booths.","Written December 21, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles

We used the fastpass (which is free!!!) for a few rides but never stood in line for longer than 45 minutes. Everything about Disney is magical and Tokyo did not disappoint!

3069,The Happiest Place in Japan!,"We went to Tokyo Disneyland at a later part of the day, after catching Cirque du Soleil and sunset was early so we mainly enjoyed the park's night atmosphere.

Christmas decorations were out on full force since it's only a month away, and that made for beautiful illuminations all over the park. That alone was something nice to enjoy by itself.

Since we went on a Sunday, the park was understandably packed, and I mean PACKED with visitors. Never underestimate the crowd size when visiting Tokyo Disneyland, lol. In about 6 hours, we managed to get on 4 rides with each averaging a 90-100 minutes waiting time. Having been to Universal Studios Japan, we knew what to expect and so were mentally prepared for the long wait.

The popular Pooh ride was closed for maintenance and I highly recommend would-be visitors to comb through the official site for information on which rides are open etc to avoid disappointment and waste of time running from one side of the park to another. By the way, when we were there only 1 ride had any Fast Pass left at around 3pm, so plan accordingly.

The night parade was beautiful and the fireworks near Cinderella's Castle at the end were a nice touch to end our trip for the day :)

Definitely better than Disneyland Park in LA in terms of maintenance too.","Written December 3, 2011",4.0 of 5 bubbles

Get there early! They only have about five rides that offer fast pass so if you don't get there early (aka 1 hour prior to opening) you will not see a wait shorter than 45 minutes. We got ours to Monsters Inc Ride and Seek and thank goodness we did (it never got under a 3 hour wait the entire time we were there) I highly recomend staying till park close as the park empties out since the monorials stop running back to the city and you can jump on a lot of rides!","Written November 29, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles

My son is 7 yrs old the the majority of attractions were perfect for him. The queues on this day were pretty much non exsistant due to the timing of the reopening and it was a Tuesday.
I had been a few times in years gone by and had struck days where the queuing was at least 2hrs/ ride! This time we arrived at 1pm and had plently of time to do everything we wanted by 9pm. The Electric parade was gorgeous and even though there were no fire works and most of the park was quite dark due to power conservation that only added to the atmoshere.
Well worth the visit and highly recomended!

There are a lot of restaurant and souvenir shops for you to choose at reasonable price. The only thing is everywhere needs to queue, BADLY. The entrance queue was very long, the waiting time for rides ranging from 30-90mnts, and even you have to queue to buy your lunch during peak hour.

Besides, the baby's room is perfect. Someone will assist you, and they even change the mat everytime you're done with changing diapers. They have proper place for you to feed your baby (high chair, colorful room, water dispensers, baby's food and diapers).

But it is recommended that you stay in nearby hotel (disney hotel or official hotels) as you can go back to refresh yourself, and get back in to disneyland within 1/2hour to enjoy your evening parade. Besides, the crowd is much lesser at night, and the queue is much shorter, some of the rides you dont even have to wait!

3079,Halloween at Disneyland!,"Tokyo Disneyland makes quite an impression at halloween! Compared to our summer visit in 2010, with Japan school holidays and the heat and humidity, it was a pleasant change to be there in late October with sunny skies and comfortable weather to enjoy all the many attractions at Disneyland.
Rated as perhaps the best Disney park anywhere, the day we visited the park was crowded and many visitors dressing up for Halloween gave the park a great atmosphere.
The highlights; Disney's Halloween Street ""Welcome To Spookyville"" daytime parade and the 'Dreamlights' electrical parade in the evening.
Both parades were excellent especially the color and lights of the 'Dreamlights' parade.
Taking the walk to all the Disney 'lands' in Adventureland is ""Minnie Oh! Minnie"" at Theatre Orleans. A fast paced musical show with all the stars and Minnie being the star attraction. Presented with Latin music, this is a must on the day's itenerary, fantastic show.
Westernland presents 'Super-Duper Jumpin' Time' at the Plaza Pavillion Bandstand that is a lively and fun show with Mickey and his Disney pals, mainly for the kids.
In Fantasyland don't miss a boat ride through 'It's A Small World...After All."" This is a delight and represents the children of the world in an animated exhibit full of charm and wonderment. Line up to get on a boat was less than ten minutes, the crowd moves rapidly through and no long waiting times, which is a real bonus.
In Toontown, meeting Mickey in his house takes about an hour wait, but once inside the stars house you get to see some old movies he starred in before heading to the backstage area and finally into the film studio dressing room where Mickey..the legend...is waiting. Take photos, have an official one taken as well, there's no rush through and after the long wait, this is worth waiting for.
A ride on the Mark Twain Riverboat was easy and no delays getting aboard for a leisurely trip down the Rivers Of America in Westernland.
The centrepiece in front of Cinderella Castle was decorated with Halloween that had a little spooky feel about them but well done.
During the day parade, ghosts, and spooky creatures appear from the floats to entertain while Mickey leading the parade looks like some sort of Dracula with big cape on.
For evenings at Disney from October onwards take a warm jacket as it tends to get a bit chilly late afternoon.
Souvenir buying is best outside the park in Bon Voyage, where you can buy exactly what is on sale in the park gift stores. However, the park's stores get very crowded and busy, especially after the parades when most visitors are in the Main Street region where the shops are located.
Individual gift stores around the park seem a little less busy.
Centre Street Coffee House provides reasonably priced meals from breakfast to lunch and dinner, the menu changes to suit the time of day. Our breakfast meal consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, complimentary iced water and yoghurt with jam. Not great value for money but nonetheless tasty but not a fan of yoghurt anyway.
Pick up a souvenir bottle of water with Tokyo Disneyland on it... and while baseball caps for adults are not available (this is Disney after all, made for kids!) it's not easy to find any fridge magnets or keyrings either. But there are plenty of other great souvenirs to remember the visit to Disneyland.
Take your place a good half hour before the electrical parade to get a good view, the day parade runs a few times during the day.
Overall great day and as expected no disappointment, for big rides you can use Fast Pass option but main helpful hint is to plan your day when you arrive after getting your guide map and entertainment schedule. Not taking time to go through the guides you'll be totally disappointed to miss something you really want to see or ride on.

She is also very taken with the culture of Japan and would love to be able to visit there more often. All in all a very successful and enjoyable trip.

Read up about going and plan out your day. Always best to arrive early and bring your own lunch. Prices for food are reasonable to slightly expensive so save your money for dinner at the park. (The lines for food can also be very long!)

The ""cast members"" at Tokyo Disneyland are beyond helpful and if it is your birthday, make sure to let the people know at the ticket gate.

They will give you a sticker and every Disney employee who notices will wish you a happy birthday!

Get there early and use the fast passes whenever you can. There is a website for your cellphone in which you can check the queues for each ride. (Not sure if there is English version) Fireworks at night as well as parade are a must see too! Also try your luck for a special show at the lottery place too.

3086,One of the best Disney Parks.. Ever,"I have to admit that i put my visit date as November 2010, but it wouldn't let me set a date any farther back. so.. the story is this...

Since the late 1980's I've been travelling to Japan with Tokyo Disneyland being a must see for most of those numerous trips. I've watched it evolve from one park, to a park and a hotel, to 2 parks, 2 more themed hotels and numerous other things.. like the Ikspiari shopping area.

It is, and always has been, one of the cleanest, friendliest, and easiest Disney park to get around. I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim lots of times, and to Walt Disney World in Florida too. My absolutely favorite is still Tokyo. The park layout is similar their American Cousins, but for some odd reason, seems to work better as far as guests trying to get around the park.

The attractions are definitely different from the ones in the U.S. In particular, Pooh's Hunny Hunt at Tokyo Disneyland is 100 times more fun than the ones in the U.S. Between the trackless system, to hunny pots that spin and whirl around each other, to bouncing up and down with tigger, it's fun for kids of all ages.. While the wait time can be long at times ( if you want a fast pass, go first thing in the morning), but it's definitely worth it. It's one of the only rides that my older aunt will ride. She loves it!

Then you have the food, and the shopping. Their food selections are more widely varied than at other disney parks. You still have your turkey legs, and pizza, but they have other items too... peanut butter and jelly sandwich meals and such. Some of these you can purchase in a souvenir lunch box.. The character goods seem to be cuter, and have more variety in Tokyo than anywhere else.

And of course.. I can't forget popcorn! They have so many different flavors it's crazy.. So far we've come across curry, strawberry, capuccino, chocolate, sea salt, pepper, honey, etc. All were good and the popcorn buckets are cute!!

By far, Tokyo Disneyland is one of my favorite Disney parks. If you have to see one park aside from Disneyland in Anaheim, I'd say this is it.","Written October 5, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3087,Best theme park anytime!,"This is one place where I went in 2 of the 4 trips I made to Japan last year. Really well organised and certainly the happiest place on earth! My advice for 1st timers is that you have to decide in which order you want to organise your programme once inside the theme park. That is deciding between parades, shows and rides. There is usually 2 parades, one in the daytime and one at night, both are very different and are must see events. Take note of the times for these which are clearly stated on the pamphlets. Then note the showtimes for the more classic shows like Minnie Oh Minnie! You can then use the time in between to do your favourite rides. Be sure to wait at the entrance at about 230pm, where alot of the Disney characters are actually near the main entrance posing for photos. Leave shopping to the very last - it's just not worth carrying all your shopping bags thru'out with you the whole day. There's a fireworks display at night as well but this may not happen if the weather is not favourable.","Written October 5, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3088,Fantastic day out for the young at heart,"We have been to four other Disney parks (USA x 2, Paris and HK) and although Tokyo Disney is huge and has everything you can possibly ask for in terms of rides, it is not really set up for foreigners. This is evident in the fact that all the shows (and we love the shows!) are in Japanese, all ride instructions in Japanese, ATM's don't accept foreign cards. Disappointing for such a huge set up like Disney. Incredibly long hot and exhausting wait times for rides with a phenomenal amount of people streaming through the gates. God Bless fast passes, only down side is that of course, you can only have one per person at any given time. And, merchandising in the myriad of stores, was very weird. No Tink stuff! She has been banished! Plenty to purchase of many of the other Disney characters but some significant absences which made my kids a bit sad! Pricey but worth going, we got a three day pass through our hotel (Hilton Tokyo Bay) which was much cheaper than the price quoted on the website.

1. If you are staying in Shinjuku, buy your entry passes at the Takashimaya Times Square Disney Store and avoid the queues.

2. Yes, yes, yes - get there early and use Fast Passes.

3. Don't think it will be quiet just because it is a bit rainy and a weekday.

4. Even if you are adult, do the Winnie-the-Pooh Hunny Hunt ride, it is unique to Tokyo Disneyland and well worth it.

5. If you are English speakers (like us) don't bother with the translator screens if you are doing the Tiki Room - it just distracts you from the the cool stuff going on.

3091,Spend your money somewhere else,"My Husband and I went to Disneyland in Tokyo. It was amazing.

Three things to know before you go:

-Wear proper shoes! I can't stress this enough.
-Go as a ""Single Rider"" and you will wait 20 minutes instead of 2 hours!
-Get your Fast Passes as soon as you can!

I would suggest reading your Map as soon as you get in to see which rides don't allow single riders, and get the Fast Passes for those as soon as possible. If you don't care about sitting beside the person that you are with, you can go down the ""Single Rider"" lanes and save yourself an hour or two PER RIDE! Unfortunately we didn't know about this until the next day when we went to Disney Sea, but it made our day there a million times better.

This park is amazing, and if you follow the three things mentioned above, it will be a perfect day!

The food is of course really expensive, but fantastic quality.

The rides are all in Japanese, but that just adds to the experience of being in Japan :) You can still catch what's going on.

Get there early! and if you can afford it, stay in the Disney Hotel. We didn't and by the end of the day you are so tired, the last thing you want to do is make your way back to your hotel, although the trains are easy to get around.

The people were friendly - both the guests and workers. A lot of rides are in Japanese, but of course, it didn't matter. A must-see for any Disney fan!

3095,Today is a fantasy,"3 chilling rides were closed on the day I visited disneyland. One thing to remember, get the fast pass once you enter. To note: many people will be rushing for it.

The fast pass allows you to play a ride without queuing up in the specific timing stated on the ticket. It's free. So no worries that you have to pay additional charges for it. Once you get the fast pass of one ride, you will have to wait for about an hour or so to be eligible for another fast pass. Getting the fast pass helps in such a way that you need not queue for some rides however, it's impossible to get the fast pass for ALL rides. So eventually, there will be 1 or 2 rides that you would have to stand in the queue.

Overall, some rides are thrilling and some are enjoyable except for one, Captain EO if I'm not wrong. It's this 4D screening about Michael Jackson and I see that most of the people fell asleep halfway through.

Remember to try the turkey leg located between Westernland and Critter Country. Everyone will be holding it and eat while walking. Remember to note the afternoon parade and night parade timing so that you need not contemplate whether to give up queuing to watch the parade or to continue queuing. Watching of the parade is a must in Disneyland as that's the only time you see all the disney characters. The night and day parade has different concept so it's still worth it to stay till 8pm to catch the night parade.

The pizza bar is rather popular and its taste is good.

Do pray for less wind so that there will be fireworks display in the night.

3096,Find Your Inner Mickey/Minnie,"Best to buy your ticket beforehand as there are long queues at the counter. Check the internet on where to buy them. Go in the morning when the gates open and obtain a map of the place. My advice is to pick the rides that you would really like to go on because seriously, you will not be able to go on all the rides due to hours and hours of waiting to get on. Many Japanese youngsters have unlimited-entries-in-a-year tickets which they really make full use of. And these are the ones who make up the bulk of the visitors milling around Disneyland. Be prepared to stand in line for up to two hours for a popular ride! The best thing to do is to go on those ones first like roller coasters or the Monsters Inc ride. If you leave them till later, your chances of getting on them are almost nil! This is due to the fact that there are early passes that one can obtain. Sorry I cannot remember the term for it but you can obtain a pass which will schedule you for a later time to go on a particular ride (the machine dispensing it is setup outside each ride). At least you know you won't really have to queue for that one! Leave the shopping till later since the shops will be there the whole time. Do look out for souvenirs like chopsticks and rice moulds that can only be bought in Tokyo Disneyland. No other Disneyland will have those items.

Main Street actually has a ""roof"" to protect you from the rain and sun, which is awesome! But the lands themselves are pretty similar, although the wait time was averaging 100 minutes for everything, even kiddie rides. ToonTown was bigger than the one in Florida and had some extra things, including Roger Rabbit's Toon Spin ride or something like that. I didn't get to go cuz of the wait time, but I'm sure it was fun. Space Mountain was closed, but I would have waited to go on that. I did go on Splash Mountain - one of my favorite rides of all time! As a side note, getting here from Tokyo is easy - there is a train station right outside the park. The Tokyo Disneyland hotel is also right there and it is GORGEOUS! It's huge and so beautiful - if you can stay there, you should!","Written July 8, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3099,"Amazing park, only overshadowed by sister park next door!","Take all of the Magic Kingdom's across the world, pull out the best stuff (rides, staff, food, etc.) and put it together. Bam! You've got Tokyo Disneyland! Seriously, great park a must visit even if you've been to other Disney's or not a huge Disney fan.

Tip - Do the Winnie the Pooh ride. Even if not a Winnie the Pooh fan the ride will blow you away!","Written July 8, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3100,Wow!!!,"Actually, seems like all the Disneyland have the same rides. So this trip is more for the kids.

Since I have mentioned that all the Disneylands have similar rides, so what make Tokyo Disneyland stands out?

It is the Japanese culture and hospitality.

I am not saying other Disneylands staff is rude or bad but Japan has brought Disney hospitality to a new level. Staff is polite and the park is very clean. I would even say that it is spotless.

All rides are well maintained and staff is helpful. Disneyland is more suitable for small kids. If you have older kids and are adventurous enough, I heard Disney sea have more thrilling rides.

Try to be there as early as possible so you will have more time to explore this huge park.","Written June 28, 2011",4.0 of 5 bubbles
3101,Disney Magic!,"I got all the things that I expected from Disneyland. Nice, fun, kid-safe rides and of course, really long lines. Although there are some rides that I liked, I still prefer the nearby Disneysea.","Written June 11, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3102,Unforgettable night parade!,"Very lovely place for families and kids. Be indulged in the lovely world in this disneyland! I felt that I'm in a fairy tale land when visiting this disneyland! All the rides are suitable for all ages. I just can't forget the night parade there, so beautiful and nice with their lights! The service there is so wonderful! Needless to say, the place is very clean and you can book your own seat on the floor while waiting for the night parade to start! People there were very co-operative and considerate when watching the night parade. Wonderful place to be at.","Written April 25, 2011",4.0 of 5 bubbles
3103,Good...not great. queuing could be improved,"The rides here are not good - think alton towers ten / fifteen years ago, and the queues are quite bad. The queues to get in are the worst though, as the system simply doesn't seem to make any sense and they move people to different queues for unknown reasons. we arrived at 8:50 and didn't enter the park until 9:40. a previous traveller said to make sure you get a map in english at the gates - good call! everywhere else the maps are japanese. the shows etc are also in Japanese, but still enjoyable, and dont require queueing for ages!
They have a fast pass system, but often there is a 30 min queue just for that, but this is better than the 1 hour minimum queue for the smaller rides and a 2/3 hour wait for the larger ones.
They have a lot of staff, and the place is spotless, perhaps more people could be used to entertain the queues!
the Japanese seem to LOVE so sit to be entertained, and they spread out mats along the parade route an HOUR before it starts...i wouldn't worry, there are plenty of vantage points, and the parades are great - the highlight of the day.
i would suggest taking food with you, as it is very pricey.

overall a good day, but if you want to go on all the rides you will need more than 1 day and a LOT of patience. ( i went on a Thursday, off peak season no holidays etc and it was still busier and the queues were worse than a school holiday weekend at alton towers!)

worth a visit, but this is my first disney experience and i wont be planning another one for a good while!","Written February 24, 2011",4.0 of 5 bubbles
3104,awesome family experience,"We spent one day at Tokyo Disneyland last summer with two small children (3 and 5). We had a great time and will definitely visit again.

It's important to buy tickets in advance and - if you want the most ouf of your day - arrive at least an hour before they open. You'll see a line-up already! Make a plan, check the rides and the map, once they open the door the crowd will be overwhelming, but if you run, you can get to your favourite ride with no need to wait. From that point, expect 1-2 hours wait for the popular rides. We had an exact plan what we wanted to try, one of us lined-up and the other went around with the kids to meet the characters in the park. My kids got to meet all princesses and the crowd around them wasn't as bad as it was around Mickey and Minnie Mouse. To meet Mickey, we had to wait more than 2 hours.
If you want to watch shows, make sure to be there very early, all sitting and standing places fill up quick. Most people bring a mat to sit to watch shows and the parade.","Written February 21, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3105,Perfect day out for all ages,"This is definitely worth a visit if you are going to Tokyo. There are only a few big rides, but there is plenty to see and do. The Perfect day out.","Written February 5, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3106,Fantastic!,"There is Magic in every corner of Tokyo Disneyland!! Spend here a day or more, to get a bit away from the big city rush, and fell like a kid. The kids will love it. I did not mention big differences between tokyo disneyland and paris disneyland, to be honest. What impressed me in tokyo disneyland was how extremely clean was everywhere.","Written January 30, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3107,Plenty of Disney Magic - plus great people watching,"Visited Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea over 3 days in late September. Had a brilliant time. The rides have all the typical Disney magic you would find in Orlando and the people are fun to watch (people in matching Disney outfits, big groups with mouse ears and Mickey gloves - has to be seen to be beleived). The Disney Halloween celebrations (Parades, shows) had kicked off already and those were as good as the rides. Overall if you love Disney parks you'll love this one. Just be sure to go mid-week to avoid crowds. The only negative we found at all was that the food was a bit off our tastes. You either have Western junk food or it seems you get stuff smothered in Teriyaki sauce.","Written January 22, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
3108,Don't bother. A waste of money.,Crowds were appalling. On average a 2-3hour wait for each ride. No fastpasses available. Children only went on 4 rides all day. (9am - 10pm). Very expensive. Very little inside seating for dinner. Children also do not rate this as a highlight of their trip. (Ages 9 and 10).,"Written January 7, 2011",1.0 of 5 bubbles
3109,"Great day with kids, week day, not school holidays!!!!","Our family of 2 Adults and 3 children between 11-15yrs thoroughly enjoyed our day at Tokyo Disneyland. We are not fanatical about Disney stuff but had thought it was worth it for our three kids. We got there at about 9am after catching a JR train easily (ask your accomodation) which took us directly to Tokyo Disneyland. We had pre-purchased tickets so didn't have to queue to buy. (We purchased our tickets at Takashimaya in Shibuya)

WEEKDAYS ONLY!
Firstly I would say (and I think other reviews support this) do not go on a weekend or during Japan's school holidays and expect an easy day of this theme park. We went on a week day during winter before school holidays and waited between 5min and 40mins for rides which we were very happy with.

RIDES
Thundermountain and Spacemountain were the kids favorites, Poohbear's hunny hunt and Splash mountain were also good although the poohbear ride is obviously for younger children. Get your brochure when you go in and look for the rides which have fast passes and plan your day. We had a good hour out for lunch and still managed to get on Thundermountain and Spacemountain twice! I wouldn't advise doing the evening pass, you need a day to do everything without stress. The haunted house was themed with Tim Burton's nightmare before Xmas which we enjoyed but apparently the attraction changes from time to time and is not always as good. I wouldn't bother with Star Wars or unless you have time, it's not a genuine ride and uses old technology but it was mildly entertaining.

FAST PASSES
Check the website or your brochure for fast pass rides. They are free of charge unlike Universal Studios. The staff will show you how to use them by inserting your passport ticket into the fast pass machine to redeem the fast pass at the attraction of your choice. Not a 100% sure but I think the fast passes are valid after 3pm but cannot be redeemed after 3pm. Check with staff on these times, there are some english speakers who can advise you.

FOOD
We bought onigiri (rice balls) in a cooler bag for the morning which are very cheap to buy from the local stores. For lunch we ate at the buffet restaurant which cost us about $20 a head. Not the cheapest I admit but we were unlikely to be back with the kids in the near future. It wasn't a bad western style feed with a smattering of japanese, we left with full tummy's. My husband loved the churros, which are available near spash mountain and other spots which were clearly marked on the brochure map.

SOUVENIRS
There are a ton of souvenir shops, many with the same stuff as the previous one. We bought lots of little gifts and even though it was coming up to Xmas, there were many items discounted, on special or on clearance - look out for these as there were some good bargains on quality items.

PHOTOS
There are rules about tripods - you aren't allowed to take them. This made taking family photos a bit hard. I noticed some of the asian tourists (not sure which nationality) brought mini tripods which I probably would have risked if I had one.

PARADES
The parades were fun and colourful, little kids would just love them. Be aware that if you are trying to get to a ride the parades can divert you so check the times and plan ahead, so you don't miss out on a ride or miss a fast pass time.

TOILETS
Clean western style, but busy even on a good day. We didn't encounter Japanese style but had heard from others that some were Japanese style.

Overall I would recommend Tokyo Disneyland to those who love Disney or have kids, just don't expect a great experience if you go during peak periods. Enjoy!","Written January 4, 2011",5.0 of 5 bubbles
