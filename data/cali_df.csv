0,"Rude staff, overall enjoyable",generally good of course it would be but i was surprised that many of the workers were very rude with us sure the ones who are supposed to play evil characters it makes sense and it s funny but i was surprised that not once but multiple times there were multiple crew members who acted and spoke very rudely with my cousins and me also most lines were over an hour or more long but that s to be expected best way to solve that would probably be to limit the tickets sold per day but that would probably raise ticket prices so who knows the only reason i gave it a star is because i m a star wars fan and i loved galaxy s edge,4,2022-05-08
1,Loved it!,i go to disneyland every couple of years or so it has always been a star experience except for today it just felt more like a chore today that special feeling wasn t there i encountered employees that were short with guests on numerous occasions today yelling at guests in line over the pa system because they had not seen the line move talking back to guests in the past they have been much more patient i think also there is a misrepresentation of minorities when it comes to the cast members prices are high but that s expected we won t be back for a long time better to try one of the other theme parks in the area ,5,2022-05-06
2,Lacking. Changing for the worse.,had a great time here i enjoyed this park better the wdw can t wait to go back it was a great time and i had a lot fun i was when i went ,3,2022-05-05
3,My first time and I loved it!!,i was at the park the other week and i was on my way to one of the rides and i was attacked verbally by a employee they offended me by saying things about my lgbtq son who is only years old and things about my hair and my fur suit i am really offended ,5,2022-05-04
4,terreable,we were fortunate enough to take our year old it was our first time being here and i honestly did not see the magic everyone talks about and rarely saw any characters walking around the one thing my daughter wanted to do was see the princesses although she did enjoy what she saw the whole thing lacked all the magic i heard about it i was not aware that the princesses were only there from and not all of them are always there so if your little one is looking to meet a specific one they may be disappointed the cast members running these lines are not very friendly super short which is unfortunate i am sure they get tired with all the people they deal with there was an older gentleman each time we went diff days and he was answering in only yes or no and felt like pulling teeth at some point i did have to laugh a little as the chaos around here is on another level and it sure is not the happiest place on earth ha this place is mostly designed for adults and older kids imo i think we paid too much for the tickets for what we got out of it with that being said we did have more pleasant experiences with most employees than not i hope they get paid well the bippity boppity boutique was was the only place i feel i didn t waste my money ,1,2022-05-03
5,It's ok,it was my first time last sunday at disneyland and as i studied tourism management it was always my dream to work there once however i am glad i never did as the whole experience was so disappointing all the rides are so old break down all the time and the staff is so unfriendly this is certainly not what i expect when i pay usd per person and kid we went last sunday to disneyland with our little kids luckily we got genie fast tickets otherwise we would not have been able to ride a lot however all the little kids rides like tea part dumbo alice peter pan do not have fast lanes so it makes actually no sense to buy genie for little kids however for the first ride i waited min with my son for rise of the resistence only that it is breaking down while we are on the ride we got fast lane tickets to come back later but as everybody got it it of course took over min on the fast lane later as well a friend who is going to disneyland all the time was kind of shocked when i told him that we did not got fast passes for everywhere for the whole day which was common a few years ago as we wasted hours for not beeing able to ride ride of the resistence when we wanted to do the rider switch at thounder mountain it was broken down as well and when we were riding space mountain it broke down while we were on the ride the staff even had to push us to the station the kids were scared from the dark and a broken down ride and the worst was that there was never an apology or anything not even an offer to ride it again and even with genie you can only do each ride once in the fast lane also buzz lightyear s space ranger spin and splash mountain broke down when we were on it is nice that genie pass includes all pictures for free however there was barely a chance to take pictures my kids wanted to take pictures with minnie and mickey mouse but this park area was under construction there was a min queue for princess pictures and on rides only space mountain and splash mountain took pictures furthermore i was very shocked by the none existence of staff training like nobody heard before of creatina a positive customer experience we went for lunch to naples while we were still waiting for our pizza my husband got bis ordered gnocchi but no cuttlery was on the table he had to wait and we even had to ask for it we bought icecream next to autopia i bought the frozen banana which shows on the pictures with just black chocolate around the sales person even told us if it is fine with nuts yes i am fine with all kind of nuts but not peanuts so why can she not say its with penanuts i would have never bought this the worst staff experience was shortly before the parade min before the start they told us we should go away cause all the spots are taken and we can not watch it we should come back hours later with our little kids seriously i do not unterstand why people are not allowed to stand behind the people sitting on the seats there would have been enough space they just did not let us go there it should not be surprising that everybody wants to see the parade why is your car management better than crowd management covid spread prevention measurements are all out of place you can barely find hand sanitizer nobody wears a masked and when queuing or on the rides of course you can not keep a distance also pricing wise i do not understand why they charge full price for kids above our year old is so litte she is under and was not allowed on many of the rides it would definitely be more fair if pricing is not according to age but according to the kids height ,3,2022-05-02
6,"Not worth the money, rides broken down all the time",we had a really good time there but there were times where the price we paid really was not justified you have to be really early like ish to be right at the front of entrance but they have the rope midway in the park and that makes an enormous amount of people to queue altogether all at once then you frantically get to the ride rise of resistance for us and as we got there ride was not working from the very beginning of the day and that was not the only one about of them were broken luckily we stayed in the queue and after about mins waiting we managed to do it and it was unbelievably mind blowing the new genie plus system is ok but really another way of extracting money from you and not giving you more perks than the old free fast pass was saying that we managed to do a few rides on genie plus in the morning but comes ish you are then looking at late afternoon to book rides park is very busy didn t feel like they were working on restricted number but we did have lots of fun and loved the star wars area pirates of caribbean is currently under renovation and unfortunately the blue bayou restaurant was partially closed and surrounded by a wall so we cancelled our reservation which was done ages ago the other annoying thing is that you are ending up being glued on your phone trying to book stuff app freezes a lot and we started to run out of battery and there was nowhere to recharge and without a phone you really struggle to know what s happening they need to sort the app out and give free charging points to people ,1,2022-04-28
7,Live experience no longer there,fun fun fun it is really the happiest place on earth we took the entire family of we all had a marvelous time ,3,2022-04-28
8,No longer the happiest place on Earth,old dated all the good rides keep breaking down even in the quiet season the lines are an hour long for those rides still operating at one point space mountain star tours haunted mansion star wars matterhorn bobsleds and pirates of the caribbean were all out of action in the middle of the day people were all standing around not sure what to do funny how the shops and eateries never break down the gouging continues because their prices have gone up and you now have to pay extra for the replacement of the previously free fastpass system and the replacement isn t as good you are now expected to use an online map on your teeny tiny phone screen instead of giving a paper map to all guests and your tickets are online and they photo you on entrance which slows the lines down they open the gates before advertised start time but only the shops are open the rides areas remain blocked off until the stroke of opening time bad luck if your phone battery dies during the day no more map nowhere to charge up yes their crowd management is still superb the park is uber clean but with such high prices no rides no parade its awful value and we had a miserable miserable time wait another years before you go it might be ok then ,1,2022-04-24
9,Unhappiest Place on Saturday,the last time i was at disney was and i used to live in socal blasphemy i know this was the first time my daughter went to disney so it was a big deal we bought tickets at a local military base since my husband is retired military if you are military i highly recommend getting your tickets at your local base you save quite a bit we did a day pass park per day security and ticket checks were a breeze we waited no longer than minutes it was quite busy at am but the employees are efficient i love the disney app that shows you maps of the park wait times for the rides nearest bathrooms performance times etc prices for food are still crazy overpriced so it s highly recommended to bring your own lunches and snacks water fountains aren t as readily available so map those out early and top up whenever you see one the wait lines weren t too terrible the longest we waited was hour for the new star wars ride and that s because we got lucky when it reopened the average wait time was minutes for that ride it could be much better the actors are overly focused on the color you stood on at the beginning of the experience and then making people move around if they don t sit in the right colored seat massive waste of time honestly unless you re a big star wars fan it wasn t worth the wait pirates of the caribbean was closed for refurbishment splash mountain kept shutting down so we didn t get to ride it overall the ride situation was better at disneyland than california adventure rides not worth more than minute wait star wars new ride any of the fair rides like dumbo tea cups etc the second day we did california adventure we arrived by am and it was the same as the previous day in terms of wait and numbers of people the brisket fries they had for the wine fest were delicious overall the food choices here were better than disneyland the ghiradelli store had tasty frappes and they offer a military discount improvements that need to be made are rides closed for maintenance and constant shut downs at one point there were rides shut down at the same time this isn t cool especially for people who travel out of state and out of country to visit disney and only have days to spend at the park also the number of people they let in for the lightning pass compared to people waiting in line is total garbage i counted on the monsters inc ride they let in lighting passes and people in the regular line up what a joke disney makes a ton of money as it is stop being greedy eliminate the lightning line and make everyone wait in the same line rides not worth more than minute wait grizzly falls monsters inc junkyard junkers zephyr next visit we ll likely skip disney and do universal studios ,2,2022-04-23
10,"Wait another 10 years before you go, it might be ok then. Now, its rubbish.",it s all about the genie rip off and causes so many issues can only book one ride and then wait maybe hours before your next slot genie makes stand by lines impossible and slow the quality attention to detail and benefits of disney have been decimated and there is only one reason for that people will still turn up but prepare to pay for it and what a shame disney is now more focused on its profit margin you can still do quality of service and experience and still have a very healthy profit ,1,2022-04-23
11,Fun But Greed is Ruining the Experience,i have been going to disneyland for over years and i have to say this was probably my last trip the place has just gone downhill i completely understand posting or rides under maintenance but to have yes rides breakdown on you while you are there for a day visit is just horrible all of these rides were on our lightning passes which of course when we reached out to disney and they didn t care and had no plans to give you the refund we paid for this monster s inc we actually were walked off of the ride mid ride yep lights came on and we were ushered off no sorry or anything jungle cruise we broke down and had to wait on the boat for minutes until it started up again haunted mansion splash mountain and peter pan all stopped while on ride as well while waiting over an hour in line star wars rise of the resistance they shut down for the rest of the night the others that shut down while standing in line were cars big thunder soaring splash mountain the nd time the plus side were the photographers they were very nice shooting photos the food however is average and over priced but that is expected just very sad to see disney go downhill you can see several youtube videos with others saying the very same thing customer service is not a priority here anymore ,3,2022-04-21
12,$$$$$$$,we were very disappointed firstly the genie that we purchased disappointed as one can only setup an appointment one at a time we waited hours for our indiana jones ride only to have it temporarily go down at that point we could book another ride but some of them were for hours in the future they didn t even guarantee that we go on indiana jones after it opened so we missed out we were not impressed with the star wars rides the rise of thr resistance simply shuffled us from one room to another for most of the ride very disappointing if you want to go on rides don t go to disneyland if you want to pay exorbitant prices for clothes and memorabilia disneyland is your place if you want to spend on a coke or ounces of lemonade then disneyland is your place otherwise universal studios is great and so is legoland for the young set ,2,2022-04-20
13,Last trip-- Quality has gone in the dumpster!,excellent very generous breakfast at the carnation cafe great staff there too guests were in great moods and very polite to each other of guests were not wearing masks at all but no one hassled anyone else about mask no mask genie worked well and is worth the mobile orders from the disney app is an excellent way to save time and hassle getting food,1,2022-04-19
14,Disappointing,i have been coming with my family every year for many years now used to new experiences and top quality in everything this year we come back very disappointed the ticket cost raised considerably the new genie is far from working fine we payed for having an app that needs to be rebooted every time not showing our reservations well not showing attraction times etc you pay for lighting lane and when you get there at your time yo still have to make a minute line of every attractions were temporarily closed for malfunction we have never had too many attractions failing the same day loosing or next appointments not being able to schedule the next one or stuck for several minutes many spots only accept app purchases on an app that doesn t works food quality is not the same as before incredible that even if you pay for genie you still have to pay for lighting lane at the main attractions and having to make a min line after malfunctions in them so much diversity does not represents most of the families specially in merchandise surprisingly we saw many staff members not so friendly a bit stressed and angry ,2,2022-04-17
15,Love Disneyland,disneyland park was very enjoyable as well as california adventure at disney our family had a terrific time and this was our second visit with young kids we went during the food and wine festival which was also great ,5,2022-04-15
16,"Pixar pier was amazing, Disneyland Nostalgic but like Disney World better",if you are over or have difficulty walking get a scooter it was a tremendous help morning hours are the best time to ride the popular rides if you can afford it get the genie for the lightening lanes it will save you a lot of time and ensure you get to ride your favorites especially when you are on a tight schedule cast was friendly food was good ,5,2022-04-15
17,Spring Break,go back to walt disney s values disney magic is completely gone they can t stay neutral on politics there an amusement park not a political entity iam done they are on the wrong side of what s right and decent what a shame i will hold onto my childhood memories i used to love going to disneyland they have disappointed on so many levels from pricing to all the ridiculous politically correct changes they have done to rides the same sticks and stones may break my bones but names can never hurt me that s not a lie anymore now if you say anything it apparently urch worse than getting a broken leg no more annual passes for us we re gonna spend our money elsewhere sad very sad ,4,2022-04-14
18,"Lines, lines and more lines",there s a lot of planning on the front end with the launch of the app genie and lightening lane but if you take the time to properly plan and stay in the park disneyland hotel is excellent the experience really is magical and so much fun paying extra to do the star wars ride is so worth it it s incredible definitely don t miss splash and space mountain rides know that the photos from the rides are no longer walk up for prints but rather take a photo of the code on the monitor to upload on your phone via genie we ate churros a number of times the best otherwise napoli in downtown disney was excellent for lunch goofy s kitchen is great for the experience but the food buffet is meh and you pay easily ,2,2022-04-14
19,Done with Disney,visited anaheim disneyland april we re a family of disney fanatics and have been many times before covid we found the park much changed disney is limiting the amount of guests make sure you have reservations before going there a one day one park ticket varies in cost depending when you go to avoid standing in long ride lines you need to purchase genie service for an extra per person we had in our party for an additional above the park tickets genie service works similar to the old fast pass tickets which were free the new star wars ride cost an additional per person if you want to ride it table service restaurants get booked months in advance if you can t get a reservation you take a chance of going on a wait list do that when you first arrive for the best chance for a table service restaurant you are required to hold the reservation with a credit card no shows lose the holding fee the other options are fast foods burgers pizzas etc we found the majority of disney cast members cold they did their job and that s it the happy smiling faces are gone i believe part of this is they re overworked and paying guests are unable to get the service they once did so disney cast members get the heat not sure if disney world is experiencing the same issues yes we used to go there once a year too but anaheim disney isn t the park we once knew would we go back probably but only when we have out of town visitors who always ask to go but to go regularly as we once did no not until disney stops nickel and diming visitors and gets organized hopefully now that the pandemic is behind us disney will get back to being the happiest place on earth rather than the priciest place on earth ,1,2022-04-13
20,"Tons of fun, and perhaps unexpectedly",started off bad the website would not work for me after hours of trying everything i could i ended up calling the help desk i forgot the person s name that helped me but she was the best experience i had with disneyland she spent hours helping me and finally success she was very nice patient kind and helpful she gets an a in my book and deserves a reward she represented disney well why i couldn t have her book for me is beyond me what a stupid system disneyland itself was disappointing last time we went was about years ago many of the rides were jolting far from smooth that can give whiplash they would have been fun if the rides were smoother but after of those rides we stopped picking the thrill rides a surprising of the rides were broke throughout the day night the good thing was both the public and disney staff were nice and helpful a couple gave us tips on how to use genie and waiting in lines it was nice talking with people no one we met was grouchy and anytime we needed assistance and asked staff questions they were surprisingly happy and helpful i suspect they get millions of questions a day and the way they responded to us was as if we were the first to ask them for help the staff all deserve kudos the web site deserves an f and the thrill rides get a d f for how choppy the ride was and how they kept breaking down waiting another years will be fine with me ,5,2022-04-12
21,Worth the visit,we couldn t get tickets as it was a late decision we kept refreshing the disney website for days till we got adventure park tickets tried all day to convert to hopper but couldn t the adventure park closed early that day at so on the way out tried one more time to get hopper and we got them so we had hrs to enjoy it we had genie so we were able to do about rides which was beyond my expectations cast members were also very kind in letting my kids in at in the genie even though it was not available on the app it is smaller than disney world so you are able to move from land to land quickly,5,2022-04-08
22,Fancy World for Kids and Adults alike!,my kids my wife and i enjoyed every moment of the day except for the long lines do your family and yourself a favor and just by the lighting lane pass it definitely worth every penny,5,2022-04-05
23,They care about money more than their customers.,i accidentially double purchased already over priced tickets for my family and spent hours same day on hold pleading with various people to refund one set of tickets they refused and just kept repeating their policy that the tickets are non refundable i have no respect for an organization that refuses to hear out its customers and have any flexibility from their rigid policy there is almost no other industry that works this way even airlines always let you cancel purchased flights within hours ,1,2022-04-05
24,"Rising prices, lowering standards",with ticket prices so high i expected good service sadly the higher prices accompany lower park quality litter on the streets seems to have i creased restrooms have wet floors not from recent cleaning the park has funky smells that do not enhance the experience the nee lower standards for employees seem to have lowered the level of frienlyness and competence i have gone to disneyland almost every year i expected better i hope they can get it back together ,1,2022-04-02
25,Sad cash grab,after many years of truly magical vacations at disney world we spent for two of us at disneyland including park hopper and genie and it was the single worst disney experience we ve ever had the new system doesn t work we spent the entire day standing in lines thanks to the new system recently discontinued single rider lines and the fact that disneyland crams the entire universe into one park with no hope of having less than a one hour wait sometimes hours even though we arrived at the park an hour before opening we will never ever go there again ,2,2022-03-31
26,New system DOES NOT WORK-miserable experience and $$$$$,my family adults and children spent a week in la for spring break i booked four disneyland single park tickets with genie a month in advance we spent hours am to pm in the park and were not able to see everything we wanted to but had a lot of fun the park was clean but very crowded even with genie we waited in many long lines the food was okay but very expensive overall a positive experience but we enjoyed our day at universal studios more ,1,2022-03-30
27,Not so magical,i love disneyland the cleanliness creativity attention to detail and exceptional customer service a bit disappointed that the genie plus service does not include all high activity rides and that a lightning lane is required for the ride with the longest wait that would have resulted in an additional on top of our base tickets and genie plus service i would recommend alloting more than a day to be able to enjoy all that the park has to offer trying to squeeze everything in a day was a bit tiring and overwhelming especially on the high volume day we attended ,2,2022-03-30
28,"Still Magic, But Much Room for Improvement",disneyland is still a wonderful and magical experience they re masters of crowd control even when it seems overwhelmingly crowded the rides are amazing at still bring joy to many age groups the new star wars area of the park is incredible and really transports you to that world the park is still spotless everywhere you go which is very nice there are some places where disneyland could improve plastic waste there was so much plastic waste within the park that was really disturbing to see on such a massive scale disneyland could be a leader with it s reach in doing away with single use plastics at their parks why not use composable vessels for all the food that is served throughout the park political social statements on clothing i saw so many disturbing political and pro gun statements on clothing at the park have a dress code at your park if someone has a shirt advocating gun violence at a park for families make them cover it up maintaining the rides during our day trip we had a lot of issues with rides being down at one time or another in one day we experienced delays due to rides being down at the following rides big thunder mountain pirates indiana jones space mountain jungle cruise haunted mansion rise of the resistance toy story midway mania and the incredicoaster when one of these popular rides goes down it increases the the wait time at another ride when multiple top attractions go down it causes a real problem these were all just temporary but they were on top of permanent closures of attractions like toon town and grizzly river run being closed for refurbishment healthy eating for god sake just offer a place with some healthy meal options disneyland is in southern california home to some of the best farmland in the entire country but try finding some fresh fruit or low sugar options to eat for a snack sugar is great for a treat but just give us something good to eat ,3,2022-03-28
29,Fantastic just isn't a strong enough word!,what can you say disneyland is the place to go we took advantage of the genie app and ordered meals ahead of time checked ride wait times and scheduled our day ,5,2022-03-26
30,Walt would be sad....,let me start off by saying i m a huge disneyland fan ive been going for over years i get excited every time i get to take my grandchildren and i was excited taking my children and i was excited when i was a kid ok so first don t go if you don t pay for the genie plus service it will be a very frustrating day second be aware there will be extra charges for some of the premium rides sooo you will be out an extra dollars per person if you want to ride everything and not be in line all day and that amount is on top of very high ticket cost by the way that is per day for genie per person dollars to ride new star wars ride dollars for spiderman per person and dollars for cars ride per person i elected to stand in the normal line for the cars ride and they literally let people go for every forty people that paid the bucks so it was a long wait and kind of frustrating it seems like disney is kind of separating people by their social standing if you cant afford it you are second class the cast was great as usual but the first rides we got on broke down one for over a half hour several were closed and over all we were effected by rides broken down over the day while we were on them i still had a decent time but i think walt would be sad to see that people with less money do not get the same experience as people who can afford to pay more long story short disney is now mostly magic if you have deep pockets if not you wont get the same experience as someone that does that makes me kind of sad last but not least the food was mostly terrible i spent dollars on lunch and it sucked even the french fries sucked i still loved taking the grandkids but much of the magic is gone ,2,2022-03-20
31,Disney,it is no longer the happiest place on earth the new set up with everything being done on your phone gives you no time to relax and enjoy anything disney has gone to much on the control of there guests they say you can plan your day but don t believe it ,3,2022-03-16
32,Disneyland = Theft,quick story time i never write poor reviews as i am a business owner and understand how it can impact them but this needs to be public info on how this large cooperation treats their customers we purchased day park hoppers and planned to use from march first two days were fine until disneyland closed the park on the th obviously full stop to our vacation but still on the hook for flights hotels etc fast forward until now we had family members on that trip disney has extended the tickets for a dec expiry so i was planning on going back down problem is that only of the original guests can join i tried using the app and calling customer service to allocate the unused days from my other two family members that can t go and we have already paid for to the ones that can no we can t accommodate that request can we refund the unused days left on the tickets no you have to come back with all people to get any value can you do anything for me i can refund the max pass portion of the tickets so you can pay more at the park for the worse genie plus in summary it was disneys decision to close the parks and their answer for the people they stranded during that time fly and room everyone back down at your expense and we will not make any accommodations from our policy avoid at all costs ,1,2022-03-16
33,Most miserable place on earth,we visited on a wednesday in february crowd was large though we were able to get on most rides in min or less there is wide variety of attractions with star wars area being most recent addition and rise of the resistance being a must do a ride like no other it was nice being able to tour the castle the bobsled coaster is a bit rough pirates of the caribbean is a classic haunted mansion a must do indiana jones fantastic this was our first visit and i look forward to returning again ,1,2022-03-16
34,A Great Park,despite being smaller than any of the four parks at the walt disney world resort in florida there is more to do here in fact a first time visitor might be overwhelmed in addition to a load of dark rides in fantasyland not found in orlando s magic kingdom there s also indiana jones and the legendary matterhorn not to mention entire additional sections like galaxy s edge and mickey s toontown it can also be argued disneyland has superior versions of space mountain and pirates of the caribbean unlike its florida counterparts disneyland also has a genie system that works i was able to book and use every single one available to me throughout my day and even an individual lightning lane for rise of the resistance try doing that if not staying in a resort at wdw even then i had a difficult time doing everything because of the sheer volume of attractions if you ve never visited before you ll likely need two days and two days would be nice even for repeat visitors it s iconic for good reason ,5,2022-03-12
35,"Iconic, for good reason",first off let me say i love disneyland it s my favorite place to visit i was just there with my daughter and we purchased the genie plus which allows you to get on rides faster similar to fast pass it worked wonderfully but disneyland has now decided to charge you extra if you want to get on the rides cars per person webslingers and rise of the resistance per person faster it s not enough that you purchase the genie plus just for that purpose this is so wrong they make so much money already and then to just gauge you more by making you pay more to ride a ride come on disneyland i hope this is not a new trend most of the employees were very nice but not how it used to be you used to be greeted with a smile by everyone and made to feel that it was the happiest place on earth the rides continuously were down throughout our stay after being closed for a year i would think that would be plenty of time to make sure everything was in tip top shape so that the rides would not be breaking down one night while we were there of the most popular rides broke down maybe disney needs to start thinking about the people supporting them and not so much about the almighty dollar everything is beyond expensive and the extra payment to ride some of the rides is ridiculous ,5,2022-03-10
36,Love Disney but......,in the past i would have rated disneyland with five stars after going there during christmas the park has really changed it s all about money and not fun they went to a tier system which made our grandkids ticket go from to for one day we found that many employees where very rude it is not the happiest place on earth anymore it s all about the all mighty dollar i think walt would not be too happy ,4,2022-03-07
37,"While there is no comparison to Disney World. It was nice. Small, lots of people, lots of same rides. A one time visit.",where do i begin the crowds were so bad we were only able to get on three rides in six hours we left the park around pm and went back to our hotel room in hopes of returning later that evening when the crowds would i assume calm down while walking back to the park on harbor blvd about mile from the disneyland entrance around pm my wife and i were jumped and assaulted by a homeless person who pushed me to the ground so hard i required medical attention he ran away before anyone could come help me my wife and i said enough is enough and grabbed an earlier flight home the next day just to get out of there people don t realize how dangerous it is outside the park in crazy california so always walk with a large group if you can as for us we are never returning to the happiest place on earth the place just isn t the same anymore it started with a mouse and is ending with a rat ,4,2022-03-05
38,A nightmare experience,the parks are super crowded even during off peak days and weeks the genie system has broken several of the standby queues of other attractions because of the volume of lightning lane passes they distribute we stood in a deceptively short line for soarin for well over an hour because there was an equally long line on the ll side about maybe six standby people made it through with each group sent down to to board the soarin attraction each cycle the rest was entirely ll riders for over an hour and i can t imagine it was any different before and after we got there everything about the park has completely dropped any pretense of being anything beyond a cynical cash grab ticket prices continue to soar and anything they can think of to tack an extra fee onto they re going to as of today the price for one adult single day pass is at least tack on another if you want to park hop which you can t do until after pm anyways you could shoot for two single park days but then you re looking at about instead of about per adult there s always the socal tickets if you re local but then you re restricted to weekdays once you ve emptied your wallet there you re looking at an additional parking fee per day what is it now if you want to use the lightning lane fastpass service that s another a day per head want that lightning lane on one of the more popular rides that s a separate charge that fluctuates but i ve seen hit as high as and that s not part of the genie fee you paid and is also per person and you d think with all this extra income the parks would be at least as clean and well maintained as they used to be but just like thinking buying these tickets was a good idea you d be wrong they re surprisingly behind on cosmetic upkeep given how much time the parks were closed to the public recently chipped paint lights out storefronts closed off for remodeling tarzan s treehouse covered in scaffolding toontoon closing down for remodeling cleanliness is on the decline portion sizes are decreasing but hey at least you get to view the magic right it s only taken them half a year to decide to bring back parades and the like ,1,2022-03-04
39,An exorbitantly expensive an anticlimactic experience.,right now march all they are offering is three day tickets even aaa only sells the three day tickets the cheapest ticket is per person so bringing your family of four will set you back and who wants day tickets anyway nobody disneyland used to cost when i was a kid they are just about money and the goal is no longer to make people happy but to fleece them out of a small fortune for family of four walt is spinning in his grave ,1,2022-03-04
40,Can't go as tickets are insanely expensive,for the happiest place on earth their customer service seems not to have gotten the memo my wife and i accidentally purchased duplicate tickets for the same visit same dates same people next month and disney is refusing to provide on one of the duplicate tickets hours spent on hold eventually got hung up on by a supervisor needed to dispute with the credit card company come on disney you can do better ,1,2022-03-03
41,Bad experience,still excellent and new additions like star wars galaxy s edge keep it refreshed and up to date have been many times and it continues to be a new experience even as the kids get older ,2,2022-03-02
42,Finally back!!!!!,i just want to say that i fell in love with disneyland it s magical steeped in history and has a really authentic feel that being said man does it get crowded and boy is it expensive it loses a star because while we had plenty of great cast interactions shout out to shannon in chamber of commerce at dca of the time we were greeted by cast members who looked like they d lost the will to live don t get me wrong wdw and dlp have them too but not in the abundance that we found them here i m afraid which is a shame we knew we were off to a bad start when we arrived and went to get a birthday button and she didn t even say happy birthday just pointed to a stand with buttons it wasn t until the end of my second day that a lovely guy called joe in a gift shop in critter counter dca was serving me that he offered to write my name on it for me i get being busy and all but disney is meant to be setting the world standard of customer experience and on this trip it was not ,5,2022-02-26
43,The SADDEST happiest place in the world,unbelievable terrible customer service i have park hopper tickets and only one day tickets are available to reserve the day they said i would have to buy a single ticket for people and eat it on the park hopper ticket because that reservation is not available what lose almost plus rebuy the tickets as single park tickets this will be a one and done experience does t even come close to comparing to the customer service at disney world totally disgusted ,1,2022-02-24
44,TERRIBLE customer service!!,we opted to get genie plus which allowed us to go on every attraction at least once i am not sure that would have been possible without the genie plus we went in january because it was said crowds would be low however the park was packed every day there were no shows but characters were seen regularly throughout the park most disappointing was there was no place to eat there are only a couple sit down restaurants and they were booked up months ago the kiosks only sell junk food so we essentially went hungry at disneyland the cast members were clearly stressed some were outright rude although there were a few cast members who were pleasant to talk with ,1,2022-02-21
45,Disneyland is even fun in the rain and hail over a workday,disneyland is so much fun we had a great family vacation at disney it made me miss walt disney world so now we are planning a trip to florida love love the disney parks ,3,2022-02-16
46,Horrifying treatment by cast member,first trip to disneyland great time husband adult daughter me we are park people we rope drop close down the park we had great experiences rides food we bought the genie it was well worth it but needed our techy daughter to navigate after a few days several hrs on hold my oxygen scooter disabled husband finally got to speak with a rep for the das pass rep was great pleasantly surprised he was able to take o concentrator on rides no roller coasters or drop towers not sure about soarin so skipped it improvements needed for charging stations for medical equipment shouldn t have to idly sit in st aid i found plug on main st so husband would have enough o to get back to disneyhotel more photo opportunities ride photos of unmasked should be covered so we could have our ride photo also very long walk need transportation staying on property but no extra hrs perks need transportation ride operators fantastic with das got to do all we wanted and had great time ,1,2022-02-15
47,"very crowded, but still fun",hadn t been there for years nice to see changes and also nice to see the same friendly and clean park that everyone has been remarking has gone downhill i didn t notice that at all maybe it s all in the way you treat the cast members first i prefer the way they do the characters now sure there are no hugs but you can still get a good socially distanced interaction and i hope they keep it that way i also like the reservations for the park itself i hope that doesn t go away if there s any complaint it s what did they do to the turkey legs i know it was always a love hate relationship between people i used to love them the one i got was so sinewy and full of other bones even with a knife it was impossible to get the meat off so that ll do it for turkey legs for me i don t usually eat at the parks ate at hungry bears this time and enjoyed the food the merchandise in the stores is very scant i m not a souvenior shopper but the friend i was with is and the shelves and racks were wont for more stuff ,4,2022-02-09
48,So Much Fun,no need to pay extra to sit in the blue bayou you can always eat at cafe orleans and get the same food my family loves the monte cristos though they have gotten smaller as of late which is good since too much went to waste i got the shrimp and grits which were fabulous fun times ,5,2022-02-08
49,Disneyland first time - family - disabled - great time but room for improvement!,overpriced shawdow of disneys dreams parks very crowded cast members are not helpfull just a headache every time you need something if you already payed a vacation try to posterize it all the people are insatisfied and tired at disneyland ,5,2022-02-07
50,Great day at Disney!,this was my th trip to disneyland we had lots of fun rides and atmosphere was good the only complaint i had was the pre ordering of food on the app it was a pain to order food in advance and then hang out at a location waiting for it other than that it was good ,4,2022-01-30
51,"Still Good, Not Quite “Magical”",first time at disneyland even though the park is smaller than disneyworld we walked miles in one day hate the fact they charge for lightning lane now but it definitely does save you time my son and i rode pretty much on every ride and yes even the canoes we were there from opening to close unfortunately the winds were high so no fireworks ,4,2022-01-28
52,Disney - what do you expect?!?!,once great is a shadow of former self and is just milking it many of rides are broken or shut down new rides are barely interesting and frequently in operable even when the best parts of rides are not functioning for example this weekend trip indiana jones was mostly inoperable no big snake cement ball or vocal tracks yet stayed open so they could lure people into the park small world played jngle bells for almost of ride wasn t localized in other languages its jan th for crying out loud is disney that lazy that that cant remove a few decorations and convert ride back to its theme autopia the cars are so de tuned they are almost inoperable and slower than walking way too boring the food is uninspring ticket prices are advertized at day yet they charge day only avail if buy day pass further whil they have disbanded the fast pass you can now get to front of line if you pay an extra ticket for a genie pass but that desnt work for new star wars ride you have to pay we are unlikely to be back for a very long time and while many will go here i doubt walt would find all the ride down time and money grabbing moves they are taking acceptable ,4,2022-01-25
53,"Overrated, Overpriced and a Shadow of Former Self",we love disney this trip was the first for my little granddaughter and everything was near perfect there were a couple of things that i wanted to share first no one checked for vax cards at all and we were there for a week this surprised me secondly its a small world was still in christmas mode which was also surprising other than that we had a great time between the parks and wildlife definitely be back there s no bad disneyland trip and almost everyone was super friendly and helpful ,2,2022-01-24
54,Disneyland / California Adventure ROCKS!,we haven t been to disneyland since taking our grandson in but wanted to celebrate our anniversary there in december like many others here we were shocked at the walk to and from the entrance we estimated it was almost a mile each way we knew we d be walking a lot but didn t count on this as well the walk back at pm is a killer after the day s walk in the park being about miles we were able to get on all the rides we wanted to with very short waits eating lunch was crazy as everything is through the ap with maybe one very long line open for on the spot ordering for dinner we lucked out at the plaza inn no wait and friendly service and very yummy food we also enjoyed the parade and fireworks with snow falling afterwards all in all it was a fun day ,5,2022-01-22
55,Fun for all...Wear your walking shoes!,thinking that the reservation system would be a method of crowd control along with it being after the holiday rush we anticipated and planned out our day no amount of planning could have changed the horrific outcome it was mobbed and many rides were closed due to breakdowns or decoration removal it s clear that a patron s health is the furthest thing from their minds mask mandate not enforced and covid vaccination card not required nothing good to report about the day so after walking steps yep folks about miles that day we decided to do the matterhorn bobsled line was long but after getting into my sled realized that the floor was covered in vomit they were not keeping up with park sanitation anyways that day but this took the cake no amount of trying to notify staff of this gross situation was recognized as they robotically asked to see you pull on the yellow seat belt tag at the end of the ride as i tried to report this to the disembarking staff they just repeated please exit to the right over over ignored me pity the next riders that ended our day we will never be back mr walt disney was not looking down on the park with pride so very disappointed in the whole experience the magic is gone cry ,4,2022-01-17
56,Dismal Day,visited disneyland ca jan with family who had jumped through all the covid travel hurdles in order to join us for what we had hoped would be a joyous mini family reunion after not seeing each other for two years not the happiest place on earth rather it was one of our most miserable days it began with the complicated reservation system which also requires you to buy a ticket so you must have barcodes thinking that this would be a method of crowd control along with it being after the holiday rush we anticipated and planned out our day using the basically useless disney app we were even more excited to see it rated for crowd size for the day no amount of planning could have changed the horrific outcome it was mobbed beyond anything i have ever witnessed and many rides were closed due to breakdowns or decoration removal many of them not disclosed at the gate entrance no jungle cruise pirates haunted mansion little mermaid splash mountain etc the result of this was huge lines of very upset people for all the open rides a lot of crisscrossing the park to find a line shorter than an hour however if the sign said min wait from here you can bet that meant at least min line time lies abounded there were no live shows no fireworks and very few characters around the park don t even get me going on the reservations required if you want to eat or alternatively you can just stand in very long lines elsewhere shout out to earl of sandwiches in downtown disney that provides decent food fare at reasonable prices have open air seating escape from the crowds disneyland does no covid vaccination card checks they re missing an opportunity to incentivize folks in my humble opinion mask wearing is not enforced so if you want covid or any of its variants you have a real good chance of catching it here as lines are long dense and faces are from yours at any given moment despite your best efforts it s clear that a patron s health is the farthest thing from their minds so after walking steps yep folks about miles that day we decided to do the matterhorn bobsleds before watching some projection show at p m line was long but after getting into my sled realized that the floor was covered in vomit they were not keeping up with park sanitation anyways that day but this took the cake no amount of trying to notify staff of this gross situation was recognized as they robotically asked to see you pull on the yellow seat belt tag at the end of the ride as i tried to report this to the disembarking staff they just repeated please exit to the right over over ignored me pity the next riders that ended our day we will never be back mr walt disney was not looking down on the park with pride he never would have wanted it to turn into this huge money grab where the only apparent goal was to cram the park as full as possible squeeze every bit of cash possible from each visitor souvenirs were ridiculously overpriced but note you can many at walgreens across harbor blvd for a third the price so very disappointed in the whole experience the magic is gone cry ,1,2022-01-14
57,Dismal Day,i agree with the previous posts you won t have a great time unless you do your research and plan in advance gone are the days of showing up and buying tickets at the booth the gates open hour before opening you go in absorb main street and purchase the genie for each person on your already downloaded app and linked tickets do this for everyone in your party that has a cell phone prior to arriving at the park you want to park in the toy story parking lot the buses were running and if they re not because of covid you can walk the shortest way you must order food via the app because the lines at food are ridiculous order your food get an assigned time and cruise around and make your way there there are still carts with the usual snacks and drinks if you are covid crazy and scared this is not the place for you everyone wears a mask but not all the way on or all of the time there s no social distancing buy the genie for the lightening lanes you won t regret the extra per person if you don t expect long waits we went on a tuesday in january and with the genie we waited minutes at most without it s over an hour if you go early always go right and head straight to space mountain the rest of them will go left straight to the star wars galaxy to go to star wars rise of the resistance there are no solid food options in the galaxy which was disappointing yes there s olga s cantina but you have to wait very long there s ronto s but they only have two food options best to stick with the classics i recommend honey bear as the best value ,1,2022-01-14
58,Great time!,we went to disneyland in october before the genie plus it was so nice the stand by lines were short and it was even fall break we went on toy story times in a row only waiting minutes each time since lightning lanes were added it s not the same experience even if you buy a genie plus you can only go on your favorite ride time with it before you have to wait in huge lines the rest of the time they let in family from stand bye line to or more families in lightening lane we won t be going getting a season pass anymore disneyland has lost its magic ,5,2022-01-13
59,Magical,hadn t been back to disney since precovid i am so disappointed with disney we went back the weekend of new year s we got a genie pass for and extra per ticket and you can only use it once per ride on top of that they want more money for some of the popular rides to go on the lightning lane up to more per ride per ticket more disney shame on you for becoming so greedy also now you have predict when you ll be hungry in order to be able to order your food you cannot just order food when you feel like it food quality is not as good anymore either the park wasn t too busy like it usually is but lines were still as big as when it s a packed park don t think i will be going back used to go times a year but this is ridiculous shame on you disney ,5,2022-01-10
60,Disneyland is way too crowded and could learn from Universal Hollywood’s safety precautions,this was my th visit in last years this is my kids favourite destination for christmas but the changes we see this year was disastrous reservation system you only get reservation if you opt for more hooper pass other it doesn t show availability i spent about canadian for days entry for family of now it s usd per person per day for lightening pass other you are standing in line for hours and still no end to lines i pay extra per day in days now for new rides like spider man and radiator springs and star wars it s usd extra per ride as they are not included in lightening pass xx usd more customer service there is not even than it used to be years ago it s feels like disneyland is not run by friendly mickey anymore but taken over by greedy pete it was my last trip to disneyland california still hope other disney parks are still same ,3,2022-01-09
61,Disney got too Greedy and not good experience,there is nothing more magic than disneyland on christmas unfortunately it was raining hard but we came prepared with ponchos boots and umbrellas and did not mind too much the rain but some of the rides closed as soon as the rain started and throughout the day more rides broke down because we had lightning lane we did the rides we wanted without too much wait the star wars camp us awesome be sure to do this when you arrive because it gets busy very quickly up to mn of wait the rise of the resistance ride is a truly immersive one definitely the best of disneyland you go through many stages where you can see stormtroopers and general akbar before riding pods and escaping kylo ren amazing the problem with disney is the very small number of bathrooms available for example there are only in the new orleans square too little you end up waiting in line be sure to bring a charger for your phone in order to navigate virtual lines and check wait time you need your phone and between checking disney app and taking pictures you can deplete the battery ,1,2022-01-07
62,Just not worth it,i had not been back in years and things have changed quite a bit and many other things were the same with kids and we knew this was the time to go i have to say that the park was far less full than my last trip so long ago without capacity restrictions however if you are not comfortable with crowds and not vaccinated please don t go right now as others have said the staff is doing its best to keep people masked up in indoor lines but there were still people you were pretty close to in outdoor lines without masks on my recommendation is definitely to be there when the park opens if at all possible you get so much reward for running to those first few rides with short lines and it hooked my kids and kept them going when the lines started getting longer i was not up for paying for lightning lanes via genie but after going i would have to consider what money you spend in place of just standing in line the one big ride to do as early or late as possible is rise of the resistance worth the time minute line for us but we saw most of the rest of the time i have to say the app use for ordering food remotely was a big and pleasant surprise nothing like removing one form of lining up for free don t forget the main street shops are open minutes before and minutes after the park closes so you can do your wandering then ,2,2022-01-07
63,Magic is over and it change into pure business now,my third time visiting since childhood in and i have always been impressed with how well this park is managed we visited ca adventure on christmas eve and magic kingdom on christmas and took advantage of the genie to bypass the longer lines on the high demand rides and it worked like magic ,1,2022-01-04
64,"We’ve had enough. Buyer, BEWARE!",buy lightening pass or don t go yes it s an extra daily expense yes disney is way too greedy but if you don t get the pass is really the old fast pass you will come out of disneyland disappointed at the few rides you got into ridiculous how greedy disneyland is now but with the lightening pass you will be able to ride most of the rides without the pass you will be in line hrs for each ride ,1,2022-01-02
65,Happiest Place on Earth,i always love the gardens so perfectly manicured landscaped and beautiful in terms of amusement parks no one outperforms disney i still love this park having visited several times over the years ,5,2021-12-29
66,Genie+ was worth it for us,please please please avoid disneyland during this pandemic if you can it s so crowded i can t believe we still have to pay extra for popular rides lightning lane was unbelievable long even with the extra purchase everywhere was so crowded i think disneyland should reduce the capacity and let people enjoy the place with a peace of mind ,4,2021-12-29
67,Disneyland has lost its magic,it s all about nickel and diming you now with disney had listed minute wait for cars it took hours minutes in line individuals would walk up and get to ride immediately now forcing you to buy ticket then genie then additional money for the high end rides beyond ridiculous last time i m doing disneyland giving disney world one more chance this summer however staying off property for the first time ever after years going annually i was amazed at what you can get off property i m renting a house that sleeps eleven for less than what you would pay for a value in room ,1,2021-12-28
68,Nickel and Diming Disney Fans,sooo disappointed disney has lost its magic and now it is all about how much money they can squeeze out of people really miss the fastpass system now you have to spend extra money to get in into a lightning lane on top of high ticket price and everything in the park being way overpriced stood in line for almost hours for the rise of the resistance ride and then were notified that it broke down there was no offer to come back without a wait and we tried later stood in line for another hour and the ride broke down again so overall instead of feeling like we were in the happiest place on earth we left the park very upset and disappointed ,1,2021-12-27
69,No more Disney magic,if you are a big star wars fan i would recommend spending the whole day in this area and stay in line for this ride remember to use the restroom before hand the lines are long ,1,2021-12-26
70,Rise of the Resistance,we went on christmas eve and christmas day of it should be criminal for them to allow so many people in the park on a given day we waited hours per ride it was miserable greed ,5,2021-12-26
71,Miserable Wait Times,we visited disneyland dca days with genie plus and also purchased two individual ll for dca disneyland during holiday seasons is certainly very pretty but tons of people took away our enjoyment lines were always long everywhere disney genie plus time slots were far apart we got to ride the rides we care about multiple times so we re good ,1,2021-12-25
72,Very crowded park,our family purchased the military salute tickets prior to pandemic which were given an expiration date of we continually attempted to make reservations the last few weeks so we could upgrade our tickets to passes our family loves disneyland after being unable to secure reservations my husband contacted disney through the chat feature on the app several days prior to the expiration date on the last d y we called several times and waited lengthy hold times the last time we waited for minutes and spoke with dominique to upgrade it was p their closing time so she said she was transferring us to a manager we waited for minutes for someone to answer and then disconnect after stating she couldn t hear us we sent another chat an email attempted to call and someone finally contacted us today she gave us policy and stopped chat when we asked for her superior as this goes beyond policy after doing everything within policy she advised we cant upgrade tickets if we tried after the date i d understand but we honored the policies set and thought disneyland would do the same we took screenshots of everything to show supposed to be christmas gifts dissappointing ,3,2021-12-25
73,Don’t waste your hard earned money.,disneyland is absolutely the worst value for your money i don t have a problem spending good money on a worthwhile leisure experience but this is absolutely the worst experience i ve ever encountered for the prepaid purchase price of i could not believe how much disneyland has separated itself from the happiest place on to becoming the biggest social ripoff on the planet after having spent this kind of money times seven disneyland could not even find a way for us to spend a lunchtime or dinner time meal together accessing their app or going door to door at their restaurants led to nothing but rejection and disappointment with no one in their employ willing to find a positive solution having grown up with disneyland in my backyard i ve many opportunities in my lifetime to enjoy their park first as a child then as a teenager next as a father and now as a grandfather all i can say is that disneyland is now a total disappointment and has lost sight of the reason for their success i will never visit their park again disneyland i hope you read this ,1,2021-12-18
74,New Genie + Pass and Lightning Lane get two big thumbs down,new genie and ligtning line are a racket we spent extra per person one day and the next ,1,2021-12-16
75,Happiest Place on Earth,i haven t been to disneyland for years we went to celebrate our first date here and now we are celebrating year anniversary we saw so many strollers with small children and those scooters i would recommend people not take their kids until they are years old so they can take it all in i see them in lines looking at other peoples butts the rides can be in the dark scary and can jostle you around ex the matahorn for an adult or older child disneyland is the happiest place on earth the staff are so polite it is contagious buy the lightning pass so you don t have to wait in line so much take time to just look around you might find a hidden mickey there is a lot of junk food here but during holidays we had this amazing plant based mexican type sopa and ate dinner in a mexican place to get something healthy bring water bottle fruit nuts and a sandwich for kids so you can keep going stop for parade see fireworks walking back to your hotel make sure to check schedule for the pop up entertainment we saw bell ringers singers and dime singers drummers dancers their costumes and makeup are fabulous disneyland could do another part for small children of just things to look at and touch with minnie and mickey walking around disney came close with the the yosemite looking park with ropes bridge it was great and santa was there ,5,2021-12-10
76,Disneyland CA,we spent days at disneyland with family buy your tickets on line ahead of time since the number of tickets sold is limited get there early so that you can get through security and the ticket line prior to the gates opening we had a wonderful time ,5,2021-12-07
77,Had ad experience with customer service to resolve issue with a park reservation that I lost half of my ticket value.,wow we have been to disneyland almost every year for years and this was by far our worst experience i don t know if disney doesn t have enough staff or what is happening really weird stuff happened like groups of people cutting lines crowd overload with limited cast members guiding foot traffic after fireworks parades and rides shutting down with no communication we d stand in line for long periods of time and then people not cast members would tell us the ride closed down and we d have to turn around if you think you will get on rides quickly because you have a reservation we couldn t differentiate between times we ve been with or without reservations as far as crowds go please bring back fast pass disney ,1,2021-12-06
78,Missing the Magic!,the new booking system is bad we had a party of and wanted to add two more but the dates a few days later was sold out the park limits people so would would think the lines would not be crazy long we had one person who had a ticket but could not make a reservation even though everyone else could buy new tickets disney the staff is over worked they have smiles on there faces and tears in there eyes not sure i ever want to come back not the disney i knew as a kid ,1,2021-11-25
79,Pooh sized fun,it had been years since i had visited disneyland in that time i had gained a lot of weight especially in the hip area i know i know tmi or is it i was worried attending dl with my much smaller friends what rides could i ride comfortably or even fit other theme parks are not so accommodating i wanted to review so that maybe i can help other pooh sized people and put their minds at ease i was very much relieved to find i could easily ride almost every ride including favorites like indiana jones matterhorn and even the new star wars rides star tours was very snug but doable space mountain was probably the only exception and not very accommodating to those with extra curves or wide hips can not attest to the nemo ride autotopia or big thunder mountain as these were closed as for california adventure the only ride that seemed unwelcoming to pooh sized was goofys flight school did not try the jumping jellyfish ride or guardians of the galaxy i hope this helps put some minds at ease have fun ,4,2021-11-21
80,"Longtime Disneyland fan is pretty much over it. Overpriced, under delivers",first time back is years and like my last visit and the visits before overcrowded just miserable to walk around bring a water bottle and use refill stations skip any salads fruit options at restaurants consistently awful almost rancid tried times at outlets staff seems so much less professional and more unhappy than ever before in a hour day we were only able to ride attractions due to crowds and broken rides ,3,2021-11-18
81,"The Park will be fabulous and the memories will be great, but at a grand a day, I expect a little Customer Service...",well i ll start off by letting all know that i have yet to arrive so this is more of a customer service review today i was trying to reserve my starting park for my parkhopper passes for thanksgiving week i received a call letting me know to make my selections as days for next week are already selling out ok so there is some urgency here i go onto my disney app and can not find the passes anywhere i go online and the same i find the package in my hotel reservation but other than listing that i have indeed purchased park hopper passes none are to be found i start a chat under the chat with us link automated response and question as to whether i m on property or not maybe select yes i respond with no and the next automated message asks me what i need assistance with i relay the issue and after plus minutes i end the chat because no response i call disney the message relays that they are experiencing unusually high volume unusual for winter or thanksgiving or during covid and the message asks me to use the chat on the app and then promptly provides no other option no buttons work at this point the only option is to hang up and end the call so back to the chat with the same result only i don t end the chat while waiting for a chat response i decide that maybe i am close enough to next week to go ahead and confirm my hotel stay so i enter all of the required information and my stay is confirmed and my hopper passes are now available to me to reserve my dates and due to the fact that i m staying at a disney hotel none of the days are sold out though if indeed you are not they are happy ending with a lot of unnecessary trial and error on my part but here s the topper hours after my first chat and hours after my second chat i got a response to my chat i mentioned that they need to get their yes actually the dollar sign together informed rebekah that i understood that this was not a her issue and asked her not to take offense relayed my experience and the fact that after spending very close to k per day between hotel and park tickets for my son and myself that the customer service overall was lacking the chat again titled chat with us on the app being the only option that disney had as the phones did not allow for human to human or even ai interaction was lacking she kindly informed me that this is not a chat this is a message service and kindly disconnected the session ,1,2021-11-17
82,Awesome but lacking Covid protocols.,unbelievable i m sure walt disney is rolling in his grave i will never subject my family to such a money grabbing rip off experience i don t mind paying but never ever will i attend another disney park customer service there is no such thing at disney california poor service and and very unwilling to assist at any point multiple broken rides with no responsibility even after waiting in line for minutes do forget the disneyland app it horrible the app took the place of real customer service and very few disney employees know how to navigate through the app when it works you would sooner find a dinosaur then have the same positive experience at california disney that you had during your childhood shame on disney this isn t walt disney s vision period ,4,2021-11-17
83,Terrible,and because it is walt s original vision i was pleased overall and main street is more charming than at wdw but there is a lack of helpful cast members except for the security area and they are the most friendly helpful people ever even though they have a stressful job it is difficult to find the entries to many rides as they are not well marked guests were asking other guests how they got in line when we went there was no max pass and no genie so most lines were horrendous when genie comes out get it which i think was disney s plan to let people see what a pain it is with one or the other ,1,2021-11-17
84,This is Walt's Land,new orleans square restaurant no longer offer pomme frites as starter you have to order a meal rust on fences broken tiles in bathrooms no papertowels customer service horrible no body smiling happy horrible the new ceo horrible job cutting too many corners,4,2021-11-17

86,"Not like old Disney, too bad",had i not traveled with people whose iphones could scan the menus i would have starved to death i feel sorry for seniors or others who cannot afford or don t know how to use a cell phone hope you like popcorn for what disney charges to enter this park this app sitch should be way better but we did get into the blue bayou and the actual humans who work there should be paid more and beyond commended for their customer service we had great service a great meal and a special time because of the humans vr kq,2,2021-11-13
87,World Class,bucket list great day busy or not ride the fire truck and relive some history or let harold scare the pants off you on the matterhorn and the haunted mansion alone is always worth admission no question top american destination compares only with yellowstone new orleans and name your other two ,5,2021-11-11
88,LOVED IT,my son and i loved it we have been to disneyworld several times this was the first time at disneyland we went on a wednesday nov the lines were not long at all i believe the most we waited for a ride was min it was our first time here so we didnt realized we had to queue for several rides we were able to do the star trek one but missed the others the ride was phenomenal and the process of reserving simple we had a blast and were able to do both parks in one day please note you do have to walk a bit to get from the parking lot to the entrance not an issue for me because i exercise regularly but my son was tired ,5,2021-11-10
89,May the fourth be with you,rise of the resistance puts you into a star wars movie smugglers run rocks clean safe fun just the best ,5,2021-11-03
90,Disney is a downer,first off lower the price the tickets are too overpriced the service was pretty bad as well we had a terrible time and would for sure stick with knott s berry farm ,1,2021-11-01
91,Too Crazy….Not as Much Fun as Prior Years…Miss the fast pass,i ve been to disneyland several times this was the first time that we went for consecutive days we made reservations for disneyland for two days and california adventure for one day even with reservations the crowds were large and the waits were long i did my research so we knew ahead of time the tricks for how to successfully get a boarding pass for rise of the resistance and webslingers we also knew about getting to rope drop each morning and had a strategy for which rides to go on if not for countless hours reading blogs we would not have been able to make the system work for us like we did our waits for everything would have been longer we rode rotr twice and webslingers once although even with the queue the wait for webslingers is extremely long we were able to do most everything we wanted due to being there for days and extensive planning if we were to have just shown up not knowing any of this it probably would have been a horrible one star experience i hear that they are going to bring a fastpass option back but that it will cost an extra bucks per person for a family of that s pretty steep so i guess my advice is do your research have a plan and go for longer than one day to enjoy all of the magic that is still disney ,3,2021-10-30
92,The tickets were too overpriced. The service was terrible and one person even told me to F OFF.,disneyland is a classic and an amazing place the new star wars area is great very similar to disney world in florida it s always fun to see the original disney park the only reason i gave it a out of is there are currently no fast passes and lines were very long i d highly recommend rope dropping get there before the park opens if you want to ride one of the high demand rides ,1,2021-10-28
93,"Had a great time, but only due to significant planning",we were a party of one of the attendants was unable to go at the last moment a week before of the reservations because of a hospital situation with a cancer the just repeat as a parrot we don t do refunds or credit they dont hear that we are people with unusual situations that need to be reviewed individually they neither hear we were other people attending and consuming on the stores and restaurants they just keep repeating no refunds no credit can be used by another person in the future yeah very easy to do another trip living otuside the united states sure just make another trip and spend a lot of money again worst customer service ever funny thing universal make the refund in just minutes not my happiest place and definitely not happy customer,4,2021-10-28
94,Awesome park - currently no fast passes (long lines),i have been to the florida park so i in a way wanted to see how this held up to that one this one is smaller in every way even the princess castle in the center of the park is smaller with that when the park gets full they have little area to spread out at the start of the day space mountain was down the biggest ride in the park the frontier area was closed for refurbishment meaning the second biggest ride was also down we did eventually get to ride space mountain so that was good we also enjoyed the bobsled ride that is unique to this park i got to ride the millennium falcon ride which was cool but getting into the ride was the best part they are limiting access to the star wars rise of the resistance and so most people won t get to experience it the food options felt so limited inside the park if you want something to eat you have to go out of the park and head down disney mainstreet overall this is the lesser of the disney park it has a few of the classics but misses the thrill of the main park in florida ,4,2021-10-27
95,Disneyland is easy to negotiate with a few helpful hints,i am years old and had not been to disneyland specifically the haunted mansion which i saw every sunday on t v opening the disney show i had a great time at disneyland and here are my tips in case you don t know you need both a reservation and a ticket to get in on your chosen day both the disney app is critical to have and works very well arriving before disneyland opens is a great idea less crowded in the am way less make your dinner or lunch sit down reservations way in advance in fact do it as soon as you know you are going you can always cancel them mobil ordering in the park is easy and works well even if you miss your pick up window go to your food place and give your order number anyway they will probably help you the tiki bar bathrooms are very new and nice and many but restrooms in other parts of the park are always clean star wars virtual cue is well explained in the app get ready a few minutes before the time to make your star wars reservations and then keep hitting the refresh button exactly at the appointed time right now that is am and pm very simple also there is place in the app so you can see wait times at different rides critical it is accessed by the menu bar at the bottom of the app bring a backpack to hold a few snacks water extra clothes and other personal management items rain ponchos are critical for the water rides buy them at any drugstore or amazon mouse ears are at walgreens but in the disney stores up to you currently fireworks only on f sat sun we watched them from a convenient parking garage all disney workers were really nice and helpful ask them all your questions dole whip is really good but perhaps overhyped by dole money no doubt lots of vendors for coke water snacks if you are buying a ton of goodies i have heard you can send them to the front of the park to pick up on the way out but we just used our backpack we attended on a monday that started off rainy cloudy so crowds were low in the morning and we loved it by pm the sun and the peeps strollers were out in force for us hours was enough i think it s super important to know how you will get to d if you are walking from your hotel there are a couple entrances look at your phone map and maybe walk there a day ahead if you can we went to downtown disney no ticket necessary open to the public and liquor is sold the day before and found our best route was way shorter than the one we took disneyland sells no alcohol in the park just so you know and i am so glad because the family atmosphere is really wonderful try the mickey mouse beignets better than nola fresh hot not too sweet specifically about the haunted mansion amazing decor but the ride goes through so fast that you don t have adequate time to see and enjoy everything also it s the effects could be so much better and so much more i think they need to build another mansion that is fresh and exciting and spooky in the same way that star wars rise of the resistance is super awesome i would go through or times in a row if the waiting time was low ,5,2021-10-23
96,It was ok but didn’t meet expectations and growing tired of poor service and safety being blamed on Covid,i m happy when our grandchildren are happy and we have the best bear papa ever because he fed us all between rides while holding our grandbaby thanks babe ps it s impossible to say which is your favorite it wouldn t be fair so we ll say the friday night fireworks psps we over bought souvenirs big smile with tongue sticking out thank you disneyland we love you ,4,2021-10-22
97,Happy wife happy life!,i still have the watch my dad bought me on my st visit to the disneyland park the lovely woman who sold it to us looked just like alice in wonderland my favorite character was peter pan but chose alice instead so i would make her as happy as she made me with her kindness i was only years old i must have visited the parks in florida and california every year throughout my childhood and i have wonderful memories of each trip now i m all grown up and decided to bring my children so they would experience the same joy sadly on my last visit instead of happy memories when we got to the person who would check our tickets what i got was humiliation screams and lies the woman who looked just like stockard channing sitting in the booth just next to the wheelchair rental shop shouted at us and tried to destroy my mom s printed code bar as i tried to explain over and over that it was her st day visiting but it was my kid s and mine was our nd she wouldn t listen they sent me to the ticket booth in the middle between the california adventure and disnelyland entrance as i tried to explain to the kind woman there the tears welled up on top of my face mask so much i had to pull it to the side or i wouldn t have been able to find my way back to another line to have the ticket scanned all throughout our visit i became more and more disappointed the app would constantly show rides off and on service we got trapped in waiting for service to come back only once did it finally reopen the last one indiana jones i got really concerned to be kept inside in such a small space with so many people in the middle of a pandemic without safe distancing and with most gel dispensers out of gel my mom even got hurt getting in and out of rides as quick as she could without extra help from any of the staff sadly she couldn t even enjoy the rest of the park because of the pain in her ankle what happened where did the magic go is it more important now to have as many people as possible pay for these expensive tickets than to service them let alone have a magical experience i ve already tried writing through the app and mail repeatedly but have had no answer i also talked to the people in customer relations at the park hope this time will be different so i can get a full refund but who knows perhaps they re too busy for this too ,5,2021-10-19
98,Beyond horrible. Magic is gone.,i am a dream key holder i regretted it very much because i couldn t even make any reservation shame on disney magic key holders couldnt even select a date but if you buy a regular ticket all dates are open ,1,2021-10-19
99,Is the magic gone?,let me start this by saying i have been going to disneyland for years i have always loved it even when it was at its busiest my friends and i just went october th the park was full and mostly we spent our time standing in lines even to order food long lines all of the charm and fun seems to have disappeared a lot of construction going on stood in line for minutes on jungle cruise then the ride broke down and everyone had to exit no fireworks and no fantasia we tried to get on rise of the resistance and by all the tickets were gone the same thing happened at noon totally ridiculous way to run a disney ride we felt that they were really doing a poor job of running the park the covid excuse is a lie get it together they need new management walt would be turning over in his grave we won t be back and this makes us all very sad ,2,2021-10-18
100,DISNEY SCAM ON MAGIC KEYHOLDERS,october must have a reservation what a joke as it was packed with more people than space i am not kidding you cannot move mobile order food is over an hour wait cast members are not accommodating and is dirty disneyland has no covid protocol i have been going for over year and this place is an embarrassment to the brand no hand sanitizer or cleaning of anything i have been a shareholder and supportive parent i would not even dorn a shirt with their branding goodbye ,1,2021-10-17
101,"Refund, refund, refund!!!! Disney you need to own up and stop raping families for cash!!!",we came to dl to celebrate our th wedding anniversary we did days at dl and needed it to ride everything as the crowds were huge because of annual pass holders beware if you are from out of state like us the aps are allowed to be there mon thursday i think they should have more limited days as it really ruins the experience for tourists like us the disney hotels are ridiculous even for middle class as far as costs so we had to stay at a good neighbor arrive min before official opening and you can get deep inside the park for rope drop we headed to haunted mansion to do the nightmare before christmas version it was amazing we were able to ride everything we wanted but it took days with the huge crowds and no social distancing we enjoyed a meal at the river belle terrace and at the plaza inn as both didn t require reservations but were nicer meals it was impossible to get an advanced dining reservation anywhere in the park and i had been trying for weeks the halloween projection show was one night and fireworks the next and they were both outstanding we saw a lot of characters which was nice and you take selfies with them we were able to get the rise of the resistance pass at a m just make sure you have good wifi or on the internet and close other apps so nothing is open on your phone we love the different versions of the rides that are also at wdw in florida space mountain is better here and smoother i was in line for the matterhorn and it went down right when a earthquake hit not sure if there was a correlation missed that mr lincoln wasn t open nor thunder mt no parades but characters were plentiful i miss the better selection in the shops as now everything is massed produced and we actually bought less as the clothing is not as good as it used to be nothing embroidered all screen art that is cheap mickey ice cream bars were frozen and took forever to dethaw i wish they had shuttles to the good neighbor hotels that are far down the street as it s a long walk after a hour day ,1,2021-10-06
102,Fun at DL but need to limit annual pass holders,awesome day and night at disneyland park awesome halloween spectular light show fireworks st time seeing them at its a small world ride ,4,2021-10-04
103,Disneyland,as an adult it s nice to go without kids so when the kids go to college book a trip and enjoy feeling free ,5,2021-09-28
104,If you don't like Disneyland then stay home,this park may not be as big as disney world but it can hold its own i wanted some ears the emerald green space mountain buzz light year and splash mountain were great stops lines were long the restaurants were all busy till late night the fireworks were amazing best place to stand is in the middle of main street but close to the castle love the halloween stuff was in full force ,5,2021-09-20
105,Mickey Ears Galore!! Different Colors and themes!,despite all the coviod business the park was largely open and inviting and my friend and i had a good time on our day visit ,5,2021-09-18
106,Well Accommodated,got shut down at the star wars rise of the resistance ride terrible service virtual queue shuts down in seconds and says all groups are full spent on tix to see this an there was no warning that availability was so ridiculously limited such a rip off won t be back ,4,2021-09-16
107,No Hope for the Resistance,we were there at the end of july so hopefully this isn t an issue now there was no transportation to and from the park and parking structure nowhere did it say we would have to walk a mile or more especially after factoring in the round about completely illogical security line my daughter and i have knee problems she has had surgery and she has a condition that causes her to pass out if she gets too hot and or walks a lot we had to stop every few feet to let her rest when we finally got to the park there were no wheelchairs available she was weakened from the walk so we thought she would benefit from riding and may avoid passing out there was a ridiculously long waiting list for one we were able to get drinks and let her rest and she did pretty good but would have done much better had we not had the trek to the park to begin with had we known this we would not have gone as for the park itself only a few half decent rides one of which broke down while we were on it and as with any park everything was outrageously priced that is to be expected though lines for everything were long including food star wars millenium falcon ride was the only bright point of the day would not do it again would not recommend ,1,2021-09-16
108,Definitely not worth the 1 mile+ walk to get there. Hope,it s been on my bucket list forever to come to disneyland and it was well worth the nearly year wait we stayed at the homewood suites and just walked in happy days so thankful to be able to experience it with my young family staff were delightful wait times for our visit were pretty short and i massively rate mobile order rise of the resistance is truly amazing so glad we got to experience it so immersive i found several of the rides here to be better than their wdw counter parts space big thunder and pirates especially an unforgettably magical day ,1,2021-09-11
109,Simply wonderful,for all the money disneyland make they can t afford customer service we had day hopper and had people we did not know about the new reservation requirement and had went in on friday some reason we were not able to buy tickets for the other for friday and saturday thinking out day hopper actually would allow us consecutive day we went ahead and bought day ticket for friday to solve the issue then we checked and the over paid park hopper had availability for saturday labor day weekend so we bite the bullet and bought since the other ticket didnt seem to have issue then later we check it turn out the day hopper forced the reservation to monday because there was no avaibility on saturday and sunday so now we have over priced ticket for saturday and day hopper that has a reservation on monday and we are leaving sunday called and waited years on the phone no answer track down different support number called many times and each time you call they always say too busy call back seriously we spent over and can t even talk to someone about the issue disney has gotten way too big with money from movie etc they don t need to care about customer service anymore save your money and go else where ,5,2021-09-07
110,Wow Disneyland after such a long time,wow i had not been here in a very long time the park looks amazing we loved the new star wars ride reservations are needed the food at the bayou caf was excellent but expensive the rides were very well kept and the people were mostly exceptionally friendly ,5,2021-09-02
111,Disney during COVID,if you re scared of the crowds due to covid then this is not the place to go but there are pros and cons to it the con is that even with the reservations this place is still pretty crowded there is no physical distancing especially when you are waiting in line the pro is that they have made is so that the lines move much faster even with the crowds some of the rides that used to be an hour long wait was only minutes on a weekday but the saturday took longer my family was able to do most everything with our day pass and the online food ordering was very helpful a lot of rides require people to wear masks and the cast members were good about telling people to comply if you are driving i recommend parking at the toy story parking lot that is the only lot with shuttles the other lots although covered force you to walk almost a mile to get to the park gates in the morning you pass through the security metal detectors at this lot so you can bypass them at the gates this changes in the afternoon the virtual queue on the app is the only way to get to experience the spiderman web slingers and star wars rise of the resistance rides i highly recommend rise of the resistance if you love star wars this ride is so awesome but spiderman was disappointing we did the virtual line and still had to wait in line for an hour for a ride that only lasted minutes it wasn t worth the wait my family really loved this most recent trip because it was everything we remember plus a bunch of new things we hadn t experienced galaxy s edge avengers campus it s too bad there were no parades or world of color but there were fireworks every night at ,5,2021-09-01
112,Perfect Time,crowd capacity and ride lines were very low never waited more than minutes for a ride but most waits were closer to minutes masks were required while indoors including indoor rides perfect time to go before the new annual pass system was in effect park was clean and beautiful some food services were not yet available like the breakfast chimichanga ,5,2021-08-26
113,An Expensive Outdated Experience,i had taken my kids to disneyland when they were kids and i have been several times as an adult i can honestly say i was disappointed perhaps it s a long work in progress the new parking garage is a wonderful addition but deleting the monorail into the park makes for a very long walk at the end of your visit the park is always clean and grass is neatly cut the star wars section was a much appreciated addition to the park but it s obvious that is where all of the money has gone definitely some neat additions to this aging park we were thoroughly disappointed on how old the park feels when guests are paying on average of daily for admittance food is horribly overpriced pre packaged reheated garbage and way overpriced cheaply made souvenirs it makes you wonder where all the money is going many of the older rides and attractions are worn out the tiki room has broken birds and needs a complete overhaul i understand it s an older park but your guests are paying you good money for admittance to your park fix it up change it up make it more appealing than just an overpriced out dated amusement park we had to make a reservation for our time in the park not sure why as the park was jam packed full of people we ve been supporters of disney parks for years but this one gets scratched off our list ,2,2021-08-24
114,vacation,so this was my first time here and we had a good time easy to get and find parking signs up to show you where to go it was a long walk to get to the gates we needed a wheelchair and the process was easy going thru the gates went well the park was kept clean staff was very polite and helpful they are very good with handicapped the park is a smaller scale than disney world the park was busy but we got on everything the only thing i did not like was ordering food thru the apps makes it hard when phones freeze up the end of the night fireworks show was good i was very happy they did not have fast passes everyone got in one line and things went smoothly and fast they should get rid of those passes ,5,2021-08-22
115,Horrible customer service,had to cancel due to health issue in our family they refuse to reimburse our money that means they really do not care about people only their business they rather have sick people in the parks they do not care that you are from out of town ,1,2021-08-17
116,It is Disneyland!,i realize young children watch these characters on tv but taking children under years old to a theme park with rides etc may not be the best thing to do yes the disney characters are there and there is toontown and some smaller rides the overall experience will be imo better when children are years old still a great experience either way with covid restrictions you have to download the app and make reservations after purchasing your ticket there are numerous steps to this so be patient ,4,2021-08-17
117,LOVED IT,we are diehard disney world fans so i was not exactly sure what we would think of disneyland but we absolutely loved it other than the tiny castle which we never got used to i think the two parks are very comparable we loved being able to walk into disneyland see the fireworks from our hotel and the lesser crowds highly recommend it ,5,2021-08-16
118,Research before going and you will enjoy it,my family had a wonderful time at the park you just need to do some research before going follow some youtube and instagram accounts of people giving weekly updates about disney i can see some people are writing reviews while frustrated from disney s current situation but i am actually shocked that people are still thinking things will be the same after covid you just need to do your research before going know where to park what to eat how to get into the virtual queue download the disney application and just avoid rides when there are long wait times keep checking when it changes to a convenient wait times disney is still the happiest place on earth but you just need some research ,5,2021-08-16
119,The Happy Place NO Matter your Age,it was my th birthday so we came from oregon to visit our son as a present he took us to the best place on earth not sure how many times i have been to this park at least two dozen time also been to paris singapore hong kong and of course disney world first trip a was around years old with my dad and sister it was magical then and still is today ,5,2021-08-15
120,"Not the ""Happiest Place on Earth.""",we re from canada and our adult family of were so excited to finally travel again one of our favourite places to visit is california and of course disneyland we having been going to disneyland every year since our oldest was she is now the initial process of getting tickets and booking a calendar date was pretty easy our first day that we chose was saturday august th we parked at the mickey parking structure looking forward to taking the tram to the entrance the cost to park was up from the last time we visited after security we started to walk towards the ground floor of the parking structure thinking we would board the trams there surprise there are no trams at all instead you walk of a mile to the entrance and when the park closes at the end of the day you have to walk back of a mile to your car now we are not concerned about the amount of walking if we were we sure wouldn t be going to the park because you do a ton of walking there the reason there are no trams is because and i quote they are broken this was the reason excuse we received when we asked at city hall so you re telling me all their trams are broken hmm so fine we are there at the gates for a m as soon as we got in we went to a few of the rides traditionally with long waits the number of people in the park was less than in the past but there are no fast passes now and the lines were quite long at space mountain min wait indiana jones it was mins cars was min in fact you were waiting a lot in line for rides it was less enjoyable and you waisted a lot of time in line and less on rides we tried the virtual queue that system is near impossible to get through if you were not on and ready at exactly a m you lost any chance of getting through in fact we tried the first day all the spots for star wars were gone in a matter of seconds i m not kidding we tried for spider man at p m got through and our time to board was at p m the funny thing about the boarding time once your group is called you still have to wait in line we waited an hour and forty minutes after our boarding time was called before we got in and the ride is exactly like the toy story ride except instead of shooting balls from a toy gun you are using your hands to shoot webs to kill rogue spiders soooooo not worth the wait in fact the whole avengers camp is such a let down there is nothing there other than web slingers when you go to disneyland expect to wait a lot there are no parades shows or fantasmic there are characters to see but from a distance there are limited restaurants available both in disneyland california disney and downtown disney now disneyland says that there will be some experiences and other things modified or unavailable but i didn t expect to this degree you pay a lot for your admission tickets into the park those have not be modified in price to reflect the amount of experiences they have removed my whole family especially my husband were really disappointed in the lack of the true disneyland experience we have been accustomed too at some point covid cannot be used as an excuse if you can open up the park to guest there is no reason why it cannot be opened up fully if you are still planning on going then here are a few tips we learned on the way park at the toy story parking they have busses that shuttle you to the park make dining reservations well in advance check ahead to see when students are back in school great time to go my daughter went right before we all flew home she said that the kids were in school and wait time was no more that mins on any given ride i should have checked also look at their holiday schedule too prepare to wait in line for food too have a member of your family wait in line and another member get seating seating is at a premium as of right now we will definitely head back down to cali but we won t be going back to disneyland until they can provided their guest with a true disney experience that walt would be proud to put his name on ,3,2021-08-14
121,LOVED IT!!,we normally go to disney world but were so pleasantly surprised with disneyland most of the rides we love but so much smaller park so not so much walking more time to enjoy the rides and california weather is simply amazing going to be hard to go back to florida now ,5,2021-08-10
122,Mouseland West,walt disney s original dream this park is great matterhorn mr toad peter pan pinocchio indiana jones jungle cruise pirates and everything else this park has it all ,5,2021-08-09

124,Wonderful in every way except Virtual Queues,we did one day in disneyland and one in disney s california adventure we liked disneyland much better although a big disappointment was not getting into the virtual queue for the star wars ride we heard it was fantastic but spots were gone in literally second even with the second attempt offered at noon start refreshing the app at am not am we heard that if you go min before the park closes and ask nicely they might let you in anyway the parks were very crowded and no fast passes but the most we waited was minutes first ride of the day on cars single rider line worked well at space mountain splash mountain incredicoaster and cars early in the day splash mountain is a favorite but we really enjoyed every single ride including mr toad and others matterhorn was much more jolting than we remembered the rose and crown was a great lunch stop in disneyland as was flo s in dca ,5,2021-08-02
125,Disney Magic,all these people leaving negative reviews is so frustrating it s a theme park in summer yes there are crowds yes it s expensive is it hot i live in south texas where it is today so quit your complaining we went july after years and my family has still not talking about and missing it we are planning on going back next summer masks or no masks the magic is still there and the food is amazing however if you think you can just show up without planning your crazy learn how to mobile order watch videos on where to get the yummiest food and be prepared to rope drop so you can enjoy rides early then focus on great food and memories for us the the disney magic is definitely back and we plan on going next summer then the following summer again for our anniversary thank you disneyland for an amazing vacation and magical memories,5,2021-07-31
126,Disney strategy different but doable,this is how i made my days amazing rise of the resistance is the best experience ever figure out how to get in the online cue it s like a game start trying seconds before the ride max app was the best before covid it was not very helpful this time although i tried watch your disney app map for ride wait times instead do not park in disney paid parking no tram unless you are a marathon runner and love running around and want to pay we used lyft for about per ride get to the park by go on popular rides until my max wait time is minutes then take a lyft back to your hotel for a nap swim time or go to huntington beach about minutes away come back to disney for the magic of the evening lights without being super tired lyft rideshare pick up from downtown disney is next to the cast parking or turn right and you ll find it it is not in simba parking learned that the hard way lol arrive from lyft on harbor boulevard in the morning ride radiator springs first thing when it opens or plan to wait over an hour all day we did that ride incredicoater midway mania and grizzly falls before use disney photography to take your iconic picture any chance you get when rides get busy shop eat or get a picture you will most likely not have fun doing this later in the end it s the pictures that will tell your story you may get in line for any ride a minute before the park closes and still be able to ride the ride even if the wait is hour it s fun to see it all quiet and closed up too as you exit the park the stores in main street remain open for a while after closing have fun pay attention to all the detail you will not find such a delightful place anywhere and dole whip outside disney is usually yucky see for yourself disney is so good ,5,2021-07-31
127,Not the same Disneyland I remember,so i had not been to disneyland in almost yrs because it s so expensive but after reopening and excited to go out we booked our tickets once there we realized all shows are gone except fireworks of course and then we also found out we can t use fast passes right now so it was all wonderful untill i left my own personal stroller where u leave ur strollers when going on rides and when we came out someone had stolen my stroller with all my belongings as we tried to enjoy the rest of the day i was getting excited to see the best firework show ever and went to look for good seats to find out that now you must pay extra for decent place to watch fireworks or you can watch from main street and then when finally found a spot to watch what a disappointment only min and very basic fireworks and music and lights on castle i remember when it was an actual show with water show classics mickey tinkerbell maleficent was an amazing show unforgettable and now a dud honestly we paid for park hopper was not worth the money and honestly don t know if i want to go back ,3,2021-07-30
128,Covid spreading nightmare,you can read what i wrote about adventure park where we started just too few masks on kids under and not enforced or encouraged to do differently by staff ,1,2021-07-27
129,Not as magical as it should be,we visited disneyland for the first time since it has reopened we arrived at about and the parking garage was backed up there is no tram service to the front of the park so you must walk approximately mile to the park entry screening time was efficient once inside the park there were large crowds fast pass is not available so wait times were often long usually minutes splash mountain was down for a few hours and we heard space mountain was down for a period as well after several rides we were ready for a break for lunch but could not find any open dining spots this was a major disappointment we were forced to get grab and go snacks from carts instead and sit on curbs the parades have not resumed yet and there were no character meet and greets the staff was listless and did not engage in typical disney fashion we stayed until and then had the long walk back to the parking garage we passed elderly people with walkers along the way and just feel disney can do so much better than this overall we felt like we got the rides but not the magic of the disney experience it felt more like six flags ,3,2021-07-26
130,Not Impressed with Disneyland Customer Service,my beef with disneyland is with their customer service a bit of background in early my wife and i purchased hopper tickets for our grandsons their mother and ourselves this was a promised christmas gift for our grandsons we were to fly to disneyland from our home in langley british columbia in early april needless to say these plans were cancelled due to the covid pandemic when the tickets were purchased i got immediate confirmation from disneyland our grandsons were very disappointed by the cancellation but we promised that we d try again in we restarted the process of booking flights and a hotel for a potential trip to anaheim in october but we have not been able to confirm the status of our ticket order of last year and whether disneyland will still honour that confirmed order i have written emails and made numerous telephone calls which from canada can be expensive to date i have not received any response the response given when telephoned is basically that they re too busy to answer the phone and to call back another time we re left hanging in limbo and don t know whether to continue with our plans to go in october we are not impressed with disneyland s customer service ,1,2021-07-23
131,Retreat retreat retreat,wow what a complete disappointment we had to make reservations because of covid you couldn t have got more people in this park with a shoe horn completely packed and degrees and humid big waits on everything signed up for the character breakfast the only issue was there were no characters which the website didn t tell you our server admitted many others read the site the same way we did and were also disappointed even though there were no characters we still paid the big bucks like there was had we known we would have had a free continental breakfast at the hotel what a complete rip off there was also no fast passes available because of covid what canceling fast passes has to do with covid is anyone s guess the walk from the garage to the park is in all seriousness like a mile we needed a shuttle for someone in our party but none were running let me get this straight they pack hundreds of people on the train inside the park sitting right next to each other but hey we can t run the shuttles because of covid the lack of common sense with whoever is making these policies is mind boggling they also had the characters in the park partitioned off because of covid they are in full costumes and the head of the costume is a complete barrier between them and the public this is dollars lost that i will never get back for the worst experience ever at an amusement park ,1,2021-07-20
132,The Magic is Back!!!!!!!!!,this is the og often imitated never duplicated disneyland i had hot been there since march that was the day of closure my eyes welled up with tears after walking in thankfully california allowed out of state visitors visit disneyland i saw lots of characters enjoyed gluten free food and visited lots of attractions ,5,2021-07-17
133,The saddest place on Earth,went with my family july th it was extremely crowded lines were an hour plus multiple rides broke the anticipated web slinger ride broke times while we were in line resulting in a hour wait after waiting in the online que for hours we finally got on the ride it broke down more times we never got to complete the ride we wasted hours of our day and the best they could do was offer fast pass for that ride if they could get it fixed before closing so we spent a ton of money only got to ride rides that day water all of our time with zero effort from the staff to make it right a crying year old an overwhelming feeling of being ripped off and a bad taste in our mouth for the happiest place on earth there are virtually no shows and no character interaction at all save your money ,2,2021-07-17
134,Come back its so nice to be home again.,as always we love the parks and the staff so glad we can be here again this is my happy place going to be back in aug a year away from here was heck thank you for opening again ,5,2021-07-17
135,Way Too Crowded,we went on july and th it could not have been packed tighter in the parks if they tried from a covid perspective the rule is that you only need a mask if you are unvaccinated but virtually no one had their mask on including kids it s a covid outbreak waiting to happen besides the covid factor the crowds impacted the experience itself enormously waits for everything including food fighting to walk through crowds to go everywhere it just felt gross and not magical at all the only redeeming thing is the rides themselves once you can finally get on them it s obviously a good time but i don t know if it s worth it ,2,2021-07-12
136,"I really love Disneyland, but……",my husband took me to disneyland for my birthday and i can t believe i m writing this i don t normally write reviews but there are some things that happened to us that need to be told we arrived at the mickey and friends parking lot and after going through the security check we realized that there was no tram to take you from the parking lot to the park there was absolutely nothing about this anywhere on their website i m in okay shape but i have arthritis in both knees and after walking the mile to the park i was spent before i even got in the park how could they not inform people that there isn t a tram ahead of time i felt sorry for the people who brought their elderly parents or people with limited capabilities these people were forced to rent a scooter for each just to get to the park next we were excited about going on the new star wars rise of the resistance ride but you need to enter a queue at am to see if you can reserve a space what they don t tell you is that you have less than seconds to get a space or you don t get in my husband and i both tried together exactly at and in less than seconds we were rejected we tried again at and same thing in less than seconds it was over we were sitting in the mexican restaurant with about other people who also didn t get in me on my birthday in my star wars t shirt at disneyland and i can t even get on the one ride we came for this queue was bulls t they act like it s super easy to join a queue on the app but it s really misleading and it s impossible they made it so everything has to be done thought the app which for me was okay but if you re not that computer savvy you re in big trouble we couldn t even walk up and order a dole whip without the app disneyland is no longer for the whole family and especially not for anyone over i saw whole families spending more time looking at their phones than spending time having fun at the park i gave disneyland stars because the second day we spent at california adventure and we were finally able to get in the queue and get in a group to go on the new web slinger ride this ride was really great and the interaction was impressive since there is no fast passes or max pass the wait for the radiator springs racers was minutes we went on as single riders so at least we wouldn t miss going on that i really did my homework before we went and we still weren t prepared enough i don t think we will be going there again anytime soon and i absolutely love disneyland i might consider it if family come to visit but it s going to take a lot too bad i probably will never get a chance to ride that ride ,2,2021-07-10
137,Disgusting renovations and staff,this is one of the worst outcomes of any management changes and renovations i ve ever seen the staff are deeply fake and insincere wierd we all have to take our families to disney i get it but there s really nothing left of the real disneyland and them playing the covid card is just a convenience for them to blame it on it s no excuse they destroyed all the history and the insides of all these places no longer fit the architects rendition of what was built ,1,2021-07-08
138,Does NOT get better than Disneyland,so glad to be back place was busy but lines were manageable miss fastpass and over three days wasn t able to get in the star wars virtual q it fills up in literal seconds but still the best place in the world peter pan is always worth the wait ,5,2021-07-08
139,Great day,my husband loves disneyland but i refuse to go during the summer because i can t stand the crowds we usually go a week or two before thanksgiving however since the park was supposed to be operating at and was only open to california residents i surprised him with tickets for his birthday in may tickets are sold on a tier system with different prices for different days i had to buy the tickets then make a reservation we chose july and were charged per ticket we parked at the anaheim hotel on harbor blvd just across the street from the entrance to the parks the cost was but it was worth it because the trams were not running at the disney friends parking lot and i think it was mile walk just to get to the gate we got in line at the gate at a m at am they started letting people in the lines moved slowly because you had to show your tickets but not your reservation and they took a picture of you we were so excited to be inside before a m but when we got to main street they held us there until a m we immediately walked to the indiana jones ride with lots of other people the line was long but it moved continuously so it wasn t bad just before we got to the ride it stopped working we waited for about minutes and then it started running again it was super fun we walked to pirates of the caribbean next the line was shorter and it only took us about minutes to get on the ride the ride stopped for about minutes but then continued we went to the haunted mansion next and there was no line however the ride stopped for a few minutes but then continued next we rode splash mountain the line went super fast i sat in the front of the first log and got completely soaked luckily it was a warm day so it kept me cool we explored the new star wars area which was very cool i am not a star wars fan but if you like the movies you will probably recognize lots of things from the movies we were not able to get into the virtual queue for the rise of the resistance the line for the other ride was minutes so we walked back to ride the thunder mountain railroad the sign said there was a minute wait but the line moved the whole time and i think it was only about a minute wait we ordered lunch at the french market restaurant while we were waiting on main street before a m we chose the noon window we got to the restaurant at and discovered that we could have just walked up and made our choices at the buffet we found a table and i went to the window to let them know we were there they didn t make us wait and we had our lunch in about minutes my husband ordered the clam chowder and the jambalaya both were very good i ordered the herb roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and roasted broccoli the chicken and broccoli were very good but the mashed potatoes and gravy were amazing we caught the train to tomorrowland to ride space mountain but it wasn t running we rode star tours which they have updated since the last time we visited the wait was not very long and the updated ride was awesome we rode astro blaster and then went back to the star wars area and waited minutes to ride the millennium falcon smugglers run it was good but we enjoyed star tours more we checked the app and discovered that space mountain was up and running again we went back and waited minutes it was a long wait but the ride is fantastic we were exhausted and left by p m because my husband is a musician and had a show the next day also the electric light parade and fireworks were not scheduled to start again until july th if you go be sure to download the app to try to get in the virtual queue for the rise of the resistance ride and to check the wait times for the the rides and to see what is running overall it was a very good day and i am glad we went the park was busy and there was no social distancing and very few people were wearing masks they did not wipe down the rides after each guest ,4,2021-07-06
140,MUST GO VISIT NOW!,best time to visit is now that is if you re comfortable with the being around people and crowds with the reservation system limited capacity and no fast passes this all makes visiting now so worth it longest wait for a ride was around minutes and that only applied to of the rides most were below minutes and some were less than it wasn t even crowded in the parks felt so nice to walk around without pushing and shoving against each other at times you can actually enjoy the park for what it is instead of spending the day standing in line after line waiting to ride something for a few minutes we came july nd and th had a park hopper but didn t even use it need it the only reason i got it was the reservation system for some reason only allowed me to reserve disneyland as a first park on the th with a park hopper vs a single park pass i guess that s one way disney is making up their losses from last year at this time the park hopper only gives you access to the second park after pm the same day so even though the park is not full or crowded the lines are still jammed with people when you get to the inside part of the line so there is no ft rule being enforced it s totally up to you if you want to try and stand ft from others but it s next to impossible so if you re not yet comfortable with this you can wear a mask of course if that doesn t work for you then it may not be a good time for you to come now for the ride reviews two really rise of the resistance second best ride ever i still put avatar flight of passage as my number one ride i would say this is more than a ride though it s an experience the amount of work disney put into this ride and the whole set is amazing its as if you re on in the movie set things look so real because the sets are real sets built to perfection also the animatronics in some of the characters are very lifelike it s spooky some of the disney cast were really into it and others weren t so that was hit or miss i think having the cast play a more integrated role makes the experience so much better i guess some of there were just having a bad day having to work on the fourth this is a ride you need to ride multiple times but of course with the virtual queue system in place because of the pandemic you can only ride once a day but i did overhear a couple who were talking as if they had rode it quite a number of times not sure how they did it maybe an annual pas holder or something web slingers this is pretty cool given the motion capture used to track the web shooting from your hands i didn t see what all the hype was that put in the bucket of needing a virtual queue in place for it seemed like a new take on the shoot em up and collect points ride that disney has a lot of galaxy s edge is the best part of disney now its truly immersive in that it makes you feel like you re in another world if they can transform all the other areas of disneyland into this type of experience immersion then it s game over i kinda just wanted to hang out there all day but couldn t as we had other things we needed to do and see ,4,2021-07-05
141,A Truly Magical Place,we were so happy to come to this park on june when the mask mandates were lifted for the vaccinated out of state guests with the reduced capacity social distancing was automatic except for the lines as we were waiting for the rides but fortunately the lines were not too long and the pace was fast with our hopper tickets we were able to visit both the theme park and the avenger campus and rode all the rides that we wanted to go on all the employees were welcoming and pleasant we got a chuckle when the security guard asked us if were carrying any poison apples or pixie dust as they checked our pocket books and back packs we arrived as soon as they opened and were done by about p m after walking through each and every area it was fantastic to stroll down main street and actually see and admire the beautiful buildings without the mega crowds coming in the way of your pictures photo ops with the characters in different areas were socially distanced and we actually preferred it this way parades and performances were very minimal with a few characters but it is the pandemic so we have to take what we get to keep everybody safe the restaurants have outdoor seating but with very little shade we had lunch at the pizza planet and they did the best they could to provide as many umbrellas as possible bathrooms were super clean with employees constantly there to wipe down sinks and counters and maintain adequate supplies sanitizing stations were all over the place even all the way down to the parking lot there are no charging stations for phones we came with fully charged phones plus carried solar and battery chargers with us so we were fine remember you will need the phones to check on the availability of the rides and for ordering your food in advance we had a wonderful time under all the restrictive circumstances and returned home tired but extremely satisfied with our experience ,5,2021-07-02
142,Tips and Observations from June 25th Visit + Virtual Queue tips,here are the tips we compiled from our mostly enjoyable visit to disneyland on friday june th we got on rides including rise of the resistance and had an overall nice time with some awkward or tense moments due to various covid protocols drive or hotel we chose to stay at a hotel across harbor blvd expensive but so convenient so we didn t have to drive early in the morning and walk from parking structure trams still not running also it made it easy to roll out of bed and get a virtual queue boarding pass for rise of the resistance tips at the bottom and eat breakfast without worrying about rushing security to get into the park we arrived at am for a am opening time lots of security lines available very short waits they fixed whatever was wrong on that day when the marvel campus opened possible early entry into the parks to avoid having people stand in unorganized lines outside the gate that would back up into the plaza or the bus area they just let people into the park as they arrived at some point before we arrived they had already let people into the lands and people were already on rides we did the newly renovated snow white the renovated carousel and big thunder before the official opening time the early bird catches the worm masks very few people are wearing masks given that about of californians are not fully vaccinated it is highly likely that unvaccinated people are milling around you full rides they shoved the rides full of people on pirates of the caribbean we were seated in row behind a bunch of large adults i felt compelled to wear a mask even though i am vaccinated after all these months the thought of riding through the expirations of all those screaming lungs was uncomfortable felt the same way on star tours but everyone was having fun which was nice to see mobile ordering our experience with mobile ordering was that the food was ready in the timeframe they said sometimes earlier sometimes immediately we had one snag with pickup because the person in front of us in the pickup line had a ginormous order of meals which weren t ready when the got there outdoor seating there isn t much indoor seating so finding a table in the shade before you order or while you are waiting for your food is a good idea you may have to stalk people who are about to leave uncomfortable but necessary to get a table the heat will get worse as the summer progresses drink lots of water bring a water bottle to fill i forgot mine wear hats food cart experience the food carts in the streets churros ice cream etc are now a two step experience you place your order at one station where someone behind plexiglass takes your order with contactless payment then another person behind plexiglass who hands out the drinks or food or whatever gets a receipt printed at their location and they give you your food it s awkward because visitors aren t expecting this so the workers spend their day dealing with people who are confused all the vending carts are like this even the balloons these workers seemed to be among the most tense feel bad for them i don t know how long they ll be doing it this way check the app from time to time for rides that are opened or closed they are opening things quietly so they don t cause a stampede for example the buzz lightyear ride was set to reopen the day after our visit but it had a soft opening while were there and showed up on the app subdued environment except for some tension due to all of these protocols the ambience is a bit subdued in disneyland people stick with their groups and don t chat in line you are missing a lot of sounds like the shows parades characters the monorail the sounds of thousands of people talking etc you can actually hear the soundtrack in all the lands really clearly getting a virtual queue slot this advice should work for any attraction with a virtual queue in either park make sure that the tickets for everyone in your party is linked to the one account that will sign up for the virtual queue if you ordered all of the tickets at the same time online on one account they are already linked if they were ordered separately you have to link them manually to one account go into disneyland app click the three bars on the lower right to bring up menu options click virtual queues then click join boarding group it will say something like not boarding or boarding groups to about or minutes before the signup time which was am on the day of the ticket this page will then say that signups for rise of the resistance or marvel campus if you have a ticket for that park will begin at am or whatever time have someone else pull up the world clock on their phone a world clock that has a second hand counting down tripadvisor does not allow posting of link here as soon as you see the clock reach am or whatever time the signup is immediately i mean immediately refresh the virtual queue signup screen on your app practice refreshing in advance by going to the virtual queue page as explained above and then swiping your finger down the screen and letting go the screen will update and show you the time you updated so when the clock strikes am or whatever do this refreshing immediately then keep hitting the join a boarding group button i think that s what it s called hit it repeatedly until you get a new screen that asks you to confirm your party your reservation etc just hit the confirming buttons for whatever shows up on your screen as quickly as possible you can address any mistakes with guest relations later you only have about seconds to get a group and then the screen confirms that you are in a boarding group you need to show your boarding pass on your phone to get into the attractions i accomplished all of this in seconds and got boarding group out of i m old and i did it no time to waste you snooze you lose stressful they give you two chances per day early morning and early afternoon have fun ,4,2021-06-27
143,The Magic is truly here!,just came back from a fantastic trip to disneyland anaheim ca usa my first with my two kids aged and loved the rides the arrangements in general sanitizer stations every feet before and after every ride clockwork like precision with which rides and lines are run extremely helpful and friendly employees virtual booking for food is a bonus didn t like too much price of the food and drinks vegetarian choices are available unlike universal which has absolutely zero choices universal vs disney another review night shows and fireworks were cancelled because of covid but i see why people come back again and again rides not for the faint hearted incredi coaster guardians of the galaxy millenium falcon smugglers run space mountain splash mountain just enough thrills to be enjoyable but not scary big thunder mountain railroad grizzly river run autopia radiator spring racers goofy s sky school silly symphony indiana jones soaring around the world star tours the adventure continues can skip haunted mansion its a small world after all maybe very young kids will like it little mermaid maybe very young kids will like it monsters inc mr toad s wild ride easy rides must dos inside out emotional whirlwind pirates of the carriberan animatronics not scary jumping jelly fish king arthur carousel luigi s rolicking roadsters mad tea party mater s junkyard jamboree peter pan s flight toy story midway mania lines were very short on most of the rides minutes except for the really scary ones which would go from hours not sure if this was because of covid or if that s the norm we rode a lot of the rides multiple times it took us days to cover all of magic kingdom and california adventure each we took a park hopper ticket for all days but should have taken individual for days and park hopper only for day could have save some money that way next time ,5,2021-06-26
144,Disneyland ticket price,disneyland ticket price is really high for anyone when you know that universal annual is less than one day spending in disneyland you feel does it really worth to visit disneyland i was an annual pass holder last year and it was already expensive you really got frustrated to know that they plan to roar their annual price as well i have a family of four it cost a fortune to either go one day or to do annuals i don t think we will go to disneyland anymore ,1,2021-06-26
145,Disappointed in Disney,i m a disney lover and supporter and i ve been a lifelong annual visitor so i understand wanting to keep some original and endearing pieces of walts vision alive in the park but theres too many missed opportunities here imagine keeping autopia there but paint and decorate the area in a wreck it ralph theme sugar rush racers cars pinocchio or mr toads wild ride updated so its fun and light and happy not loud dark scary especially since that area is supposed to be for very young children mr toads ride drives you literally through hell how is this fun for a year old wheres movie themed rides for mulan pocahontas beauty and the beast moana etc keep the rides and building in tact but update the themes already on its a small world imagine the last part thats just black walls if it was full of disney characters or at least mickey n minnie stylized in the rest of the rides costumes merchandising is awful as well cheaply made with flimsy plastic now and no imagination or idea of what kids want to play with disney gets away with being lazy and cutting corners because parents and people of all ages will still hand over money at least sell some alcohol there for parents to deal with the stress of everything and the fact they re spending on stuffed ears that wont even make it to the next visit because they fall apart ,4,2021-06-26
146,Thrilled it's open again but new virtual queing stinks,it was wonderful to stroll mainstreet seeing lots of characters out and about in both parks unfortunately several attractions are closed and they seem a bit understaffed at the moment the biggest disappointment was the replacement of fast passes with a complicated virtual queuing system that requires a smartphone and app there is nowhere at the parks to charge a phone but your need your phone to order food at the park you look at your phone to be notified of wait times and to see when your virtual queueing group is ready so sadly many people are walking just looking at their phones which creates a lot of slow foot traffic ,3,2021-06-25
147,A good day,the art bus from area hotels to disney no longer accepted paper tickets or cash you had to download app pay with cc and use phone for boarding the bus alien pizza and rose tavern accepted walkups for lunch so you could pay with cc or cash to make it hard for guests they staffed it with only one cashier the wait in line was mins but immediately received your food toy story and jungle cruise rides were shut indef for some unknown reason a worker took pity i did not have a phone with me and gave a boarding time for rise of the resistance this ride is way over the top the ror ride moved on magnets and one part lifts your cart up on a elevator while in motion for how great you might think this ride is it is more than that the park was very busy and cannot imagine what its like at full capacity all other rides were operational with long lines ,4,2021-06-23
148,"Rip Off, NOT Clean, Hard to eat anywhere, 1 hour Lines everywhere, not fun anymore",worst trip i ve ever had to this place do not go here until they figure out a better way to treat the guests and to deliver what your paying top dollar for i live an hour from it so i ve always bought annual passes so you can pay for them in monthly installments and it takes the pressure off feeling obligated to spend the whole day at the park if it happens to have hr wait times or too many broken rides which is almost always the case but since they canceled the annual passes for covid related financial gain as if they aren t the richest most greedy corporation on earth already i decided to go ahead and pay the insanely priced one day tickets for our family because they said they were only allowed to have the park at capacity until june th and i figured there will never again be a time when they are forced to keep the capacity that low and it would give my very young kids ages and a chance to go on rides without standing in hour lines so i thought this is a worth while opportunity just for that so i payed that crazy fortune just for one day when we got there we had to pay just to park the car then after endless driving in the parking structure walk quite a ways to the gun and bomb detection process and be sniffed by bomb detector dogs walk through metal detectors and have our bags searched really welcoming and lovely for the kids then walk miles in the burning sun because tram rides are no longer offered before finally reaching the down town disney strip by then it was am and we were sweaty and hungry we used to always first eat at the la brea bakery before entering the park it used to be casual and quick you could order at the counter to get coffee and a sandwich so we went there but it was all different and found out you have to download an app find that restaurant in a long list download the menu through a qr code order and pay through the phone then get a notification of a minute time frame in which your food will be ready then be there to wait in a line of people that are waiting for they re food within that same estimated time frame which defeats the purpose of trying to avoid people wing close together in lines so dumb so it took us minutes just to get our food after all those steps we had a salad a kids meal a soda and one sandwich for it s just so wrong on so many levels to charge people those prices for so little food so after all that it s about noon now and my kids are already tired and cranky and we haven t even started in the parks yet when we entered it was packed beyond belief like filled to capacity not the limit we paid for the wait times for each ride was about hour it was so jammed up it was hard to walk around if you wanted to get an ice cream or treat in california adventure you had to go through the whole same stupid song and dance of ordering through the app and waiting in a long line so messed up that we just skipped the treats which are a huge part of the fun for the kids then on the maybe rides i actually got my kids onto the whole day i noticed that not on any of them were the staff even wiping any hand rails or seats down with soap not once the seat safety bars felt grimy and dirty the seats felt gross it is such a sham i saw no covid standard cleaning at all yet if any of us pulled our mask down a little to get some air on our sweaty faces or to breathe better the workers there would be on top of us telling us to please put the mask back on and offering masks in packets but as for cleaning the rides not once did i see any cleaning happening just the standard sweeping the grounds that you normally see and if you wanted to sit down somewhere to rest guess what all the benches have signs no sitting allowed so bad after a long disappointing day of not being able to take them on most of the rides because of the min wait times for everything and barely being able to buy treats or food without spending an hour to get each thing as we had to stand in designated pre order through app pick up line for each snack so to substitute the kids sadness that they couldn t go on most of the rides we bought them a few toys at the shops for just to get two head bands two minnie stuffed dolls and a key chain oh and at when it finally mellowed out because people were leaving and i could get them onto the small world ride which they loved the park closed early at they really wanted to ride it again but i had to say no sorry kids now the park is closed they just cried and cried so sad then we got to walk back for miles after hours if not being able to sit anywhere or rude most of the park our feet were just killing us and it felt like it never ended it was the biggest a bummer and waste of for one day of disappointment i would not recommend going to this hell hole they do not care about they re guests or their kids happiness one bit and it shows everywhere only profit i am going to try to get a refund because we barely got to do anything there because they lied and filled the place up to capacity horrible place so disappointing for all of us ,1,2021-06-23
149,Disney needs time to heal,i have to say that even this old master chief curmudgeon loves disney i have been to disneyland disneyworld and eurodisney it has always been a special and happy place when it s in full swing the cast is always friendly even when your not and the place is just magical those of you that have experienced it know of what i speak i say all that to forewarn you that is not the current experience disney just is not recovered from covid they have open the gates to but a large number of services shops restaurants are closed making eating or getting a drink a challenge so bring your own in fact stop at a grocery and pick up food and drinks and pack for the day the dinning experience is nightmarish and frustrating epcot is under construction and very over crowded most of space mountain rides were closed no fireworks limited parades and a number of shows and rides are closed the ones that are open have no fast passes and are crowded those that are open are great as usual go see frozen it s amazing and animal kingdom seems to have most things working if you re going to come soon keep these things in mind maybe later disney to will recover from covid on the bright side shades of green was great and disney magic still comes through now and again get well soon disney ,3,2021-06-19
150,Buyer Beware. Purchasing tickets does not guarantee you will be able to get reservations,buyer beware just because you purchase tickets does not mean you will be able to make reservations to the park i purchased day tickets and was only able to make reservations to one park reservations never opened up to the second park so my tickets for the second day expired i tried calling for weeks to be told by the automated system to try back at a later time the supervisor rachel kept repeating that it says online that purchases are not guaranteed so if purchases are not guaranteed keep your hard earned money to spend elsewhere they gave me a partial refund that is no where near enough to buy tickets for a later day ,1,2021-06-19
151,First Visit,had our first visit with yr old granddaughter we had a park hopper and entered shortly after pm we didn t worry with trying to get rise of the resistance and just focused on exploring all the other areas of the park even with splitting the day and only having day we saw ate everything on our to do list and then some we save the stress of rotr and fully enjoyed the rides we did trans are not currently running so be aware of the hike from the parking garage to the parks it feels like double the distance when walking back after a long day at the park especially important for those with little ones ,5,2021-06-19
152,Truly the Happiest Place on Earth,went for my wives birthday and it was epic the park was at at reduced capacity but it was so much fun it is a trip that neither of us will ever forget ,5,2021-06-15
153,Missing the Magic :-(,let me start with the positives the sun was shining and it was degrees star wars campus is awesome and the attractions were great now for the negatives the virtual queue is good in theory could be really maddening if you can t get in google how to get in and follow the instructions we weren t able to get in at the am one but did get into the pm one once inside the park we would have been extremely mad if we hadn t been able to get on that ride disney should make sure everyone gets a chance to get on the mask nazis were out in full force not being able to put your mask down when you were the only people on a ride was ridiculous or not being able to take a drink of water or eat a snack in line was obnoxious photo pass was not worth it there weren t many official photographers out and when we did find one the line was too long we figured we d be able to get photos on rides but there are only that have it one of them is on splash mountain on which my son s mask became soaked so he took it off so he could breathe the photo pass people deleted our photo because he was displaying unsafe behavior on an attraction what i m sorry but that is just ridiculous you had to make reservations for things as simple as ice cream at least minutes in advance lots of stands and multiple restaurants were closed completely the walk from the parking garage to the park was really long we were okay but if you had little ones you can expect lots of complaining no shows or fireworks in summary the magic was definitely missing and i would not recommend anyone going until things are back up to normal not worth the that you pay to get a family in for the day for sure ,2,2021-06-14
154,Pro Tips for June 2021, family of yo sons we were really glad we brought an external battery pack for each person s phone we didn t see any charging options except at bathrooms you need the disney app for everything at disney so your phone is used a lot reusable water bottle was great except finding water refill options was not easy but easier than waiting minutes in line to purchase a water bottle mom yo arrived at the park at am and there were already hundreds of people in line ahead of us dad yo met us around am the park did open early and we were glad felt like it was worth it that we d arrived early rides once in the park disneyland the first day ca adventure the second day we went straight to more popular longer wait time rides at disney we chose indiana jones and pirates of the caribbean if we had it to do again we would not choose indiana jones first because they later had a virtual cue indie virtual cue doesn t open until lines are too long so don t worry like we did if you can t get a virtual cue when you arrive we got in the pm virtual cue for star wars and all thought the ride was great at ca adventure the line for avengers world and cars land were already long crowded yes this was with us arriving at am to get in line if these hadn t been crowded we would ve done either first but we kept going and we went straight to the toy story ride which was totally empty as was the incredi coaster and the inside out ride the swings jellyfish and rocket weren t open yet and none of us wanted to do the ferris wheel but there was also no line for the ferris wheel virtual cues the tip that seemed to work for us was get the official anaheim world clock on your phone and pull down refresh the virtual cue option on the app at exactly and seconds and register as fast as your fingers will let you this method worked for us to get in on the spiderman webslinger ride which my yo loved but we would ve been pretty bummed to wait in the hour stand by ride for food beverages our experience was that if you did not have a mobile order there was no option or work around no one would help us since some food had sold out before we figured out we missed out on the dole whip once food was ordered on the mobile app it was possible to cancel the order at any time up until the time window that the food was ordered what we did the second day and would do next time the first day had we known was order a meal from every section of the park for any time you might possibly be hungry and then cancel if you don t want it this way we weren t walking totally out of our way just to get food because nothing else is available also the cast members were usually able to prepare food minutes before after the time window and kindly added additional items to our order and that seemed to be less of an inconvenience for them than removing items but the one time i asked to remove an item they took care of that too cast member were great helpful every time disney had a few carts serving churros and bottled beverages with optional walk up order lines but that s it all other options needed to be done virtually the dole whip and other options from this shop was sold out by am many of the popular options had a hour time delay so we ended up walking out of our way to get food when hungry the most enjoyable healthy option we found were the vegetable chicken and beef skewers in adventure land i think at bengal bbq but can t remember the name for sure ca adventure had a few more options for walk up and pay meals and a lot less options for refilling water we all enjoyed the tacos ice cream did not sell out was easy to order last minute at either park the train ride at disneyland that has an entrance at the beginning of the park stops at a few different worlds near new orleans toon town and tomorrow land you can get off at any of the stops but many don t get off until the entrance so don t count on getting back on but useful to zip to the back of the park at the beginning of the day and useful to go out at the very end of the day if at the back of the park and tired of walking ,3,2021-06-10
155,Wait to go,definitely should have waited to go till they figure out the food and line situation i did tons of research ahead of time and understood well how to use the app and it was still a pretty miserable experience we re booking adjusting and canceling food orders all day in an attempt to ensure we would be able to get food when we wanted it and we still ended up going hungry the mobile order system is such a pain don t plan on being able to get any food ordered between pm and there are no walk up lines available and it s lines lines lines everywhere for everything no space to sit anywhere to rest or eat and some of the most popular rides are down for refurbishment with all the waiting plus the park closing early it s completely not worth the money to go right now it felt just as busy as any peak day in summer at capacity ,2,2021-06-08
156,Walt would have been disappointed,well to quote my son walt would have been disappointed we just got back from two days at disneyland we re big fans and have been going for years i checked out vlogs prior to the trip and felt i was prepared i usually get the military hoppers but they weren t available and tickets were high so i got disney only tickets we are star wars fans and we fully expected to ride the rise of the resistance at least once but no the only resistance we got was the ability to get in the que the que system is a terrible idea and the person who thought of it should get their fired we tried both days at a m and noon to no avail indiana jones was the same apparently what you have to do to get a ride is have all six members of your family on their smart phones trying to get into the que at the same time food is another thing you can t just go up to the counter for food i expected that you have gather your group decide where and what you want to eat that morning once you all decide on a place pick a time and pay for it all on your smart phone the popular places get booked up and then you re aol i spent more time on my iphone than on the rides i didn t see the capacity i expected it seemed there were many more people with social distancing the lines were long i realize we are in the midst of a pandemic but i wish i would ve waited ,2,2021-06-04
157,Walt would be so very very sad!,let me begin by saying we have always loved going to disneyland park we have been regular visitors for over years from when my daughter was young she is now in her thirties and has two children of her own we followed disney s rules purchased tickets for adults for kids made the required reservations and were so excited to be going to disneyland on june st this was the grandkid s first visit got there around parking was a bit confusing and then the loop thru the temperature check and tsa style search took a little while but it was ok the tram is not running so you need to walk the tram route to get into the park and it s not a short walk success we got in the entrance line around pulled up our reservations on the app but no one checked or seemed to care about our reservations just that we had tickets by am the park was already starting to get packed and we were really confused when we purchased tickets and made our reservations we were told the park would only be opening for capacity great right but it was definitely not limited to or even it seemed as crowded as the days we had gone and the park was near full capacity at first it didn t seem too bad some of the little kid s rides were not too long of a wait but by the times were already very long for popular rides min hours if you could even book a spot to be able to go on a couple of the rides we were confused at the chaos and several cast members even confirmed that since restrictions were being lifted in ca they decided to start easing restrictions on park capacity and told us it was way more than as stated when we made reservations and they also seemed overwhelmed by it we specifically went hoping to feel more comfortable going during covid because it was supposed to be capacity we decided to get a bite to eat and rest a bit around but wait you have to log into the disney app on your phone and try to find a restaurant that you can book an appointment time to pick up food we had heard that some were going to require reservations but it seemed all did and with so many restaurants closed this was no easy feat several mishaps and missed opportunities later we were able to make a food appointment at galactic grill notify them we were in the area and then wait until they messaged us that we could come to get our food we were able to finally eat around oh look nowhere to sit but as luck had it someone was leaving and we scored a table food was cold burgers tasted like they were warmed up leftovers from the previous day and our order messed up s later we finished quickly to allow other people that were standing around looking for a table to have our spot we decided to see if any ride times had shortened nope so we ducked into the candy palace we wanted some of the toffee we saw them making earlier in the day by the way the people making candy always were so cheerful in the past and would wave at you and sometimes give you a sample nope they didn t even look up and make eye contact we were going to get the grandson a giant mickey mouse cookie but the person working there said they don t make those there and suggested a couple of other things that they do instead they used to have fudge and all sorts of candies and stuff but there was none of that we often get new coffee mugs on our visit but decided to pass on this too as they were charging a mug all of this was too much and made us very sad we had been pass holders for many years and used to go there at least once a month and it was never as confusing and messed up as it was this trip why check people s temps and get after them for taking their mask down for a recognizable pic when it was so crowded that you couldn t have distanced a foot away from others let alone feet away and why make people hike a mile in and out of the park because you don t have trams running you care that people are close on a tram but you don t care that they are literally rubbing elbows in the park we ended up leaving way earlier than planned because of this it saddens me that this was my grandson s first time there and we wanted it to be more special for him i don t think this is right and after spending over for about park hours it was a mediocre experience and that s being generous wading through many grouchy disgruntled people including employees terrible food that was hard to come by and overpriced snacks and merchandise it definitely was a rip off which is my reason for the title i ve contacted disney several times but have received no answer except the canned response about how busy they are helping other people and will get to me when they can i think we are owed some sort of reimbursement for being lied to and tricked about the reservations and capacity or at the very least an explanation as to why this was allowed to happen ,1,2021-06-04
158,"STAY HOME - long lines, bad food, no trams, lots of ""mask police""",horrible experience food is awful and you need to order on the app and wait over hours long lines everywhere no trams so you walk a mile from parking garage very crowded most employees are empowered mask police ,1,2021-06-04
159,Dont visit if you're from a Red State,felt great to be back unfortunately the staff is constantly harassing you with your masks you cannot even sip water and walk at the same time they have designated areas for eat and drink but its super crowded so their covid policy makes no sense food took hours to be ready we cancelled eventually download the disneyland app if you want to order food or drinks,2,2021-06-04
160,👎👎👎👎👎,copy pasted this review because i had the same experience on june rd very disappointed with disneyland no shows no parades unhappy employees impossible to get food at pm at some venues star wars queue not working on my phone so no star wars and no indiana jones waste of money went home early do not go until after june th churros gone wait times over hours disgruntled employees no dining reservations food sold out before pm rides breaking down constantly does this sound like an experience worth over per person that s what we dealt today the park is joyless everyone is angry and it s only going to get worse when the too small avengers campus land is opened wait until more staff comes back and they can allow indoor queuing trust me it s just not worth it right now this is from someone whose been going to disneyland for over years ,1,2021-06-03
161,Wait!!,do not go until after june th churros gone wait times over hours disgruntled employees no dining reservations food sold out before pm rides breaking down constantly does this sound like an experience worth over per person that s what we dealt today the park is joyless everyone is angry and it s only going to get worse when the too small avengers campus land is opened wait until more staff comes back and they can allow indoor queuing trust me it s just not worth it right now this is from someone whose been going to disneyland for over years ,1,2021-06-01
162,Pixie Dust Magical,a fabulously fun way to indulge an inner child disneyland has an absolutely amazing team working round the clock to make this truly magical place come alive ,5,2021-05-30
163,Blah....,i booked a disneyland reservation online with covid you must book a reservation and a park ticket you could not go without a reservation i made sure that i booked the disneyland reservation not the california adventure since your tickets could go to either park but the reservation must specify which park and which date you want to go to because of covid i had ensure several times that my reservation was for disneyland not california but unfortunately when we came there they said that my reservation was for caliornia not disneyland so weird perhaps instead of kicking me off the system they just booked me for california adventure since that was what was available their internet user interface is extremely confusing when i got there with my kids in person i could not change to go to disneyland and was stuck having to go to ca adventure since there is a maximum capacity at each park despite covid the park was still crowded and the waits were just as long if not longer if you are looking to go during covid and think there will be less lines think again same long lines and less flexibility no park hopping between the two parks no fast pass service not all rides open i regret going during this initial opening during covid thinking that there somehow be less people i never cared for dizzy land to begin with and if it wasn t for the kids insistence i would stay clear ,2,2021-05-23
164,Angry employees,the park isn t the same there is a very negative vibe the employees are really aggressive and angry to buy food or drinks you must buy it through the app there are very very limited seating throughout the park the park is extremely crowded i went on wednesday may the reservation and tickets were sold at a capacity not true it was packed a lot of what they had in place didn t make any sense no seating and no parking for strollers extremely limited parking i was blown away at the way they had everyone enter the park it s a good mile miles on a long narrow road after you leave they user you into one parking structure on one level this disoriented a huge amount of people people could not find there car no security of any kind in the parking structure or park please know going into this place it s very very different the pros are the park was beautiful everything looked new and painted and well kept up and maintained so very disappointed on the parks re opening ,2,2021-05-22
165,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,i ve been going to disneyland for years and i ve never been so appalled by their customer service you now must buy a ticket then reserve which day you re going which is fine but the system is faulty we saw that a day was open for park reservations and bought tickets only to find that once we bought the tickets the system insisted that the day was no longer available even though it was still open on page that shows availability well that s the only day my family could go so we had lost over on tickets but it shouldn t be a problem with a wealthy well run company to fix the situation with customer service right wrong i called times waiting on hold for minutes each time before the system hung up on me dropping my place in the queue after finding no other way to fix the problem on the website or way to contact customer service i wrote them a desperate email two weeks later i just got an email back saying that they can t do anything for me over email and i must call again disney is not worth the headache and doesn t care about its customers there is no magic just a money hungry company save yourself a headache and take your family elsewhere ,1,2021-05-21
166,Still fun since 1955!,i m a legacy visitor first visited in changes have occurred some attractions have been removed remember the flying saucers and the park is continually updated new fantasyland and now star wars great for all ages ,5,2021-05-19
167,Happy the Magic is Back,we took a family vacation with our two teens during the first weekend after opening even though a few activities weren t being offered it was still magical the lines for rides were around minutes food was easy to pickup the staff were wonderful and mask and social distancing were politely enforced i m glad i took the time to get tickets ,5,2021-05-17
168,THE WOKEST PLACE ON EARTH,disneyland has surrendered its title of being the happiest place on earth and has now become the wokest place on earth i was excited to take my husband for our wedding anniversary on may from the beginning of our visit we had one shock after another first this week the cdc announced that everyone who s vaccinated can go mask free indoors or outdoors with mostly no restrictions however there are signs everywhere starting in the parking lot and throughout the parks that even if you are vaccinated for covid you must wear a mask at all times unless eating in designated eating zones and as an added touch they have mask police everywhere throughout the park and along the path from the parking lot to the parks to badger you to not only wear your mask but make sure you are wearing it properly even if there is not another person within of where you are walking so starting from when you exit the parking structure you are herded into another parking structure wherein your temperature is taken and you must pass through security i do not object to either of those procedures btw but then instead of a relatively short tram ride to the parks you now must walk about a mile on the path to the parks would have been nice to know that before we made the reservation given that my husband is a senior citizen and the walk was too long for him to go without a break and there is no place to sit down along the path to the parks mind you you pay for parking and then get to hike a solid mile before you get to the parks now prior to the visit i went on the app to try to figure out where we would be eating there was no where to make a reservation even in downtown disney it took me a couple of hours to figure out the only way you can buy food or drink throughout most of the park is by ordering through the app and then picking it up at a selected time and by the way not all of the restaurants are open the food available on this visit was extremely limited at every location couldn t find a salad or light protein anywhere carb city very disappointing only good aspect is in california adventures you can buy alcohol and trust me you will need it you can t even nibble on an ice cream cone or a pretzel while strolling through the park which is one of the most fun things to do at the parks buy yourself a snack to enjoy while waiting in a long line and btw another shock weren t these parks supposed to be at significantly reduced capacity nope it took us almost an hour in line at the front gate to even get into the park there were so many people minute waits at at least rides it seemed that families with young children were enjoying the park regardless of the restrictions but we were so miserable after arriving at a m we left at p m by this point i was so done with being a vaccinated person wearing a mask i had the temerity to take off my mask on the mile long walk back to the parking structure at that time of day there were very few people on the path going in either direction but nevertheless one of the mask police ordered me to put my mask back on he said this is private property to which i responded i m leaving so i m throwing myself out bye bye california disneyland needs to take a tip from florida disneyworld get rid of the mask mandate those folks who aren t vaccinated or who are scared can wear a mask but we will never persuade folks to get vaccinated if they believe they still have to wear a mask and follow all kinds of crazy restrictions the vaccines are effective in protecting us from covid and even variants wake up disneyland and follow the science i will not be returning to disneyland unless and until things get back to normal ,2,2021-05-16
169,Customer service,ryan in california adventure next to monsters inc ride was the most disrespectful employee at disney we have ever met ask us to get up from a seat and never asked anyone else to leave after watching him for mins and had over other family s siting around us threaten to call security just because i asked him why we were asked to move and the only party he asked to move with other groups around us ,2,2021-05-08
170,"May 2021 Visit, Masks with Young Kids and Food Frustrations",the park itself is excellent this is post more about covid changes reduced capacity at parks a social distancing a reduced hours and no magic morning stunk mask enforcement with elementary school age kids ugh maybe chill out with the mask over the nose please princess stuff i get it if adults aren t taking things seriously or if a kid just isn t wearing one but if a young child has the mask on and it s covering their mouth but has slid down past their nose a little does that really need a call out every time food water availability was also a negative the majority of those stands and carts that have fresh fruit pickles and drinks on ice weren t open the majority of food required mobile ordering just the ability to walk up and purchase wasn t good and then because of mask rules you couldn t walk around and sip on water or snack on a pretzel so that was also a pain we had a good trip overall honestly though it will be hard to pull the trigger on disneyland again until mask rules are eased ,5,2021-05-08
171,First weekend parks were open after being closed for covid-19.,really happy to go back especially since capacity was at less people is always a plus very welcoming cast members greeted everyone going through main street with smiles and waves masks mandatory lots of hand sanitizer stations also had washing stations download the disneyland app online food orders only lots of designated seats for eating need to do app reservations for star wars rise ride lines for photos and stores had an awesome time with the fam it will be an experience we never forget thanks disneyland and cast members for making it great ,5,2021-05-03
172,hurt mondos feelings :(,went to disney and went to the miraculous section was told by a nimwit employee that if my good friend and best friends lover mondo were to approach the actor playing marinette dupain cheng aka ladybug and tell her her good friend chat noir is actually adrien agreste we would receive free complementary macarons mondo excitedly ran to ladybug anticipating the sweet macarons fresh from the dupain bakery upon greeting ladybug he was faced with nothing but disappointment and sorrow mondo sulked back to us informing us we had been pranked unless you want to be abused by rude jokester employees do not go to disneyland mondo cried for the rest of the trip i pray no other family has to experience the same trauma our dear mondo has had to ,1,2021-04-26

174,Belated disappointments,this is a review about several visits pre pandemic my family had annual passes because that was the only thing that made sense for us financially i grew up going to disneyland once three times a year as we lived a few hours away the economy was much better during my youth but the prices for disney seemed to be justified more as well i don t understand paying per ticket for one day of disneyland let alone for a family of three with parking and more for refreshments etc quality was sinking faster than hassium through a hydrogen cloud food there is not only expensive but most of it is not good less than a decade ago they would replace your popcorn if it fell etc now a cup of scalding hot black coffee they told us to go across the park to pay for ice is the hot dogs are usually cold and closer to the texture of jerky you pay about times what you could pay for same quality or better out of the park preferable to spend more and get hospital cafeteria quality food at a restaurant if you have the time to spend waiting in a horrendous line even if you order on the app if you don t have to argue every other order because the staff can t keep up even when you get only meals there was one dessert that seemed worth it in the park taking into account the mark up for convenience the quality of service is sad i feel bad for the employees they don t get paid what they should considering how much people pay to enter and on merchandise and parking etc but they used to be expected to behave in a decent manner now one employee in guest relations will contradict what another says about guidelines and rules until you get out the information yourself on disney s website to convince them that they are wrong that s usually after another minute wait to have talked with them in the first place walking past you employees randomly glare or if you ask a cast member where a bathroom is many times they won t answer you don t know this is not disneyland pay out the nose standards people who work at walmart seem to statistically have better attitudes the grounds are supposed to be maintained top notch there are docuseries about it as customers guests we are told this is why we pay so much etc but there is trash scattered about regularly the tables and rides are dirty the bathrooms are anywhere from acceptable to horrendous i get that it s an amusement park and with the high traffic it s expected they have rodents etc but i had never seen roaches there until one of the few last times we went in november and january many of the bathrooms don t have working locks hooks etc the tiles and other pieces falling off missing and not enough toilet paper soap etc i m glad they have paper towels but unfortunately they do run out a lot and can t possibly control how wasteful people are they should have updated the restrooms a long time ago and could stand to add at least one more they added galaxy s edge and only one restroom galaxy s edge is ok i can t definitively take a stand because i m so mixed the interactions shows and food is the best in all of disneyland though again tiny portions for lots of money we tried to get into the cantina times and never had the chance did make light sabers which was very fun not sure worth the price couldn t throw in one extra light crystal per saber spent too much on an interactive pet that really isn t worth it looking back the atmosphere is cool but stagnant i was disappointed that so far there is not hoth area endor naboo etc the ride is pretty fun but not a favorite even though one of our family is a star wars super fan the area in all is well spread out but has some random bottle necked areas that don t make sense the d theatre sounds like a lame feature imo they could do much much better i have no doubt doesn t seem very creative nor as immersive as it could be guest relations takes too long to visit we easily spent hours working with cast members for a disabled party member even when we already had a disability pass no explanation why some rides would randomly switch to making us wait in the main line vs in the disability line you have to get lucky for it to work how the website says it is supposed to rides break all the time still i get that some are from the s but that s why it s expensive to maintain that stuff stuff happens gets old when you realize how often for the time and money spent severely disabled niece was trapped on a ride for minutes at the end of a taxing day we literally were on the ground in a spot where it was safe to step off and we had to once they said it was ok they undid the safety latches yet we had to stay seated for some reason all the child wanted was to stand up we were given attitude even though we complied with their unreasonable demands after the minutes we were marched off the ride to be given a pass after waiting for minutes to splash mountain in the evening which they seem to love to do in the past we had been told they lessen the water flow on the ride at night especially when it is cold as it was we were soaked i can t help but wear the tin foil hat for this earlier in the day we barely got wet in the same position as before and then we had to get off the ride in the evening and spend on warm dry clothing that we did not even like basic sweater sweats and socks for people husband refused to pay for self to be warm those clothes were washed twice following directions and started to fall apart we had to change in a dirty smelly bathroom that had no tp after waiting minutes for an open stall paying for parking is an insult to passholders and really to most people it used to be an optional convenience but for a while in anaheim there is literally no place within many miles of disney that offers parking most of the shuttles they used to have in the area aren t running anymore or ones that were free with parking are extra and are far away paying for parking you usually are told to park really far from the tram once you get to the tram it s a discombobulated mess many times the workers running the tram are not motivated you can tell they hate their jobs and will purposely milk their time doing anything regularly we had to account for sitting on the tram fully loaded and ready to go for minutes plus the waiting for it to show plus the ride etc people regularly don t follow rules on the tram people argue and even get into fights because there is no system adults will step on kids and push and fight to get on the tram to not have to wait at the end of the long day adding the politicized agenda to the parks is just going to make tensions worse it s all result of build up of paying so much to be disappointed and the mismanagement of crowds etc i don t know many times we were randomly hurdled into passageways that smelled of sewage after parades and shows that used to be strictly not allowed because it would destroy the magic i actually liked it overall because we had no kiddo with us that time and i was able to see behind the scenes also more grumpy cast members a few rats and more roaches etc lol because the security seems too low and cast members and all underpaid many guests are allowed to act despicably meanwhile we brought our niece whom is disabled and were approached by security several times because she literally was pushed to the ground by other guests and couldn t calm down or the ride we promised would be open by the third day we stayed in a row that time would finally be open then broke down for minutes we get approached but the people threatening to fight people the people stepping on our niece the kids running unsupervised hitting each other that s all ok because they are not as easy to deal with as harassing someone with disabilities and their family if you re going to eat it s better to go to dtd although you re risking spending that much more time in lines as well and won t get a park discount but most the food we had outside the park actually tasted like food massive complaints but we did have good memories we made lots of nostalgia for me on less crowded days it was a dream but seems like the changes being made for re opening are going to keep increasing the problems at least for families that don t have a combined income greater than k the magic that walt wanted has been fading and as a business disney can surely pander to wealthy fans vs giving the majority of people a chance to experience it i think that s the way it s headed people on welfare and the wealthy can share the park while the middle class moves on what it cost pre pandemic was barely worth it hoping they would finally use the funding to improve the park not just add more while neglecting the rest the new attractions ideas might look good like gold paint on a smelly stool ,2,2021-02-08

176,The Mack Daddy,the one and only the original theme park disneyland it s pricey in a little campy but it s one of those things you have to say you ve done once in your life and i m not talking about the fake one over in orlando i m talking about the real thing down in anaheim i don t care how old you are it will take you back to your childhood and that s the whole point i think and if you have children this is definitely i m about to do but be prepared to pay an arm and a leg to do it,5,2020-12-17
177,Awesome place!,everyone knows how amazing disney is it is an all day affair and more the different lands are creative and fun with rides around each theme it is the cleanest amusement park even when there are a lot of people ,5,2020-12-02
178,Bad experience atDisneyland,talked with disney person named sonia who was very rude and then hung up on me i think disneyland is hiring people who don t get what it is about been an annual pass holder for years but won t renew way too crowed the last few years and many cast members are rude walt would be very upset ,1,2020-11-13
179,Becoming way too overpriced,i ve been here almost every year of my life multiple times per year i know the parks like the back of my hand i love it here i will be going to disneyland as long as i m alive if i can still afford to the prices are becoming so outrageous that it makes it much harder to just get up and go you actually have to save for these trips and do more financial planning which means less trips it is like being in a different world while inside the parks and an experience everyone should get to have ,4,2020-10-29
180,We had an amazing time.,you guys should go here it is awesome their are cool things to buy and eat also the best ride is space mountain ,5,2020-10-20
181,THE DISNEYLAND GURU,i love this place i am the true disneyland guru ask me anything i live in australia and i have been to disneyland like one thlusand times its that good ,5,2020-09-01
182,Be prepared for reservations,be prepared to have to make reservations to get into a store it is a complete joke security was very rude i will stick with disney world and florida ,1,2020-08-15
183,Believe in the magic of Christmas,i ve been to disneyland anaheim alot of times but christmas is truly the most wonderful time of the year to visit the decoration lighting special parade made me believe in the magic of christmas we went on thursday dec th right before holiday season starts the park was not too crowded when we get there early in the morning we purposefully got up early and went before the park opened for the rope drop we felt like we made the right choice combined with max pass we were able to enjoy most of the rides with little to no queie before the noon crowds started coming in at noon we have finished most of the rides we wanted to try we went back to out hotel which is a short minutes walk from the park took a nap and had lunch went back in the afternoon the park was considerably more crowded by then but because of maxpass we were able to fully utilize our time for the remaining rides and shows definitely a time saver the highlight of the trip was indeed the christmas parade and it s a small world ride ,5,2020-08-14
184,I LOVE DISNEY,i love disney i have been going since i was and will be going till i m i will never get sick of it and there are some bad reviews about the long lines but it is a theme park and it is really worth the memories you will make with your family these are the memories you will bring up for years my family still bring up funny stories from up to years ago ,5,2020-08-09
185,A quick Pirates math equation,a simple equation for you fans out there regarding the pirates of the caribbean boat ride anaheim florida by quite a bit but shanghai all other versions of pirates that said disneyland is still so amazing in many ways and is well worth your time ,5,2020-08-08
186,wrong theme park classifications,there is only one problem tripadvisor disneyland magic kingdom and all other disney parks and resorts are not classified as amusement parks they are theme parks so this list is incorrect based on that ,5,2020-08-03
187,This Happy Place!,the original and best we completed a hour day in disneyland and still wanted more splash mountain was our favourite the attractions the atmosphere and the food quality in every sense of the word there s nowhere like it ,5,2020-07-31
188,Wow fantastic Disneyland,we had a tremendous time at disneyland and personally i preferred it than orlando certainly not as big crowds everything seemed more relaxed and enjoyable i spoke with some of the staff on the way round and they loved working there and had done so for years we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and well played management and staff keep up the good work till next time ,5,2020-07-29
189,Small but perfect!,we are a disney mad family and i had been here before i had the children and was so glad i got to go with them it is much smaller than florida but we were visiting on a small road trip and it did not disappoint if you are a disney fan you need to visit if you are in this part of the usa ,5,2020-07-15
190,AMAZINGGG,the most happiest place on earth dontwriteabadrevieworthemousewillgetyou i actually love disneyland magical and amazing ,5,2020-06-06
191,Crowded to point of not worth it,compared to orlando this is rd half the size and seems double the people road there was awful and slow much most of la freeways the star wars was the highlight and rest was so so problem was too many people and we went on a not crowded day not worth the money go to orlando instead ,3,2020-05-29
192,Magical,best theme park in the world but sometimes the line takes too long i would definitely come back every year,4,2020-05-03
193,The most magical place on Earth!,most magical place on earth we went over the easter holidays so it was super busy we spent days in this park alone and it wasn t long enough to do all the things we wanted we made the mistake of travelling each day from la hollywood boulevard it is far too far to travel next time we will stay in a local hotel if you want to get the most out of the day i would suggest some planning but you can still have a good time just going with the flow if there is little you are desperate to see ,5,2020-04-30
194,Never gets old !,doesn t matter how many i come here it still feels like home love the rides old and new star wars was wonderfully done and a nice addition to disney ,5,2020-04-22
195,Classic Attractions,we ve been to several disney parks around the globe and there is something special about disneyland our favorite is the haunted mansion holiday if you are a nightmare before christmas fan you just have to visit at halloween ,5,2020-04-12
196,Awesome,i am a big fan of disney world and was therefore slightly worried that the original would underwhelm however there were enough differences between traditional rides at both parks to make it special and some unique things that you won t find anywhere else we were lucky that it wasn t too busy on any of the days that we visited during august and would recommend this for travellers from the uk as a lot of local schools reopen from mid august onwards ,5,2020-04-12
197,Disappointed!,i give stars and yet entitle my review disappointed because my visit was so full of contradictions so many contradictions because throughout the entire experience the staff were impeccable truly amazing never letting the brand down for a second and i m not talking about face characters i m talking about staff manning queues i m talking about staff selling merchandise i m talking about staff selling experiences they were without exception faultless i salute you the delivery of the experience is amazing every zone is immaculate and expertly delivered it was a thoroughly professional performance and yet i was disappointed why because there were so many elements to my experience that were not included some excluded by virtue of building works but some it would appear due to lack of numbers in the park no inclusion we witnessed approx face characters throughout the park compared to what was promised i consider the offering to be poor i have attached photos with my review they are the elements that we did not experience we paid premium for our tickets but yet so many events get cancelled or not included and no one gets informed i could not believe when i looked back on our experience and the things that were promised to us how little we actually saw there is so much to see in this park if you don t want to queue for hours for something the whole idea as i saw it was that there things to keep you amused that you could plan to see to fill up your day lots of these elements were cancelled or just didn t take place the professionalism of this park is second to none but that doesn t mean they can charge premium prices for less the the full experience ,5,2020-04-08
198,Nice to return,was nice to return to disneyland and our first time without kids there was a lot of changes to the park since our last visit including the new star wars galaxy s edge area was nice to also ride the classics like peter pan jungle cruise and the disneyland railroad the park is clean as every very friendly cast members as always ,5,2020-04-07
199,Happies place on Earth?,if you have never been you must go with that said realize it is a commercial endeavor and can get pricey take your family i was yo when i first went ,5,2020-03-31
200,First Time to Disneyland - Different to Disney World but the same...,we approached our recent visit to disneyland with a bit of trepidation to be honest having visited disneyworld in orlando a couple of times over the last few years would it match up yes it s smaller which means you are able to get around it on foot we had a park hopper allowing us to visit california adventurepark as well which was good of course it s the usual money extracting with a smile operation but somehow you sort of don t notice really the staff aren t quite the same level of enthusiasm as orlando though as other reviewers have noted on here but that said they were very helpful when i we needed them it is a pity they don t have the same fastpass systems and magicband stuff as in orlando i think it would streamline some processes but hey ho obviously right now the park is closed demand for rise of the resistance in galaxy s edge is high and will be again which means you have to be in the park at when the virtual queue system opens and you can register on the app all of your party must be in the park together which can mean an early start the experience is worth it though so yes it s disney it s the same but different the staff aren t quite as on it as they are in orlando but still miles ahead of universal orlando in my opinion ,4,2020-03-31
201,Family Vacation,i visited the park when i was a child around years old they have added so much it is absolutely amazing we took our kids for thier first time we spent days in the park and could have spent a few more just to get to those rides we liked or never got to go to there is just so much to do it s almost overwhelming if you have the time and money do one of the character breakfasts it was really fun and the kids loved seeing all the characters wear comfortable shoes cause your gonna do a lot of walking recommend taking refillable bottles there are stations everywhere also if your budget allows get the photo pass it is so work the money we will be going back again soon,5,2020-03-17
202,COVID-19 Day of Closure Prevention,i flew down to disneyland for the historic unprecedented closure after a delayed flight and some drama with uber i arrived at the original disney park wow i m sure glad i did too oh boy the panic and uncertainty of the world melted away as soon as i scanned my bicoastal pass the disney magic was alive and well i m sure walt is looking down from heaven happy knowing he created a respite from an speculative world the masks worn by park guests were few and far between i saw maybe in the hours i celebrated life the disney experience allowed me to turn away from the fear of sickness toilet paper hoarders and the constant bombardment of last days style doom and gloom the weather didn t allow for the fireworks but that did not diminish the evening festivities please see my pics the somberness of the historic day really hit home when from about pm to midnight many cast members stood with the princesses and characters to wave good bye as park guests walked out leaving that branded disney magic returning to the uncertainty and unknown i received an email from disney parks regarding my annual pass it will be extended for the length of time of the shutdown i also read cast members will be paid during the shutdown i m proud to financially support an entity like disney despite their massive financial loss they are taking care of us all well done ,5,2020-03-17
203,Wonderful happy place,we had an absolute ball in disneyland with our extended family and two grandchildren one who has a disability so we were able to use a das pass without it we would not have been able to do half of what we did the weather was glorious not sure if that meant more people but boy it was busy the queues in a morning were huge on one day they went from the disneyland gates to disney california that s when they opened the gates the ride of the resistance is awesome our savvy group managed to get passes on all three days you do need to do your homework first on how to use the app i can t say much else about disneyland it s an amazing place i do hope one day we will go back when we were there the coronavirus was active in australia but not in the usa i did predict that when disneyland closed the locals will realize how dire the situation is take care mickey minnie and all your wonderful friends ,5,2020-03-16
204,Not the best experience,the employee was quite rude to me i went single rider and i accidentally threw away the single rider ticket then the employee told me get it out of the recycling right now and so i tried and told her i couldn t then i walked away the she called me a brat behind my back and ruined my day ,3,2020-03-14
205,Extremely disappointed!,my family and i visit annually and drive hrs in order to do so march th was a rainy day which we planned for but the wait to get into the park theough security was absurd i appreciate the safety measures but you have to design the entrance to keep things moving smoothly sitting in the rain with toddlers is not enjoyable if we are going to commit to you park in the rain try and make your guests comfortable get more lanes or a better system also so many rides were down there should be a voucher for another day if a certain amount of rides arent running or if the entire day is rainy ,2,2020-03-14
206,Double the birthdays double the fun,celebrated our daughters st birthday and our sons th birthday at the happiest place on earth during the corona virus apocalypse it was very clean we felt safe and the longest wait was min which is unheard of for a saturday galaxy edge star wars land was our favorite it s like transporting yourself into the star wars movies we had a blast so glad we didn t chicken out and had the best time ,5,2020-03-14
207,An 'OK' Visit,we are disney people you know the kind we sing its praises and look forward to each and every visit we see the movies and know the characters we raised our kids to be disney people too and they also love it as adults we even planned our fairytale wedding at disneyland and it is still talked about today even after nearly years so yes we are disney people for us disneyland is our happy place despite the crowds and the cost it had always been worth it for us our most recent visit was this past february and we crammed in both the california adventure park and disneyland in two days which was not enough time if we were to have done it over again we would have skipped the california adventure park in favor of both days in disneyland so did we see everything we wanted to see not this time realistic timelines are important and we underestimated our time needs that said we rode all of the major attractions that we wanted to including the smugglers run in the new galaxy s edge land i am not a big star wars fan but there are some interesting things to see in that land for us it is a one done experience there is not enough to do there because the likelihood of the average disney guest having a chance to ride the rise of the resistance or experience the cantina is nil it is really disappointing the haunted mansion was down but we knew that going in as disneyland does post what attractions will be down for refurbishment we used fast pass for indiana jones and waited in the standby lines for everything else the average line time was around minutes which really isn t that bad we have waited longer many a time we did not use max pass as the park tickets are expensive enough and we really didn t need any of the features offered with the add on we have plenty of pictures of the park already and don t mind waiting for our favorite attractions even when our kids were young we were able to wait in the lines without them balking too much the wait was usually worth it for them the cast members are usually very kind and helpful but there was a propensity among some of the cast members to stand and talk amongst themselves rather than be of assistance to park guests this was not the norm but it was aggravating none the less also a bit aggravating was that some of the restaurants that were formerly first come first served are now reservation only the app we were using did not mention that so we had to approach restaurants to find a spot to have dinner in the park but again this was not the end of the world and there were other options that worked be advised however that the restaurants are fair at best and very expensive if you have time it is worth it to leave the park at mealtimes and enjoy some of the local restaurants that are much less expensive and far better quality the ice cream shop in disneyland is amazing though and worth every penny the biggest disappointment of this particular visit was the fireworks show or lack thereof we would have never stood there and waited if we knew how lackluster and uninspiring it would be we had become accustomed to big impressive fireworks not the very short display at the beginning of the show projection mapping on the buildings along main street is not the same as spectacular fireworks and simply not worth the wait the music sounded like a poor plug for disney kids tv and the choreographed projection mapping was pretty bad certainly not up to the standards that were previously set and not anything special we were really underwhelmed and disappointed in this display and no parade that was a first in all the years we have been going what was up with that we didn t run into any of the rides being down other than the planned refurbishment of the haunted mansion and king arthur s carousel and enjoyed all of the attractions we did want to go on i don t think however that cast members are trained the way they used to be they weren t very helpful and seemed bothered by the guests they are paid to take care of this was a new experience for us as we had never questioned the costs because it was always worth it not so much this time the magic was lacking and we will probably spend our vacation dollars elsewhere for a couple of years and try again in hopes that the park resumes it s formerly magical experience ,3,2020-03-13
208,"Wrestled Mickey/Goofy to a draw, but it wasn't easy",just back from sunday bday visit of us with our daughter who is student usc even with locals giving us with great intel on how to stretch your money time at the park we spent hours miles in dland calif adventure it took days for us to recover and my ae cc is still in intensive care with the outrageous cost of one day two park hopper passes plus maxpass we were already in the hole before in the park did i mention that disney requires you to set up a online acct in order to buy tickets something was wrong with our accts it wouldn t allow us to buy tix and after hrs on the phone with some of the rudest cast members especially caroline we were finally able to give mickey our money but had to pick up the tix at will call hrs no joking okay once at the park hit the will call got the tix entered the park registered all tix to member accts and guess what all boarding groups to r of the rest given out for the day back up as well so lets get this right if the ride slots are gone by the time the park opens to general public that means the slots are going to vip guests and those spending thousands at the on site properties who get into park an hour before general public so democracy at disney has gone to the gurus of greed so if you vacay holiday there the key is staying on property and hope and pray you bring enough money and flash the cash at hotel cast members to get you priority on the most popular rides so for the rest of us get the max pass and pray for rain or go wed thursday slowest days now since the tix prices have gotten so high there are less out of state tourist and more socal visitors who get annual passes and do half day quarterly trips when then can so instead of standing in line with fun folks from other lands or states enjoy being crammed into one hr lines with locals trying desperately to get their money s worth from the mouse the mill falcon ride was underwhelming you are boarded in groups of make sure you request what position you want on the ride they hand you plastic position cards before you board we didnt figure it out till we boarded the ride so had young pup pilot think it was funny to crash the ride into walls and ceilings making other pax guests sick and want off ride fun couldn t get into the cantina did do the light saber challange check in was one of the most disorganized with cast members standing around not sure what to do we had to speak with at least three diff members in order to cough up the cash the kids enjoyed the exp and they get a light saber for their effort some memories made but rough start by poorly trained staff who didnt stay in character did magic space mountin on fast pass and then migrated from dland to cali adventure for lunch flo s cafe of burger fries and drinks cali had differnt vib and feel than dland and is usually less packed and easier to move around and get on rides but not for us it was the wine food festival so park was more packed than disneyland helpful hints bring your own snacks water but if you buy anything expect insane prices they will give you free water at most eateries so ask the park restrooms were pretty clean with cleaning crews everwhere even before corona rides get max pass and let the kids set it up it can be challange to use for us older folks but the kids can make it work to get you on rides without the one hour waits speaking of rides at least four broke down over two parks over three hours not very impressive for the happiest place on earth had some great characters interactions chewy photobombed our our pic at galaxy s edge had nice brief tea with mad hatter darth was routine asked a cast member for photo with capt hook who was rude but finally had great time with spiderman now cast members from the extremely rude ones on the phone at tix office to the three cast members milling around galaxy s edge complaining bout working hours conditions pay alot of cast members out of character and out of sorts not sure walt would be happy so in my plus years visting land twice and world times cast members this time ranged from nice to useless never seen cast members stand around in groups and ignore guests as we saw in galaxy s edge hope during the corona closing maybe time for a break and thank you for hard work under trying times in hospitality industry and alot of retraining to the disney standard of customer service by the way for those keeping track thats almost for four for two parks with hopper maxpass parking food light saber experience hardly the weekend get away for a family with kids that walt envisioned you will not be judged at the park by the content of your character or the nobility of your quest but how much cheddar you are willing to give to the mouse its really sad and nothing happy about it ,4,2020-03-13
209,Early Bird,get up early get through security get in that long line to get in get your boarding group celebrate and cheer with the crowd when you get one and then enjoy the rest of your day in the park it s all worth it ,5,2020-03-12
210,Awesome Experience!,disneyland never fails the best theme park for us my favorite is star wars galaxy s edge fantasmic has more lightning effects than before ,5,2020-03-11
211,Spring Break 2020,had a great time three days was exactly the right amount of time to do all we wanted to do highly recommend ,5,2020-03-11
212,A great afternoon with friends,six of us had lunch then toured the park we walked the restaurant and shops prior to entering the park we rode the train around the various attractions then returned to our hotel by monorail just a perfect afternoon with friends and super weather next visit is with our grandkids,5,2020-03-11
213,An experience,it s an experience but honestly who will wait hour in line for each attraction better to just walk around and eat had the best ceasar salad of my life here ,4,2020-03-11
214,"Cool place to visit, just too many people!",we got though the park entrance by am and proceeded to get our boarding pass for the star wars ride and got group in other words come back tomorrow around am so crazy we re going to have to wait a few years when the craziness is over the millennium falcon ride was a minute wait not bad just don t eat right before you might toss your cookies we re at the park on a wednesday its only am snd it s crazy packed i thought spring break was in april this is a beautiful and clean park just don t plan on getting to every ride and be ready to rub elbows as you walk through i hope this helps,4,2020-03-11
215,Fireworks!,who doesn t love disney i know i sure do the magic the entertainment the rides and oh lets not forget about the churros i had a blast and i am sure you will do ,5,2020-03-10
216,My Happy Place,as always a perfect day wait times were minimal make sure you see the lincoln show everyone should visit the show and learn about our history if you know the history this is a good refresher very moving presentation ,5,2020-03-10
217,"Not so magical with 16 year olds, but still a great time!",get ready for crowds and long lines for the rides and attractions it was worth it to get the max pass but there s a bit of a learning curve to use it with your smart phone you have to use the disney app and the availability is limited but we got to ride on about more rides than we would have if we had to use the standby lines for those without access to the pass we only had days for the park so the day pass for disneyland resort was just right if we had more time we would have enjoyed getting to the california adventure side of the park we ll have to do that next time for sure as it was we didn t get to experience the rise of the resistance you have to be in the park right when it opens and book it at rope drop it fills up in less than seconds for the day we couldn t even get in the park on time as the line was out to the bus drop off by the time we got there other than that we did everything else that we wanted to and visited each of the lands lots of shopping everywhere and plenty of food choices but prices are very high as you can expect otherwise the rest of the experience is paid for by the tickets make sure that you manage to come back to or stay in the park for the evening there are many shows and events that are after dark and very worth hanging around for plus the lines for the rides get much shorter so waits are minimal and be prepared to put in about or miles of walking per my fit bit each day lots of wheel chairs for those with mobility issues and many many stollers are utilized by young and old my year old twin girls had a great time spent some time off by themselves doing what they wanted even though they weren t interested in the characters that were there or felt much of the magic they ve already asked when we can go back and do the california side so i count it as a success and the memories will last a lifetime ,4,2020-03-09
218,First timers at house of mouse,well what to say at age i finally managed to make it to the house of mouse certainly some things lived up to the hype while others were a bit meh as star wars tragics first stop was galaxys edge the line for the millennium falcon ride was hours it was an amazing ride though the disappointing part was that the rise of the resistance ride was already booked out for the next two days so i would suggest if you want to do this ride book in advance as it turns out the ride was faulty the day we were there anyway the other small issue was that we wanted to get a photo with the stormtroopers however they completely brushed past us and wouldn t stop we being adults however later with my nephew they were quite amenable adults deserve some fun too the other rides were pretty fun indiana jones pirates of the caribbean and star tours what surprised me was the lack of characters walking around as you see in all the promotional material we only saw stormtroopers during the day in the evening we did see chewbacca and at the very end mickey mouse and pluto i was also surprised by the lack of disney princess paraphernalia also if you want to eat in the park itself as opposed to disney downtown you also need to book early ie a couple of days before i would also suggest getting the disney app as it gives realistic wait times for the rides and so you can be strategic about using fast passes you can only have one fast pass every hours the fireworks and light display in the evening were indeed spectacular all in all though a fun experience even for us oldies ,4,2020-03-08
219,Ultimate Family/Friend Fun,fantastic family trip for all ages the fast pass helps with time management and allows you to explore and head towards your preferred ride without guessing we will be back for sure days is ideal to get the full experience ,5,2020-03-08
220,Food & Wine Festival,we went to the park during covid scare and it slightly caused smaller lines we were able to get a boarding group for starwars rise of the resistance which if you don t get one when the park opens they are gone in seconds the rides are nice and the park is kept very clean prices for food and souvenirs is outrageous so beware ,5,2020-03-08
221,"Fun, crowded and expensive",first visit to dl love wdw i paid for the max pass with the free photos i did find it hard to find the professional photographers as compared to wdw i felt a little let down also with wdw the rides have cool videos with you on the ride not here i did get on the rise of the resistance after a hour wait but it was worth it food sooo expensive to park staff were very nice love disney but sadly prefer wdw ,4,2020-03-07
222,WDW is better,so cozy but still crowded in mid february we got to pilot the millenium falcon d yay did not manage to get a boarding group for rise of the resistance but we had a blast anyway will be back ,3,2020-03-06
223,Perfect,disneyland used to have a down season but not any more and the crowds and rented motorized scooters wagon s for children and triple wide baby strollers are making it more and more challenging people who need scooters and wheel chairs need to have them and baby s need those strollers it is some of the oversized rentals i am talking about most of the cast is still fantastic rides are top notch and will always be a fan ,5,2020-03-06
224,I am a big fan of Disneyland but the crowds are really bad,really recomend to go on weekdays and purchase max pass so you can get fast track on your phone also set up alarm on your phone so you can select the new fast track as soon as it is available,4,2020-03-05
225,Park Hopper with Max Pass,it never gets old this time it was just the wife and i and we had the ticket that let us get fast track online so no walking back and forth it was worth it ,5,2020-03-05
226,Back again!,visited disneyland and california adventure it was really disappointing to see the amount of rides temporarily closed people pay a lot of money for there to be so many rides closed between the two parks there was at least four rides closed for whatever reason if disney is going to have the extreme priced tickets they least they can do is have up time on rides glad this wasn t any of our clients ,5,2020-03-05
227,Rides Closed,a dream vacation included disney allow enough time as the lines are long be sure to take advantage of the quick pass option as this really helps the most amazing ride is the new star wars totally interactive and real the food is expensive so we brought in a picnic lunch it was a nice experience ,3,2020-03-05
228,A dream come trye,this is the th time here and the only time we ve all commented on the garbage cans overflowing and odd sewage like smells all over the park normally this place is immaculate and that s why we come back also normally the cast members are over the top friendly most were this time but a few were having some bad days i guess over the days we were there this is the only time i ve felt a little disappointed here sadly ,4,2020-03-04
229,Rude Employees,currently visiting disneyland for the very first time with my partner and year old daughter i was quite surprised by our visit as most people we spent a pretty penny for this trip and the employees were very rude when planning this trip i expected overly friendly staff but did not get this every ride we went on the employees were bothered by everyone getting on the ride as if we are wasting their time more specifically waited for the new star wars ride all day to finally board and it was broke down when inquiring information i watched one of the employees female can t remember her name started talking about all of the guest loud enough for us all to hear this is ridiculous and unacceptable she was upset that she had to tell guests more than once we were sitting in the beginning of the area where they had a drink station set up and was told to move asked why and didn t get an answer looking around seeing other guests standing around i am very disappointed in this visit and will not be spending this type of money to come back ,1,2020-03-03
230,Cambria hotel & suites,once again management team shout out to caira mark derek made us feel right at home once again seriously we will not be looking to stay anywhere else we dont mind the minute walk the art buses take just as long to get to the stop in front of hotel and great exercise with two double strollers despite the jacuzzi being out of order ooo my kids still enjoyed the degree pool even on the overcast day days last saturday sunday brad even replied back to our review from our last stay late january early february of this year thanks send me your email please planning on returning again for a week this summer when kids are on summer break our home away from home bay area the kids loved their pool view see photos,5,2020-03-03
231,Worst Customer Service Experience Ever!,unfortunately because of the corona virus my plans to go to a business conference was cancelled i had initially purchased a ticket to disneyland for one night while i was there i was simply asking for a disney gift card if they couldn t give me a refund since i live on the east coast and wouldn t make it back they were so rude in saying no worst customer service ever i thought they were supposed to be customer oriented something definitely changed and this park is all about greed and the bottom dollar i will never support disney again after this experience and i mean everything disney ,1,2020-03-03
232,Happiest Place on Earth!! FOR SURE!!,traveled to the park for our anniversary spent two days the new star wars ride is amazing we are not big star wars fans what a great attraction enjoyed many of the classics always love the peter pan flight mr toads wild ride spent a little more time in the fantasy land area than we normally do really enjoyed the attractions and the atmosphere there took the walk in walt s footsteps tour really enjoyed that and got to go up to walt s apartment afterwards that was the highlight just a really great place to spend a few days saw a few characters and had pictures with mickey goofy the park was not overly crowded and we were able to ride all of the major attractions with little wait time ,5,2020-03-02
233,Always awesome!,normally i am not a fan of change to my favorite park but i must say that the new rides parade and changes are all very enjoyable and keep the park feeling fresh it s still one of my favorite destinations and with some pre planning is a wonderful vacation ,5,2020-03-01
234,Why are so many cast members so unhappy?,for what disneyland charges to walk through the gates not to mention what they charge for annual passes and parking the least the cast members can do is to be friendly and courteous at the happiest place on earth the only kind and friendly cast members we encountered on our recent visit were the piano player and at one of the shops in batuu everyone else from the guest services agent outside the gates to the disneyland photographers to the cast members working at the counter at the coca cola refreshment corner were all just plain rude unhappy unfriendly and very un disney while i m sure my review won t stop any of the people from visiting disneyland every day of the year let it be known that i have seen a huge shift for the worst in the attitudes of disney cast members and it really is a downer compared to even just a few years ago ,3,2020-03-01
235,Loved it!,my husband and i spent days here for president s day weekend in february we live on the east coast and have been to wdw several times this was our first visit to dl it was such a fun weekend we went to dl on friday around pm went to disney california adventure on saturday and back to dl on sunday this was the perfect amount of time for our visit we got tickets with max pass the extra cost was definitely worth it to be able to schedule fastpasses through the app free photopass was an added bonus we were so excited to get a boarding pass to rise of the resistance it was a very fun experience be patient and prepared for crowds it was very busy throughout the park when we visited ,5,2020-03-01
236,Star Wars,flew from nz and stopped off only as i wanted to do disneyland star wars land and do the two new rides star wars land cool but if you think you will be able to do rise of the resistance you will be very disappointed you can t buy fast passes you have to pay park entry even before you can go into the app and try book the ride it books out in minutes we were there at am with app open but difficult to navigate and at past it said booked out for the day u can t even queue for the ride when we complained staff said yes tricky to navigate app we weren t alone many people complaining very expensive day when the only thing you want to do is the new ride disneyland very disappointed,1,2020-03-01
237,A great day,took my y o son and his friend for the first time spending the first day at disneyland and the second day at california adventure i had not been in years so i spent a lot of time researching and planning because i knew nothing about fastpass or maxpass turns out that if you use those passes efficiently you can spend way less time in line and enjoy more rides the staff was very friendly and the park was incredibly clean not sure why that was so unexpected we went feb the th disneyland seemed pretty crowded based on what i expected for a midweek day in the off season but with the maxpass it worked well not a cheap vacation but in the end worth doing ,5,2020-02-29
238,Disneyland has lost its charm and magic,this was my family s fifth trip to disneyland and i have to say i was very disappointed disney used to be all about the guest experience and now it is clear that it is all about making as much money as possible cast members used to be friendly but now the focus is more on herding people through like cattle long lineups even the fast pass returns the process for trying to get on the new rise of the resistance ride is ridiculous and should be better advertised so people can make the decision before deciding to spend a lot of money to go here if they feel it is worth it when there is a good chance they won t get on the ride lineups for security and park entrance are long due to everyone trying to be in the park by to get a chance of obtaining a boarding pass for ror the park is crowded and full of people staring at their phones to keep track of their boarding pass status or fastpass rather than enjoying the park doesn t seem like this is what walt intended everything has become more expensive almost us for a bottle of water and quality of food is average rides like indiana jones and ror break down a lot leading to frustrated patrons the park used to have a charm which is now sorely lacking it used to be one of our favorite places to visit but it will be a long time before we think of going again ,3,2020-02-29
239,Fun for Everyone!,everytime i go i enjoy myself whether it be with my kids or on an adult bff trip the smells the sights and the rides i love every minute of it,5,2020-02-29
240,It is what it is,overpriced overrun with people but it is what it is fun place for kids and kids at heart price of entry and food is always very frustrating but they will continue to charge it if people keep coming in droves the positive is they try to manage the crowds and make it somewhat reasonable to ride what you like fastpass wait times etc also good to download other apps to see where lines and characters are worth a visit but maybe only every two or three years ,3,2020-02-29
241,Disneyland CA,been there seen it done it got the t shirt mickey ears the park is split across sites next to each other both costing a fee to enter even with a discount code you are looking at pp per day you will need at least a day to go round each park everything is way overpriced and strongly recommend taking your own snacks drinks the parks were clean tidy the staff were polite and friendly queue times were long averaging around minutes download the disney app will help with planning you visit queue show times public transport links to the park were good and frequent but you re likely to find most local resorts offer free shuttle service there is a regular priced mcdonalds opposite the park for breakfast so get yourself an early start ,3,2020-02-29
242,All folks Paradise,from small children to senior citizens enjoying themselves in disneyland park most rides are less scary and suitable for all ages ,5,2020-02-29
243,Extremely busy and the Max Pass really isn't worth it,this was the second time i ve been here and this time was extremely busy the new starwars ride was sold out the lineups were so long the food was expensive and the staff really aren t as friendly as i have heard they are supposed to be the max pass can definitely be re designed to be easier to use more intuitive and robust disney please feel free to contact me for ideas on how to enhance it there should be more communication about the new starwars ride selling out in less than two minutes every day when many people travel from afar they will be very disenchanted to know this is the case otherwise the park itself is amazing the staff really is mediocre both times i ve been there i didn t encounter anyone who showed the disney values which i have heard about unfortunately ,4,2020-02-28
244,Time with our daughter at age 18!,we love this place we are going to buy an annual pass we went on the showboat jungle cruise astro blaster manorail disneyland railroad and more we always live those disneyland ice pops with the mickey ears it s so much fun ,5,2020-02-28
245,Not the best Disneylsnd trip but still very good,been coming here since the early s as a toddler moved away to another state in the s but began taking annual trips here with my two children starting around years ago in that span of time it s been pretty consistent as far as quality crowds customer service etc not anymore this latest trip was a somber wake up call that disneyland has become officially ghetto in every sense where to start disney views its guests condescendingly we don t gjve them enough money they wish to extract much much from you ten dollar corn dogs check sodas check but here s the best part no refills for you not only is this a thing it s actually enforced my daughter grabbed us a soda from the fountain we had just paid for it it was not a refill a restaurant worker was placed beside the soda machine and confronted my yr old daughter asking her is that a refill because we don t allow refills my daughter said no and was a little shaken by the whole thing disney you are disgusting also we ate at rancho de zacalos which we always had before that like everything else here is not the same don t listen to reviews here that say portions are huge my two teen daughters and i thought maybe we could share two entrees and a bag of chips and guac we barely got enough to eat the cheese enchiladas have no cheese in them or on them the nachos are small for one person i saw nothing but empty plates everywhere they got very very stingy and greedy the disney greed has no bounds let s continue it doesn t end at the greed btw good luck if you have the disney rewards visa your promised dining discount literally only works at the french market and nowhere else more disney lies but we ve gotten the greed part down you all already know they simply can t extract enough money from everyone let s move onto the basics like facilities bathrooms this time were understocked with toilet paper my daughter had to use seat covers to wipe employees seemed overworked underpaid nervous exasperated and frankly this reflected in their demeanor towards guests who can really blame them unlike the much much better universal studios hollywood disneyland had several bathrooms that had no paper towels whereas universal utilizes hand dryers in all their very clean well stocked bathrooms disney has gone full ghetto disney thinks you re a potential thug and trains their employees to view you as such and it shows at universal the employees were an absolute delight who clearly loved their jobs and applauded us all as we came back from rides it was such a nice fun touch disney employees obviously are bitter and maybe they do deal with a lot of jerks but it s off putting to the rest of us to bear the brunt of their attitude universal is a much classier place and i m sure doesn t attract a lot of annual pass holders so it s mostly tourists and not locals who think they own the place regardless universal is infinitely more successfully managed and if you go on a lower attendance day you will absolutely get your money s worth the studio tour is fantastic i mean fantastic there is nothing in disneyland anymore that i can pin that adjective to galaxy s edge is impressive but there are only two rides there we got on rise of the resistance it s fun but personally i think overhyped it isn t something we were dying to do again customer service is at an all time low we had fast passes for big thunder mountain railroad we were almost to the boarding area when the ride broke down it was the th time that day i believe what did they do for us gave us replacement fast passes not good on space mountain star wars the matterhorn or indiana jones basically all you could use it on was splash mountain which we did i got completely soaked and spent hours trying to dry off in the sun before the sun set and it was degrees that day anyway we got shafted on that whole ordeal just another example of how disney doesn t really care you re easily replaced and the crowds never stop coming so next thanks disney i saved and scrimped so much to make this trip happen and this is how you treat us furthermore after splash mountain it was around and we went to space mountain and the return was for park closed at so for hours we held one fast past with no possibility for another fast pass times now are way ahead so you might be able to use in a day whereas we used to be able to use it just gets worse and worse here we were in the park for hours and never did get to ride all that we wanted to this was weds the th a supposed small crowd day according to the disney calendar as well as is it packed dot com it was packed if you ever are here when it s not count yourself extremely blessed but let s continue onto other points the indiana jones ride was always one of our favorites it is clearly not the same one section of the ride including the best part where the boulder drops was completed in total darkness and we felt totally gipped no audio no visuals the ride is in total disrepair and breaks down frequently as do most rides these days within the park if you enjoy feeling like cattle being herded if you enjoy being viewed as a potential thug or low life if you enjoy being bled dry financially if you enjoy mediocre food at fancy prices if you enjoy standing in long lines even on lower attendance days and very possibly the ride breaking down either before you make it on or while you re on it if you enjoy poorly maintained and stocked bathrooms poor customer service and compensation then by all means come here don t say i didn t warn you i ve been coming here since this is by far the worst i ve ever seen it my kids and i are done done we had a much better day at universal studios the attendance prediction websites were spot on with universal only they said disneyland would be quiet but it was packed universal had no waits for any rides it was clean and so cute and the studio tour was incredible employees were fantastic bathrooms very clean totally professionally run in every sense disneyland is no longer worth it my kids and i agree the magic is officially gone ,4,2020-02-28
246,Disneyland is officially Ghetto. RIP beloved land of my youth.,disneyland has been around for decades some of the rides are showing their age but technology is well used at the park the disney app is a great way to see how long the waits are whether fast pass is available and also the only way to currently queue for the newest rise of the resistance ride the california adventures park is very updated totally accessible and lots of fun if you do your research you will be able to take advantage of the extra hour that both parks offer at different times you could potentially do the park am to pm that s the best way to get the most out of your purchase as it is very expensive ,2,2020-02-28
247,Lives up to its reputation,i was so excited to go to disneyland i should have planned better we bought a one day park hopper but the parks were so busy we were only able to get on three rides the entire day it was awful never again ,4,2020-02-28
248,Disney! What else can I say.,so disneyland i ve been going there since a few years after it opened i love the place there s always something new to do and see the prices are trough the roof and everywhere you turn they are trying to sell you something or make your kids guilt you into something but still we go and we love it just bring all of your money ,5,2020-02-26
249,See the wonder of a child's view through adult eyes,my adult daughter and i got the day park hopper and it was just right the two parks have their own charm and a good variety of rides and experiences between them the new galaxy s edge land is visually stunning still some glitches on rise of the resistance we tried each day to get on it got a boarding pass each day but were able to experience it only once it went down for hours each day because we had days that ended up bring okay for us for others with not as much time it could be very disappointing it is a jaw dropping experience when it works the millenium falcon was lots of fun but that did vary with how much the cast members stayed in character the new to us guardians of the galaxy attraction was just a ridiculous amount of fun ,5,2020-02-25
250,I would live here if I could! I LOVE the place!,disneyland never disappoints unless it has a rainstorm which is rare it is so beautiful the attention to detail is amazing love the foliage the landscaping the artistry the rides are just so cool and every year they get better i do hate it when something is taken out tho miss the hollywood tower of terror the new star wars land is so amazing also like visiting a different planet love how it all changes through the seasons ,5,2020-02-25
251,Happiest Place on Earth,this was our rd visit and it s still just amazing disney is expensive but worth it so much entertainment for one day wait times for february are short and we still couldn t do it all in one day for disney and for california adventure minimum ,5,2020-02-24
252,Disneyland with a 4 year old,we thoroughly enjoyed the happiest place on the earth it was wonderful disney does a great job in hiring their princesses characters and even the food court staff everyone was so accomodating happy patient and helpful during our visit the time was very magical don t leave disneyland until you ve had at least dole pineapple whip ,5,2020-02-24
253,"Six Flags atmosphere, Disney prices",this review is my subjective opinion i was very disappointed with our fall vacation to disneyland it s been a few years since we ve been and it s really changed for the worse in my opinion large groups of people or more people were constantly cutting in line this happened at least times a day and if you said anything you risked being attacked physically or verbally the majority of the cast members acted like they could really care less the ones who were still disney nice were in the minority when i inquired of the cast members as to what changed most said it was now a locals park and that most people came with annual passes for my family it was a really unpleasant stressful environment there are better places we could have spent out money ,1,2020-02-24
254,Good for family,we love to just hangout with my daughter it was a good park to stay close to your family the only bad thing is getting expensive and lining for a ride is to long ,5,2020-02-24
255,"So much fun, worked well spread over 5 days",we had been waiting till our kids were older and are so glad we did with year olds and a year old it was a great experience the year olds were able to ride alone on every ride we wen on and were old enough to enjoy pretty much everything they rode every ride that was open apart from incredicoaster and smugglers run staying in a disney hotel meant we were close enough to walk and got to enjoy the magic morning every day allowing us to get on rides quicker and start getting fastpass fastpass is a great way to ensure maximum ridding with minimum waiting we managed to be there on quite days and busy days we got the max pass for of the busy days for our whole group and it made a great difference on the other days we just got one max pass and used it to get the photos from characters and rides doing the early entry each day meant we were leaving the park most days at pm as we had done enough and the kids needed rest for the next day ,4,2020-02-24
256,Star Wars wait situation is stupid,the system for star wars ride is ridiculous at am you gotta go into an app to book we had of us try one of us for on and booked we were and now you have to check back all day to see where they are at it took hours so we hung out at park hours we get to ride and the wait is now hours to get on ride yes the ride is cool but the system for something like this in disney is ridiculous come on disney there has got to be better options this one thing put a damper on our day because we had to keep checking back lots of technology challenges apparently that slow the process ,1,2020-02-23
257,AP,we have been aps for many years and this is our second home it s a safe area no matter what other people say i or my daughters have never felt unsafe even walking at night alone we even went once with just us girls ,5,2020-02-23
258,Disneyland in Anaheim California,this was my first trip to disneyland i usually go to disney world in orlando i was a little disappointed the park is small its like they take a little bit of disney world and to make a park out of it the lines are ridiculous its like they penalize you if you dont stay in the disney hotels and pay about dollars a night even though i was in a disney friendly neighbor hotel we were online for and average of an hour to and hour and a half for just one ride so imagine by the time you get on your rd ride with kids they are already exhausted and their feet hurt i honestly will not be going back if i want to spend that amount of money i will do so in disney world we also bought the park hopper tickets but was not worth it being that everywhere we went their were thousands of people the shows that are being done thru out disney close and good seats no matter how early you get are reserved for vip people we were sooo tired from waiting on the lines that we didnt wait for the fire works and didnt stop for any of the shows being that their was no place to sit people were just on the floor and in the streets were their are soo many people stepping from everywhere i feel like its not kid friendly sometimes the bathroom lines are so long that you see kids crying cause they have to go yet this is suppose to be a child playground in overall not really the best place on earth ,1,2020-02-22
259,Amazing!,great amusement park lots of rides and characters were very interactive i highly recommend this park,5,2020-02-22
260,Happiest Place Indeed,we visited with children from ages to everyone had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute shout out to the workers who keep it so clean beautiful ,5,2020-02-22
261,Most happy place in earth!,love disneyland yes you get tire and there is a lot of people but definitely worth it for the little ones dont get the fast pass is pretty useless ,5,2020-02-21
262,WAITING in Line 90mins plus ONLY Once for the kids NEVER AGAIN NEVER ...,waiting in line plus for major rides for the kids once dollar cokes for a park built x y z decades ago profit margin park pass only if you are there mins after park open and stay till security reminds you park is closing get evey moment and most likely still not enough time to see experience half of your goals was good years ago but the waits now no crodw control no park limits good profit but a very very poor value do not stay withon mile of park markup vs value,2,2020-02-20
263,"Just OK, One and Done!",not able to ride all the rides we wanted to because of long wait times and you can only get so many fast passes only saw characters in the star wars area for what they charge for tickets food and drinks i expect more one and done with disneyland ,3,2020-02-19
264,Super crowded,i still love disneyland but my trip over valentine s day weekend has well not all that great absolutely loved galaxies edge smugglers run and rise of the resistance but the lines and the crowds were unbearable fast passes gone in a blink of an eye hour plus long waits for pretty much everything definitely have to plan on when you will be visiting definitely parts of the year to just stay away the crowds will kill your enjoyment ,4,2020-02-19
265,Bday,review i could have chosen to go anywhere for my birthday and i chose this place and i deeply regret it my boyfriend had never gone to a disneyland and i just wanted him to like disneyland as much as i did and when i saw that wasn t gonna happen i got very frustrated trust me i know its super stupid i got in such a bad funk because all we ended up doing was bicker and stay on the phone with customer service on our visit as mentioned he had never visited the park and was hesitant about it since it was my birthday he gave it a try i encouraged begged him to purchase the tickets for february th my birthday he spent on tickets which at the time i assured would be well worth it on our drive up to disneyland i called the customer service line and asked about the max pass i clearly stated that i was most interested in the fast pass benefits the representative encouraged me to purchase the max pass around pm when i got to the park i noticed the max pass app was not working later on an employee told me that they stop distributing fast passes at pm i spent two hours of my time at the park on hold only to be be told that although my chances were slim i could try guest relations so i figured route i don t want to spend the rest of my day fighting at guest relations at this point my boyfriend tried to cheer me up and asked me what were my favorite places to eat i stated new orleans caf and blue bayou both of these places were unavailable and had no openings and could not give me further information on when they would be available i bought food at the french market set my food down and realized i forgot napkins when i went to get some napkins and i came back to my table and a waiter had thrown away my food no blame here i get it i left my food unattended they are just doing their job my favorite rides were also closed indiana jones and haunted mansion again no blame but here our first ride was the jungle cruise was definitely malfunctioning i ve been on it lots of times and the stupid piranhas never came up again this was february please anybody correct me if i m wrong but i can tell something was off to be honest it was like a bad domino effect anything that could ve gone wrong went wrong we did manage to get on a total of rides thanks to this sweetheart employee that was working the line on matterhorn ride i still love disney which is so weird but i felt so awful towards the end of the night i couldn t believe how crappy the experience was i ve had such a great time in the past that i thought it would be the same the lines are way longer than they used to be five years ago and there s literally no space to walk it s not the same disneyland anymore i felt mislead by the maxpass they really should set the proper expectations for people that go there looking for a good time i came back home feeling ripped off and single i don t blame disneyland for my break up i blame myself because i should ve appreciated by boyfriends efforts literally the worst birthday i ve ever had,1,2020-02-19
266,Overpriced for what is offering,you have to wait hours for minutes ride and then again and again for this pleasure you have to spend a fortune good for the shareholders bad for your pocket ,3,2020-02-18
267,Very little magic from most staff.,staff did not even show up for work on time cast members said the reason the attraction was not open for got to get a map ask a cast member where to get one he said ask a cast member they carry some and went back to chatting with another member a big wtf moment for me it was an ok visit took minutes to get thru both check in areas rides were good staff needs better training on disney style manners yeah the pay is not good but my mcdonalds staff service was better smiles are free and it did not cost me to walk in the door ,2,2020-02-18
268,Crowded,magic place for sure but the crowds and congestion make this a great experience that must be tolerated be prepared for lots of strollers and motorized carts to add to the enormous security and check in likes and this is before you even enter the park waits of an hour or more are routine for a minute ride ,4,2020-02-18
269,"Beware: ""Rise of The Resistance"" Reservation",been to disneyland a number of times for whatever reason i always have trouble buying tickets online i usually have to call the park to buy my tickets which means i have to go through the inconvenience of visiting a ticket booth for my ticket before i can enter the park waste of time prices are expensive but i will gladly pay them if it means less crowds doesn t look like it worked the one price complaint i have is the lines for food and other disney items i totally get the wait times for the rides but come on for the price they are charging for food and drink for a chicken sandwich tater tots and ice tea they can hire more cashiers at the food stands to cut down the wait times also we were disappointed this time around as there is a special wait list to get on the rise of the resistance ride if you do not sign up before the park opens you will not get on the ride this was the main reason for our trip so we were not happy to say the least we love disneyland but because of our less than usually good experience we are planning on going to knott s berry farm on our next visit to southern california ,3,2020-02-17
270,We’re kids again!,as always it is a magical experience the lines are long but who cares it is part of it the new star wars experience is awesome too bad the rise of the resistance is full well another reason to go back ,5,2020-02-17
271,Disneyland,disneyland has changed dramatically i remember happy quaint park now too crowded spent more time walking and waiting hours for rides got on a few rides even with fast passes in four days we got very little accomplished in four days miss the days of characters roaming waiting in line for them is hard for young children,1,2020-02-17
272,There aren't enough words so here's the tips,truly was the best part of our trip to la and you have probably read lots of reviews so i will try and give you tips rather than just gushing first of all make sure you download disney app and bring a powerbank because your phone will defintiely run out of battery get there way before the gates open so you are first in to get to galaxy s edge at time of writing this you can t get fastpass for only wear shoes you can walk all day in and your feet will still get sore mid week is lighter crowds than weekends try and stay in anaheim the night before otherwise it s a very early start from la i would do minimum three days but you can get away with two if you plan well choose the park based on how late it is open until for that day do the alternative the second day if you do a third day make the third day a park hopper and go back to the rides you missed or want to do again if you only park hop for one day do it the last day buy park per day tickets and upgrade at the park on the last day you want to park hop saves you money maxpass is worth paying for because of the photos you get linked to it from the park photographers plus it gives you fastpass access on your phone so that you dont have to visit the rides to get the fastpass from the vending poles fastpass will make sure you get onto the super busy rides set timers on your phone and make sure you are on it straight away as you get access again put all the tickets on one phone app so that one person controls fast passes the park photographers take as many pics as you want in all different combinations of people and poses and you have days to download and keep forever those photographers get the right angles and the quality is amazing there are also a few rides that give you pics whilst on them don t pay for water bring bottles and fill them up food is expensive so if you want to save bring lots of food with you but have some budget to try the things you can t get elsewhere like dolewhip wasn t a huge fan but you have to try it right only one starbucks in downtown disney so get one before you go in or as you are changing parks leave your major shopping until the end as you can get most of the stuff at the big store on main street but definitely check out the little stores along the day to see if they have unique items especially with places like galaxy s edge if you are into pins they are not cheap but you get better value if you buy sets keep in mind there are disney stores around america so check out if there s one close to where you ll be visiting you will find bargains there we got a disneyland sweatshirt for half the price because it wasn t current stock we went to the one in vegas shopping outlets ,5,2020-02-15
273,Still a magical place,my wife and i have been to every disney park in the world and our son had been to all of them except california so it had been a while since we had been to disneyland ourselves we had never seen cars land in dca and there s galaxy edge of course but we were really very impressed with the disneyland resort and both my wife and i agreed that we think the anaheim parks are second to only those in tokyo the accessibility of the two parks makes park hopping incredibly easy and the number of attractions keeps you busy morning to night we picked the last week of january because it has historically been one of the slowest weeks of the year but the opening of the rise of the resistance attraction seems to have caused larger than normal crowds both parks were pretty crowded the whole time we were there and we only went on weekdays but buying the max pass was a great idea and it allowed us to enjoy at least additional attractions each day plus gave us all the professional photos and ride photos as a bonus we never waited longer than minutes for anything and we rode every ride in the park at least once and most of them multiple times over days we were pretty blown away by galaxy s edge the theming and attention to detail were extraordinary we were able to ride rise of the resistance five times in five days thanks to advance planning and fast fingers hint for obtaining boarding passes go to the top of the stairs at the disney railroad on main street make sure you have everyone in your party linked and ready on the app and if you have the luxury like we did of having a year old with you have him her count down the seconds to the opening as soon as he starts saying click my status on the home screen this worked for us days in a row and we got boarding groups and granted i am a star wars fan but this is hands down the most amazing amusement park attraction there is right now just fantastic i built a custom droid and our son built a lightsaber in what my wife called dork central and despite the insane cost his saber was a belated christmas s present we were both pretty happy with our creations we all found oga s cantina to be a let down they seated us in the middle of a u shaped booth with a bunch of strangers and we were essentially trapped we couldn t really look around or enjoy the scenery after we finished our drinks we did a lap of the place but sadly we just weren t impressed otherwise though galaxy s edge is remarkable the girls playing rey are awesome and there are constantly stormtroopers and assorted bad guys milling about we even saw chewbacca many times as well as r fun even outside of galaxy s edge we enjoyed pretty much all of the attractions we tried that said i remember the matterhorn being my favorite ride as a kid but it has become so jerky that our one ride on it was wholly unpleasant and man the disneyland space mountain is the darkest one out there i couldn t see anything in there and could never tell where the car was going to go most of the other versions are a little more light inside food and souvenir prices have really become pretty crazy food is definitely cheaper in the international parks and souvenirs were all like at least double what i would be willing pay for a pair of ears for a plastic snow globe what but i guess they charge what the market will bear we ate a nice meal at the blue bayou in the pirates of the caribbean and it was good but my goodness the bill was eye watering but the place was full so what are you going to do as a disney shareholder i get the need for profitability but man we stayed at the grand californian via rented dvc points and that was a relatively good way to go saved a ton of money and stayed in the nicest hotel at the resort walking to the two parks and downtown disney could not have been easier overall we had a wonderful days at disneyland it s unlikely we ll go back soon given our son s age and our proximity more near orlando but frankly we think the disneyland experience is superior to that of disneyworld no need to drive to parks easy park hopping better weather and lesser crowds are all benefits of the anaheim resort enjoy ,5,2020-02-14
274,Valentine's Week at Disney,wow factor included on line app fastpass and mobile dining ordering lines did not feel long due to constant movement and activity at spacemountain and new millineum falcon boarding pass system for resistance ride was a novel concept,5,2020-02-14
275,Military Discrimination,if you have any love for military families please repost i want this to go everywhere i typically dont do lengthy rants like this but disneyland disappointed my daughter wife and myselfto no end here s how as some may know i am a proud navy veteran so i went to the base to get some slightly discounted tickets i spent on two day park hopper tickets which was normally priced at a small discount per ticket disney offers an extra magic hour when you purchase days or more which allows you to enter the park hour early for morning we saved that option for our very last day my family got to the park waited in a long line still only to be turned away at the gate disneyland does not permit military families into the park for magic hour because i got a discount a pitiful discount and they wouldn t allow us to enjoy extra hour after buying two day passes it was the first time i felt punished and embarrassed for being a veteran i expressed my disappointment to two seperate cast members there and one of them turned their back on me and walked away i expressed that nowhere on my ticket does it exclude anything the cast members reposonse was it doesn t say it includes magic hour either the ticket also doesn t say it includes the use of the restrooms or meeting characters or use of water fountains or going on rides i just assume it s part of the ticket admission i m not stating because i m a veteran that i am entitled to anything i dont even stand up at sporting events when they ask vets to stand because i dont want special recognition for it but when a business offers a military discount i usually get the exact same service or product just at a slight discount but disneys position is that since i received such a pitiful small discount that we do not get the benefit disney we are done with your company the way you treated my family left us sad and disappointed with our experience either allow all military the same experience with a discount or simply dont offer one at all i would have paid regular price if i knew you were going to sell me a stripped down version of a ticket this is only the first place i will be leaving a post about disney lack of care and respect for veterans disneyland disney military veterans,1,2020-02-14
276,Fun but Very Pricey,this was our first to disneyland in the past few years the lines moved quickly leading up to the ticket counter the cast member didn t seem all that excited which was disappointing as a first impression security was very quick though the entry line took the longest however the team was very friendly the park was very busy we had a very good time walking through the park and seeing all the attractions we especially enjoyed space mountain and the disney train the line ups for rides were between minute waits the new star wars area was pretty cool and well decorated the fireworks were fun and you could feel the disney spirit the price point is high especially being canadian just for two admissions for one day came out to while fun we most likely won t be back for a few years ,4,2020-02-14
277,Happies Place on Earth,we spent five days at the park and had a great time if you need reservations for anything do it in advance such as the blue bayou the max pass with the fast pass worked out well if you want to ride the new star wars ride you must get in the park find a place to sit and wait for the ride to open and get fast passes when we were there they sell out in seconds or less you can bring food in such as sandwiches snacks or water we walked about miles a day so be prepared for a walk remember to get to the park early since the first hours you can run through lines and after the park empties out most nights we stayed until closing and whipped through lines ,5,2020-02-14
278,Dissapointed!,what happened to the classic disneyland it seems like they just want to cash in nowadays what happened to the days when the employees were in character and friendly we even talked to mary poppins and she scowled at us and said whatever it was she said and kept walking while she said it the employees that operated the rides seemed to be bored the maxpass was a complete waste of money on the first day as we got one set of pictures taken in front of the castle and all of the other rides the photos were down i was going to purchase it the next day in hopes that the photo ops would be back but it literally went up overnight it was on monday and on tuesday i am glad i didnt waste my money because the photos were all down the entire time i was there and the one ride that did have it it would never link to my photopass the lines were not terrible enough that we needed to use the pass for fast passing overall it was just too expensive the magic is gone to commercialism and the employees are not happy like they used to be very sad ,3,2020-02-14
279,First time,after having visited the disney parks in orlando paris tokyo and hongkong we finally made it to disneyland we had a great time both the parks are worth a visit and the waiting times in february were very bearable it s a beautiful park in line with its sister parks all over the world,5,2020-02-13
280,Forget about attending the “rise of the resistance”,unless you are staying in the park have an early season it s impossible we were in the park at am booked to to attend the ride to be informed via the app we were group stand by they only cater for groups per day whilst i am on never have i met such rude disney employees something seems to have changed here in the past years my last visit i feel,1,2020-02-13
281,"Amazing, so much fun",we took our little family here for five days and had so much fun there is something for every age the prices are a bit high for a family but they do not disappoint i highly recommend the disney app do not bother with magic mornings christmas time is so beautiful,5,2020-02-13
282,"New ride ""rise of the resistance"" fail",my family was very disappointed that even though disneyland park was not very busy we still could not get on the new star wars ride rise of the resistance we payed extra to have the maxx passes and even though we got into the park as soon as it opened and had the disney app we still could not get on the ride talking to others we learned that some visitors had gotten into some kind of lottery a month in advance this just seems like a fail on disney s part it was raining on the day we entered the park and not very full it was not peak season or even a three day weekend we met other families at our hotel who said the same thing you should be able to get on all the rides when you pay so much to go to these parks especially when the park is not full ,3,2020-02-12
283,Disneyland is our family's favorite place on Earth!,my wife and i have always enjoyed disneyland but we absolutely love it now that we ve taken our son years old two years in a row it is so much fun to experience it through the eyes of a child we had a day park hopper pass with maxpass and it was perfect we visitied the parks feb contrary to what so many people complain about on here only saturday seemed especially busy and even then we knew how to not let that impact our experience negatively it is crowded in the parks but we ve never had any issues with it we expect that and plan accordingly the park is so clean and the cast members were all very nice the characters were awesome added to the experience maxpass is worth every penny and even on busy days there is no need to wait in crazy lines if you plan and research ahead of time also utilize the disneyland app you can see real time info on wait times for rides and can then use that info to plan your next move also mobile ordering for food on the app is so helpful i cannot tell you how many times we d mobile order our food on our way to a restaurant and just walk up and grab it when it was ready meanwhile bypassing a whole line of people waiting to order i always chuckle at all the schmucks waiting in a long line for dole whip as i just walk up and grab mine that i mobile ordered ahead of time if you take the time to research and plan a little before your visit you will discover so many of these things that can make your experience easier and more enjoyable i have nothing but great things to say about our time in disneyland and will continue to go back ,5,2020-02-12
284,Tips for visitors from the UK,after much research we came from the uk the nd week of february the week before presidents week in the uk the parks quietest times and we had a blast download the disney app and link your tickets before arriving guests from the uk cannot get a maxpass through the app due to a glitch with the postcode section so arrive before line drop and go straight to guest relations where they will sort the issue you can then book your first maxpass for the day you can book another after minutes or after the start time of the booked pass but we found at times you could book again after minutes it will tell you in the app so boarding pass for rise of the resistance i had to rely on disney wifi which is patchy throughout the park but i waited underneath the main street train station and got good wifi at am pressed join boarding group and got group stressful but easy all boarding passes for the day were allocated by am there is no way of getting on the ride without one you have to be in dp to get the pass at am not disney california the app will tell you when to head to galaxy s edge for your ride we were called at noon but the ride broke down when we were people from the front they gave us fastpasses to return the ride was closed for hours then but we kept checking and walked straight on with the fp at pm amazing do not miss this opportunity we used our maxpass well and got to ride every ride we wanted for the day twice for space mountain splash mountain thunder mountain indiana jones star tours we are pros at the passes due to previous florida visits the only queue we had was for peter pan no fp option for this but a family favourite we stayed for the mickey mix and firework show which was great we ate at galatic bites as all restaurants had been reserved by noon food was fine use the app to mobile order no queues at all if you want to do the rides in fantasyland and toontown go late when most families have left the park we saw lots of characters out and about in the park for photo ops a great and tiring day out wear comfy shoes in feb you need a jumper for nightime but t shirt and sun hat during the day ,5,2020-02-12
285,We Love the Original DisneyLand!,the prices are high the crowds are immense the tiredness is real and did i mention everything is expensive no well there are a lot of people and you will pay a lot of money to go but we will be back soon ,5,2020-02-11
286,Disneyland on Superbowl Sunday 2020,ah disneyland resort the land of little red rascal scooters double wide baby strollers and primal beings fighting to get on rides it was closer to the hunger games than a magical day of fun instead of checking for weapons before going in they should issue one like maybe a giant axe or a mace something really primeval okay maybe i m over exaggerating a bit but the park has lost it s magic over the years the bad part about it our family has always been huge disney fans there used to be a time when you could find slower periods during the year we would always go the first week of december it was truly magical the parks were never too crowded christmas decorations were up an it was amazing unfortunately over the years something has changed and it s not because our kids are older and less appreciative the crowds have gotten bigger and less appreciative i think most people don t care about the magic anymore it s all about the marketing and struggling to get on the rides i m not kidding when i say red rascal scooters everywhere i don t remember it ever being that bad take this however you want but the health of our society has really really gone in the toilet booking a fastpass is easy through the app by the way definitely make sure you download the app and connect your tickets to it you re at a serious disadvantage if you don t but honestly you book one pass on one ride that might be it for the day because they fill up so fast disneyland should change that system i had an annual pass to disney world and i could book passes a day up to a few days in advance maybe annual pass holders at disneyland resort have that option also don t kid yourself going on superbowl sunday will not mean the park is less crowded there were about people that could care less about the superbowl game apparently the chiefs the ers shakira j lo or doritos commercials kept anyone glued to the tv set that day ,3,2020-02-11
287,wonderfull but so crowded,so many wonderful attractions including the new resistance amazing and the frozen show beautiful but lineups were excessive often close to an hour and in one case minutes we miss many of the discontinued attractions bugs life country bear jamboree amoung others still the kindest most helpful employees ,4,2020-02-11
288,TOO CROWDED,since adding star wars themed attractions disneyland has become to busy it worries me to bring my young grandchildren and it has lost most of it s magic i know it is necessary to bring new attractions but it is a lot of money to pay to stand in endless lines ,5,2020-02-11
289,Disneyland once again,i love disneyland but it has gotten a little too expensive for our whole family to travel to the happiest place on earth together we some how manage to scrape together the funds it really bothers me that i pay for entrance to the park and then i am expected to pay more to get a flex pass it is nice to not have to wait in line but it bothers me non the less ,5,2020-02-11
290,Magical,what can be said about disneyland that has not already been said an attraction for children of all ages if you are wanting to get boarding for the star wars ride you need to be in the park grounds before opening this can cause some aggressive visitors trying to push their way in front plan your day and your routes i recommend you download the app firstly for boarding but it gives you estimated wait times for other rides and showtimes ,5,2020-02-10
291,"Happiest place on earth, so long as you don't mind insane lines and crowds.",this was probably our rd or th trip to disney and our first where we did a three day park hopper with max pass i am always impressed with the details and passion that have gone into building the park to think of what it must have taken to build and develop it over the years is spectacular just walking around the park is wonderful though you have to be aware of space due to the crowds i also very much appreciate all the work disney has put into healthy food options and special dietary needs we found many vegetarian options and had some great meals at the blue bayou new orleans cafe and snack stands i m not sure how the park would be even bearable without the max pass for online pre scheduling of rides without that the length of the lines are often upwards of an hour which is far beyond the capacity of my year old we waited in long lines to get through security lines to get through the gate and then lines for rides the max pass is a must for expediting lines and for the photos we truly will treasure the one a photographer took of our family at the disney micky statue for rides my daughter loved autotopia a classic big thunder mountain splash mountain and pirates of the caribbean i liked anything with a short line minutes or less to me one disappointment was the magic hour we did this and it did help us to get into smugglers run more on that later but otherwise found it useless most of the park is closed during the magic hour stores rides etc so you have risen early to essentially do more waiting in the park i found the star wars area to be amazing you really feel like you are there however smugglers run was disappointing and i found myself wondering why they didn t build something truly created by disney such as a frozenland with anna elsa based rides my only conclusion is that they are cashing in on the deeper pockets of adults at the expense of the experience of smaller children in part i think they ve lost some of their original charm with the addition of the star wars exhibit we had a wonderful trip and are glad we did it but also think that we ll hold off longer before returning and perhaps will hope that they can figure out a way to reduce the crowd problems ,3,2020-02-10
292,Everything and more,such an amazing place to spend a few days and lots of money if you re not careful so many great rides geared towards all ,5,2020-02-09
293,Star Wars attraction BOOK EARLY,return visit to disneyland to see the new star wars ride unfortunately our hotel did not let us know that you had to book ahead to get a boarding pass for star wars we spent on a park hopper but on arrival signs were up saying all star wars booking passes gone speaking to others you need to be on disneyland app early in morning before am all boarding passes gone in minutes some we spoke to had been at disneyland for days and only got a pass on rd day even then some didn t get on until pm do your research so your not disappointed like us ,3,2020-02-09
294,Crowds crowds and more crowds,been coming to disneyland for over years and now bring my young kids with my husband we ve been season pass holders since but finally let the passes go due to this park becoming unbearable i feel for families coming from long distances dropping k a day for some disney magic because it s become disney misery average ride is at least hour wait but more like hours just not fun lines for everything parking lot security food rides bathrooms meet and greet literally lines for every single thing you do if your planning a family get away i would recommend disneyland paris you can get some great package deals and the park is much less crowded and even with airfare we found it was less expensive then disneyland makes me sad to say this because i love this park and have many happy memories but it s just way too crowded ,3,2020-02-09
295,Bucketlost,i always wanted to do disneyland at news years and we did this time besides having to wait in a spot for three hours for the fireworks and the crowds it is truly the happiest places on earth no drink idiots no drugs just happy families people all around my fourth time here and i just love it ,5,2020-02-07
296,Magical yet frustrating,we took kids ages and one day in each park is plenty we went on all the major rides multiple times definitely pack lunches and snacks cars land was incredible the movie come to life world of color show was very magical but why did they choose mufasa s death scene to include would recommend getting tickets and staying for it using the single rider line can be a huge time saver if you re ok with kids riding separately from you we felt safe for the most part i gave stars because rides were broken for some or all of the day not closed for maintenance but just malfunctioning for the price we paid i find that unacceptable no offer of free snack or souvenir or any compensation so all in all a good experience but not something we will do again ,3,2020-02-06
297,Happiest place on earth,what can i say about disney land its amazing i walked out of this place rubbing my cheeks as it hurt from smiling so much the fozen show was my absolute favourite thing with its snow falling from the ceiling and gorgeous cast all the characters everywhere were gorgeous actually staying in chsracter the entire time my kids will never forget it ,5,2020-02-06
298,Best holiday ever,last visited disneyland years ago the place is ten times better now we spent days nights and still didn t see everything stunning it s a true treat for visitors coming far from overseas wish we had longer to stay never seen a ride like rise of the resistance before amazing also loved all the classics small world pinnochio sleeping beauty castle etc disney must work around the clock to set the bar so high all the night shows are like olympic closing ceremonies epic on scale can t wait to come back day minimum next time or even more if we can ,5,2020-02-06
299,Pretty fun,i was here in late january there was no crowd on and off all the rides quite quickly loved indiana jones the jungle cruise pirates and buzz the haunted mansion was closed for repair a nice day ,5,2020-02-04
300,Perfect for a Day Out!,came here while in the area for a conference and it was perfect for a night out not an overly huge park so it is something you could do in a day we came with a family who has a year old and she had a blast the new star wars area is very well done and was really fun the park was clean the staff was very friendly and the food was good only downfall was trying to find a sit down restaurant there doesn t seem to be many of them here we stayed for the fantasmic show and we were so glad we did overall is a was a great day ,4,2020-02-03
301,Happiest place on early,i go to disneyland every year and it s amazing good thing we live in so cal and can go whenever we want prices keep raising but eh what can you do ,5,2020-02-03
302,Disneyland,had a great fun day with my family excellent fun for all my ten year old grandson was a good age as he could go on all the rides a great holiday for all the family,5,2020-02-02
303,Disappointing,i spent friday here with my daughter many of the rides were closed some of the rides that were open looked like they should have been closed for refurbishment we are used to disneyworld disneyland didn t have that same happiest place on earth feel the stars wars section is the only good part of this park it is definitely not worth the price of admission i would not plan a trip just to go here ,2,2020-02-02
304,Time to be a kid again,wow this place is huge we just got the day ticket next time i will get the day one the place is huge but so much to see trying to go a time when its not busy is not easy some queues were mins wait and a few mins some were worth standing in line for as it seemed to go quite fast great way too spend a day also mke sure you go at night too as when all the rides are lit up it looks amazing,5,2020-02-02
305,Happiest place on earth,took grandchildren to disneyland year olds and we all had best holiday ever the kids were perfect age to go on all the rides and really enjoy the whole international travel experience went to disneyland years ago with our kids and loved it then everything is beautiful and clean great variety of food outlets and the entertainment is amazing really is the happiest place on earth ,5,2020-02-01
306,"It's Disney, don't miss it!!",another great park by disney one not to be missed we spent a long day in here and enjoyed every second of it if you re coming to ride the rise of the resistance you need to get in the park well before it opens and use the app to book your place you ll only have a very short time seconds to secure your ride for the day we did and the ride was great ,5,2020-02-01
307,"Good Times, but slipping standards",i really enjoyed my time at disneyland i went with my adult children and my husband this trip we enjoyed our trip immensely the new galaxy s edge is incredible rise of the resistance is absolutely amazing if you can get in it s a new ride so it will take some time but it s a bummer for those who are traveling from far and don t quite understand how the maxpass and the connectivity with one s cellphone at disney parks works if you are going to disneyland i recommend you get yourself familiar with the parks app and familiarize yourself also with the maxpass and how it works if you are interested in riding rise of the resistance you must have a good understanding of those two things our experience at disneyland was as usual amazing but the cast members were not friendly as they had been in the past i have to say though that it was a lot more fun this trip with the characters as they seem to be free to roam about the park and have personal interactions with anyone without waiting in a line it was great fun and i look forward to my next trip with my family oh one more note disney is slipping a little the park was not as clean as it has been in the past the streets weren t as swept but worse the bathrooms were definitely not as clean ,4,2020-02-01
308,Crowd Disneyland During a Light Crowd Day,i picked this day to go to disneyland because all of the websites visited said the last week in january on a t th would be very light it wasn t it was still crowded when close to closing time i love disneyland but i think i m done with this place its just not worth it ,3,2020-02-01
309,Birthday,second trip to disneyland and still havent seen it all day pass too much to see and do which is great the little things you learn like how each ride slightly changes each time especially indiana jones loved the rides the food the shopping and just generally everything will come back again in a few years ,5,2020-01-30
310,Galaxy's Edge is an out of this world experience,took my star wars crazy year old and had a ball we went in the first week of the new rise of the resistance ride and got in the virtual queue both days you do need to be physically in the park at am though to achieve that which really meant queuing from am we were there before that the amount of time and planning and money that has gone into making batuu so authentic is just incredible and really appreciated wonderful fun spending far too much money ,5,2020-01-30
311,Great family time,great for all the family some lines were long but overall not too bad we went on a weekday weekends are busier,4,2020-01-30
312,The Moose outside should have told you,the shuttle service to the hotel can be confusing because it s going to be hours when you return and you ll be exhausted if you remember you likely have a photographic memory the exit is much better than leaving orlando staff is always super nice engaging helpful park is super clean shows are great bathrooms and stroller parking is very friendly it s hard to not have a great time at disney now for the constructive feedback pricing structure do what you think is best but your pricing is raising multiple generations who will never come to the park they will find other activities and their kids will take their kids to those activities your core customer is in their s and your park is not friendly to mature bodies update the website to project rides under maintenance people travel thousands of miles and spend s of thousands of dollars and don t want to be surprised by this and it s not ok if the moose outside should have told you rides are some of the best around ,4,2020-01-28
313,Great time,my best friend and i went to disneyland on a girl s trip park was crowded but lines moved quickly we were able to get on most rides within minutes food in park is expensive but very good we had an amazing time ,5,2020-01-27
314,Max pass so worth it but not the magic mornings,the longest we stood in line was at the older rides because they did not have max pass everywhere else maybe min sometimes no wait at all magic mornings were not worth it if anything on magic mornings i would recommend going to the park that does not have it,5,2020-01-27
315,Making Memories,we got the day park hopper pass i would recommend getting the max pass and using the disney app to avoid long lines we heard a lot of mixed reviews about the new rise of the resistance ride it is tricky to actually get on the ride but we really loved it my year old thought it was great too in order to get on the ride i would suggest getting the tickets that let you into the park an hour early you must be scanned into the park every person you want on the ride and already have your tickets linked on the app once all are scanned into the park click to join a group on the ride and hope you got there early enough we went on friday which means the park stays open until midnight we got group as an alternate we got on after pm and the last group they took was if we had tried on a weekday we wouldn t have made it it was a magical trip for us my son would have spent the whole trip in the star wars area if he could have ,5,2020-01-27
316,Skip the line a must,we did both parks in one day with the skip the line pass if you want to visit every store there you need a week did all the rides at adventure land by am then went accross to disneyland took a bit longer but still had time to go back as adventure land had better rides eg cars land and rollercoaster ,5,2020-01-27
317,Magic,we last visited disneyland in we spent days in the park with our kids who were teenagers it was a truly magical experience as a retailer i recall walking away marvelled at the consistency of the service experience and training that must have sat behind it seemed like every cast member was proud to be disney we ve now been to different theme parks around the world and disneyland now doesnt feels so special we were gobsmacked by cast members standing around talking not greeting guests and seeming not that interested couldn t get on the new star wars ride you can only get on a boarding group through the app and although we tried days in a row at dead on am the best we could do was group also known as no chance the system is rigged somehow we d be standing next to grouos of people who would be in and assigned a group only for our access to pop up seconds later some kind of disney prioritization most likely for people who jot only paid the exorbitant entry fee but also the additional for fast pass max food is limited and expensive even if it s just the two of you disneyland is great if you haven t been there or any of the disney parks the first time for us we found california adventure a more genuine experience for adults at least ,3,2020-01-26
318,Magical!,we just returned from our kids first trip and left amazed the park carries a charm that lasts through the years we are looking forward to our next trip ,5,2020-01-26
319,Disneyland,always awesome have been so many times i have lost count and each trip is better than the last ,5,2020-01-25
320,Great Low Season Visit,i ve been to disneyland multiple times and this was the first time i can actually say it was low season for sure get the disneyland app and look and see what wait times are for popular rides because it ebbed and flowed throughout the day you can also use the app to order food from certain restaurants at the park which saved time i didn t get the max pass this time but i think it s a must during mid or high season we didn t park hop and i feel like the parks are getting to be busy enough where you don t need that anymore the characters are always amazing the app also shows where and when characters will be and so that was nice to be able to plan around that ,5,2020-01-24
321,Disney magic is real,it s disney i won t ever say anything bad it s truly magical heads up for rise of the resistance i got boarding pass at am the last boarding call was so if you don t get the boarding pass in first minute you likely won t get on the ride also once at the ride be prepared to wait at least an hour however it s a crazy experience and a lot of fun even for non star wars fans also check the calendar we love tinker bell and the fireworks but they weren t on on the day we went ,5,2020-01-24
322,What's not to love!?,we love disneyland we were there for opening weekend of rise of the resistance it was amazing i got the max passes which helped with excessive walking but still walked miles in one day ,5,2020-01-23
323,"The First, The Original",since opening in disneyland in anaheim has continuously evolved and improved it set the groundwork for the development of the other disney parks in florida asia and europe disneyland is a place where visitors can easily spend an entire day or more once you enter the park there are storage lockers food vendors to buy snacks and beverages restaurants rest rooms and water fountains souvenir and clothing shops visitors can meet disney and star wars characters throughout the park and walk down main street usa to sleeping beauty s castle you can visit adventure frontier fantasy tomorrow lands critter country toontown and the new galaxy s edge it is a place where both old and young can become lost in time children can feel a little bit older and grandparents can become young again without needing to feel self conscious it is a place to find fun and adventure in the past or the future a place to experience fantasy all in a well maintained clean friendly and safe environment ,5,2020-01-23
324,Brisbane to Disney fantastic holiday,we were here for five days from morning till night with four kids years old stayed at courtyard marriott which was great but if you can stay on site would recommend as kids and grandma get easily tired felt totally safe and food options were great from junk to healthy absolutely recommend the disney resort for brunch where all the disney characters entertain the kids not cheap for adults and kids but fantastic experience also best part was the star wars experiences just an amazing holiday strollers for hire for younger kids st day so bring a cheap one to leave at hotel again very safe secure fun happy place for a holiday three days would be ok to and give opportunity to visit universal use ziggies car service to be collected from la airport return exec service ,5,2020-01-21
325,1st trip to Disneyland,so much fun for the whole family had the park hopper pass and days to spend between the parks we loved it but our feet hated us by the end spent hrs a day there ,5,2020-01-21
326,Amazing in true Disney style,we often to to disney world however this was our first time to disney land and we absolutely loved it there were so many great food options other than the normal fast food you see everywhere we also loved seeing a part of the original park that walt built amazing ,5,2020-01-21
327,Fun Time in Disneyland,my family and friends had a great time at disneyland it was our first time to visit disneyland and we spent the entire day exploring the park and riding rides it was easy to find our way around the park and the wait time for rides was bad at all we also really enjoyed the food thanks disney for a great day ,5,2020-01-20
328,The happiest place on earth,my husband and i were in anaheim without our four kids but we decided to go check disneyland out since we were a block away being an east coast resident i ve been to disneyworld before as a teenager this was so fun staff were all so friendly and the food was good even though you pay dearly for it haha ,5,2020-01-20
329,"Long lines, lost of people.",for a much faster line experience use the single rider line if you re a party of or it s much quicker and you ll probably be on the same ride as your party if not just behind them magic morning is for only half the park if you use magic morning spend the morning there until it s too busy go and have a nap at your hotel come back at pm when all the small children leave and the lines will be short until midnight ,3,2020-01-20
330,"Get there early, wear comfy shoes",get there early we arrived when gates opened but even then the ride queues became long very quickly the app is great and we were able to get around the rides we got on were great we went to go on pirates for nd ride but it broke down after min in the queue loads of food available at prices you d expect here great day loads to see we all had a great time,5,2020-01-20
331,A few things we found helpful.,this was my third disneyland visit last were years ago when it was a much quieter park and the first for my husband and kids we prepurchased a day park hopper at a ticket office opposite the disney entrance a few shops to the right of denny s when you are facing it and saved around i did extensive research on multi websites including disney and expedia and unless purchasing day or more passes no real discounts available park hopper ticket we weren t sure if this was going to be worthwhile but so pleased we paid the extra money it was great to have the flexibility to go between the two parks and target specific shows activities best to pre buy ticket to remove another line from your day entry to parks on arrival at the parks you pass through security bag search and metal detector and enter a sterile area that allows you then to chose which park to enter if you hop between parks you don t need to go through security again but you do need to go through the ticket stiles entry time check park opening hours each day as they vary and for maximum bang for buck try to be there in january on weekdays an hour prior to listed opening time as ticket stiles often open to allow early park entry you get into the park pre opening hour and they have a hold you at a roped off area inside the park rope is dropped at opening time giving you a little head start to get to popular rides maps grab paper maps for the parks at the ticket stiles they have all the information re fastpass rides heights for accessing rides etc marked on them really useful and imho easier than checking your phone all the time fastpass we used this to get close access views to night shows again check on the disney website which night shows are on and if fastpass can be used on the days we visited we found it quicker to use the single rider lines available on some rides than the fastpass snacks and water bottles you can t take a packed picnic lunch but you are allowed sushi sandwiches and snacks food inside the park is ott expensive talk about captive audience so we took lots of fruit and snacks and refilled our water bottles clothing in january for australians coming from the heat long pants long sleeved top puffer jacket for evening kids did wear caps at times and we used our sunnies we had a great days and stayed from open to close both days we commented that we couldn t have managed a third day without a rest day in between an awesome experience for adults and kids ,5,2020-01-19
332,Day trip from Las Vegas,went on a tuesday day trip to disneyland with a group from my univerisity sufficed to say i am an older student it was a long journey by bus but we got there one hour after opening and spent the whole day there the last time i went to disneyland was over years ago i wish i had more than one day but i got to do mostly everything i wanted it helped that it was after the school break for most people and it wasn t on a weekend i brought in a backpack with some snacks and water i never had an issues on the rides and just put it by my feet if you can go to the single rider line you might get on the ride faster then in a group of folks there is the option of using fast pass but the time difference was about minutes for me so i didn t mind the wait it is a theme park so prices can be high for food and souvenirs so it can t hurt to make a plan of how much you want to spend there is no restriction on bringing your own snacks so that can help relieve some expenses i like the fact the cast will assist and take pictures for you with your camera phone i was impressed with cast members who all genuinely took the time to listen to kids and spend time chatting with them and not hurrying them along i definitely enjoyed this visit and would love to go again ,5,2020-01-17
333,Disneyland is iconic,haven t been to disneyland in about years it is still a great adventure and fun for the whole family all of the classic rides and activities are still there it was kind of like old home week good to see the old friends ,4,2020-01-15
334,Skip the fast pass and go to the single rider line to avoid the long wait,disneyland is still great after all these years a couple of tips to avoid the long lines first visit during the non peak times early october to mid november mid january through mid march mid april to early may the fast pass app is overrated and not worth it the way it works is that on your app you will see that the fast pass is available for certain rides and a certain time for example your fast pass will be available for the indiana jones ride at pm the problem is that if you get to this attraction minutes late you will still have to wait minutes yeah still better than an hour wait but there is a better option whenever available ride on the single rider line this will cut you wait time from minutes to minutes i used this on all three days that i was at disneyland park and california adventure eat a hearty breakfast before going because the food prices are expensive ,5,2020-01-15
335,Its Disney after all,i mean what is there is say i ve been to disney all over the world and this one delivers just as the others do main street is great the castle is the smaller than the other parks but whatever tomorrowland fantasyland westernland new orleans adventureland all just great fun and galaxys edge spectacular i spent a full day here no complaints great for families friends couples solo travellers and all else in between ,5,2020-01-14
336,Better than the other side!,i have never been to disney until yesterday disneyland is very different to the adventure park this has better eateries in our opinion and is more upmarket it is a little similar to universal with the design the shops are all full of merchandise to buy obvs a little too much for us but hey it s disney the max passes are a great idea we managed to do all the rides we wanted within a six hour time span glad we ve done it better side for adults i feel also one thing to note on the wet rides may be better to bring a spare sweatshirt mine was wringing wet all day or do the wet rides last enjoy it s disney your happy place ,4,2020-01-13
337,Great time!,had a great couple of days here two days was more than enough to cover both parks the max pass app is well worth the money even just to take advantage all of the souvenir photos straight to your mobile and being able to book time slots helped with the longer queued rides you can even order food to be ready for a time slot collection via the app my only complaint is that they confiscated my selfie stick on entry you could take it back to your car or hotel but my hotel was a minute walk away apparently they are banned in disney for safety reason like that s the biggest safety problem in america if you look hard enough on the website you ll find this out in the f q section but why would you even look this up it also says you can have it back upon exit not true they confiscate that many there s no way you would find yours again oh well still had a great time ,5,2020-01-13
338,The happiest place on Earth,as a family with teenagers from visiting for the first time with our parents we had the best time it truly is magical no matter what age you are we had a day pass and that was sufficient time although would recommend more time during peak times there is something for everyone ,5,2020-01-13
339,First Disneyland trip for kids,other than expensive which is expected the kids and i had a fantastic time it was definitely worth getting the fastpass max pass the photo ops were more worth it in california adventure as i felt we seen more characters there than disney we got the day hopper passes and once again worth it as we could bounce around both parks during the days the color your world show at california is a must see also download the disney app as you can get fast passes right away once you use the previous one and shows all the wait times for all rides it also uploads all your pictures from rides with th max pass,5,2020-01-13
340,Tad dated,overall a good day out but disneyland felt tired and dated and the food was very dissapointing as were the signs for amenities ,3,2020-01-11
341,Cool to see how much work goes into these parks,we loved all the details that went into the park and the rides we went in during non peak season and still waited about mins average for most rides during peak season and in the heat this would not be fun there are some lines with lots of entertainment along the wait line some of the rides that we booked with a fast pass that had big lines all day were super short and we would have been mad if we had to spend mins waiting in line for them overall we hit most rides we wanted to and hit most of the park in a rush you definitely need to get there for park open food is extremely expensive for two pieces of pizza and a pop it was almost usd which would be about cad for us overall we had a good time but did a lot of waiting there are not fireworks here every night like they orlando locations i would highly recommend paying the extra per person to update to a fast pass especially during peak season ,4,2020-01-11
342,Disneyland is one of my favorite parks!,i love the fact that disneyland park is so nostalgic historical i ve also noticed how friendly the cast members are although it seems like there aren t as many photographers as wdw has the next time i go i want to do the walk in walt s footsteps tour ,5,2020-01-11
343,It really is The Happiest Place on Earth!!,my adult daughter and i had one day to spend at disneyland park neither of us had ever been to disney and all i can say is it really is the most magical happiest place on earth we thoroughly enjoyed our day there and were as captivated as small children we used the max fast pass wisely as we only had the one day and were able to ride everything we wanted to the new millennium falcon ride splash mountain pirates of the caribbean hyperspace mountain star force indiana jones the haunted mansion nemo and small world everything was amazing the rides the ultra friendly staff the little shops the characters disney main st star wars galaxy edge toon town all of it it was at christmas time too so it was extra magical totally worth the outrageous ticket prices ,5,2020-01-11
344,Disneyland at Christmas,we hadn t been to disneyland in december for many years you see the commercials and it looks magical we decided to splurge for an adult only two day trip we opted for the two day single park pass and did ca adventure one day and disneyland the next it was raining pretty hard the day we were at ca so there were no crowds we could walk on to almost anything and quickly did everything we wanted to we decided to eat in downtown disney to dry off and had lunch at tortilla joes very yummy disneyland the next day thursday was a very different story it was very crowded we pulled fast passes for the big rides new star wars haunted mansion bobsleds indiana jones and rode the less crowded rides in between fast passes haunted mansion and its a small world had the longest lines due to being decorated for the holidays definitely get ff for these rides the parade and fireworks evening show was wonderful and it snows on main st disney does magic well just know that it is busy everywhere in the park and bring your patience go back to your hotel during peak times and be prepared that when it gets dark the park gets even busier we found the park to be wonderful even with the crowds ,5,2020-01-10
345,Disneyland,it got a day pass that cost approximately usd it s best to plan out your activities and if you have a must do ride i would suggest that is the first thing you head to i arrived at am finished at pm you can take a bag in food and drink is ok about mins to buy my ticket and get through the gates rides i liked star wars millennium falcon matterhorn splash mountain and indiana jones the train and monorail were also good for a time out relax costs about usd for the mickey ears usd for bottle water soft drink usd for burger meal the new star wars town looks great especially lit up at night fast pass scan your ticket near the ride and get a fast pass time slot where you can come pack and skip the standby line it s like a reservation system one ride was min wait via fast pass whilst the standby time indicated mins line up time you can only have one fast pass at a time i think it s better to chase you preferred rides early there is an app that you can use for this but you pay an extra usd per day per ticket for this and free wifi is pretty good around the park if you don t have much time you could do disneyland in one day and stick to the things you are interested in ,4,2020-01-10
346,"From Australia, visited January 2020. Loved Disneyland - took kids 10, 12, 15. Wifi absolutely terrible though",we stayed just off of the grounds at an airbnb that was a minute walk to the park absolutely loved the experience some takeaways though wifi is terrible maxpass is great but you need data very frustrating to rely on the park wifi it is about as good as the worst airport wifi in the world drops out every two minutes and does not cover the whole park not even close make sure you buy a us sim card stood in queue for mins for the new star wars ride quite a let down the starwars area was very well done though fireworks were inexplicably cancelled at the last minute higher elevation winds to blame there was not a breath of wind and there were no test flares sent up to verify obviously another issue that was not shared monorail broken down multiple times this created a long walk home for us could use some signs without wifi it was difficult to figure out where you were using the disney app rides were not signed at all if you are using the manual fastpass these were very difficult to find staff very friendly and helpful characters were great overall a great experience but the price tag is high so expectations of everything being of the highest quality ,4,2020-01-10
347,"Still good, but queues are ridiculous.",we came here on the th and th of december we ve been here a number of time before and this time the queues were ridiculous we literally only used the fastpass mechanism and had very few photos taken to optimise the experience the new galaxy s edge is great but you can t use your early morning entrance to get to it early our mistake but we were at rope drop at am to get their early and still ended up even after a fast walk having to wait minutes to get on the millennium falcon ride great ride but not worth waiting minutes the light show was cancelled one night as there was a mild wind and they only tell you when it s about to start so you waste time waiting again i really enjoyed the light up small world show our favourites are still buzz light year ride and rail road mountain millennium falcon if you get in quickly there is no fastpass for this ride either each year the magic gets less and less the price gets more and more the place gets more packed the shows get better and better but think we ll give it a skip for the next few years ,4,2020-01-09
348,Definitely not Magical (Visited Dec 30th and 31st), long review i am a huge disney world fan because when i go it takes me to a total world of magic everyone is friendly well organized and just beautiful this was not my experience at disneyland unfortunately and i was truly heartbroken we stayed at paradise pier and walked across the street to enter the park by walking through the grand californian hotel our first day we experienced no issues with entering this way and also exited the park through the hotel to get back to our hotel we attempted to take the same route to get to the park the following day and a cast member abruptly pushed me back and said that i couldn t come through this way i explained to her that i was staying at paradise pier and i have a key for the hotel so it should be fine she continued to proceed to push me back and then closed the gate in my face stating that i could not come in unless i was actually staying on that property i felt like a diseased person who was not worthy of entering the property i have stayed onsite at numerous disney world hotels and have never experienced such rudeness or been turned away from entering a property before for the cast member to physically place their hands on me was uncalled for and downright unacceptable for this being my first visit to disneyland this treatment has definitely confirmed that it will be my last the park is full of inconveniences obtaining ride photos we purchased the photo package max pass so that we could download all of our professional photos for our memory book instead of having a bunch of selfies we were unaware that for ride photos you had to obtain the ridiculously long code that is shown on the screen to download your ride photos this is automatic if you stay onsite and have a magic band at disney world i ended up missing my first photo that was taken at am and i was informed that i would have to wait until pm to go to the front of the park to look it up for downloading the photo to my app it was pretty complicated to pull up the disneyland app to wait for it to load to enter the code in time or to pull up the qr code for scanning recommend allowing for it to be added to apple wallet but until that is available we had to take a screenshot of it and make it our lock screen on our phones fast passes fast passes are very different than disney world you can only book them once you re at the park and you have to remember to book the next one every minutes fast passes were unavailable for the big rides by pm my son was unable to join us for the extra magic hours at the park due to a medical condition he was going to join us at am due to my son not physically being at the park we were unable to book any fast passes for him to join us this was very upsetting as the fast passes that we were attempting to book were for a am timeframe by the time my son arrived at the park at am the fast passes for the ride that we wanted to book for were now at pm having to wait mins before booking another fast pass was a hassle and i feel we didn t get the full value of the extra money we paid for the feature cast member rudeness we attempted to go to small world before the parade began the entire area was roped off and the cast members would not let you cross the street even though the parade was not set to start for another mins they stated we would have to walk all the way around through adventureland to star wars if we wanted to get through never would have happened at disney world the cast member also threatened a patron because he had his stroller within a roped off reserved area behind a trash can there wasn t a single person within the reserved area but the cast member taunted the patron and threatened to call security on him if he said anything or didn t move the stroller my son needed to use the restroom and had to walk all the way to tomorrow land they had the area roped off where the nearest restroom was and told him to find another one because he could not cross once again the parade had not started we booked a fast pass for small world returned to small world at our fast pass timeframe when we arrived to the area to cross the street to get to small world we were informed that it was one way traffic we stated that we were going for our fast passes for small world the cast member stated oh it s closed i asked why didn t the app inform me of this he stated they closed it on their own accord and they didn t know if they would open it again for the evening he said we could take our fast passes and use it for another ride patience was very limited at this point due to it being pm we had been there since am and we walked all the way from the front of the park indiana jones to the back of the park through a bunch of blocked off pathways one way traffic pm we wanted to get a picture of the castle with fireworks behind it all routes to the castle were blocked off if we wanted to see them we would have to go around through star wars from tomorrowland through adventure land and back to main street to view them because of the one way traffic forget it my son and i were walking towards the front of the park around pm we wanted to turn around to get ice cream from a parlor that was literally stores back the other way a cast member told us we couldn t go back because it was one way traffic if i wanted to go to the ice cream store i would have to walk through tomorrowland to fantasyland back to the front of the castle and back down to the ice cream parlor to get ice cream needless to say disney lost out on money we left the park in a not so great mood that evening overall disneyland needs to take a page out of disney world s courtesy and kindness book as i was definitely shocked by how poorly we were treated of course there were some very nice cast members that we met along the way but the rude and unkind ones that i experienced throughout the day really left a bad taste in my mouth i won t be returning ,2,2020-01-09
349,I wish I back to my childhood!,every time i go to disneyland i wish i can back to my childhood excellent time to spend one full day in disneyland with entertainment happiness time but the problem is with the queues but it s worth also there is a lot of restaurants cafes around the park many shops are available,5,2020-01-09
350,Food options are limited,i was really surprised at the poor quality of the food at disneyland there is very little if any that is prepared fresh for you even with the prices that are charged eat lunch outosde and come back in for your entertainment ,4,2020-01-08
351,Great Christmas Experience,we visited disneyland park for the first time during the christmas season the park was well decorated and full of christmas cheer we really enjoyed the re themed small world and haunted mansion attractions for the holiday season they are a must see ,5,2020-01-08
352,Fantastic,it had been years since i had been to disneyland wow this place is fantastic i was able to get a fastpass for most everything that i wanted to do that usually had long lines i was trying to figure out why i liked the disney parks better that all other theme park the answer i m quite a bit portly and at places outside disney i can only ride about the rides i one park i went to i could only ride of the many rollercoasters at disneyland and disney california adventure i was able to ride every ride including the rollercoasters no restraint was too small for me to get into it ,5,2020-01-08
353,The Happiest Place on Earth!,it s true disneyland really is the happiest place on earth we spent one day here that was absolutely perfect from start to finish we loved it so much that we just had to do another and there s just so much to see if you re going to go to disneyland then i d recommend a multi day pass as there s just far too much to get through see in a single day park hopper is great too so that you have the ability to hop between the adjacent adventure park all through the day disneyland is amazing all the different themed lands down to the very last detail are all so exquisitely created the setting the rides the shops the food even the bathrooms are unique to each land you ll feel like you re really there most of the rides are awesome in particular cars incredicoaster and indiana jones are simply amazing even the food is great and is actually very reasonably priced and everything that we ate was to a very high standard the staff are fantastic and friendly we even received a few freebies throughout the course of the day and they re absolutely fantastic with all the little kids around the maxpass which includes photopass and fastpass is very reasonably priced the base ticket park hopper is rather pricey though which gives you access to all photos taken on the rides and disney photographers across the park and use of the fastpass feature the fastpass feature is really good if you know how to use it so i d highly recommend reading up on this before your purchase visit the only downsides to disneyland really is that it is ridiculously busy which can make the time waiting in lines quite significant the price of a ticket is quite steep and the wifi coverage is a bit spotty however on both our days peak days we never found the wait times to be too unreasonable plus the fastpass is a great way to get around them anyway overall we had an amazing experience at disneyland we d absolutely love to go back but would also like to check out the other parks too ,5,2020-01-08
354,Disney CA,of course this is the happiest place on earth a great place to visit never to old to go hear can be very busy so ensure you grab fast passes to skip long queues take your time and stay to the end for the show it s absolutely fantastic be sure also not to miss the street parades as well so plan your day night recommend a day pass to ensure you experience all that is to see ,5,2020-01-08
355,Not worth the price of admission with the extremely long lines and limited ride access.,purchased tickets online ahead of time for per person arrived at park at am parked but lines were so long to take shuttle to park that we walked minutes arrived same time as buses so good for the exercise if you like it we brought a backpack with rain poncho highly recommended if you go on splash mountain some snacks water and sunscreen took minutes to reach front gate even with prepurchased tickets then another hour to get through line to have your bags searched then another minutes in line at city office to upgrade to max pass another per person the max pass includes photos taken of you during specific rides that can be uploaded to your phone for days from visit plus allows you to make reservations on most popular rides for scheduled time slots but you can only reserve one ticket every hours so realistically you can only get reservations per whole day that sucked some rides were booked out hours the disneyland app is worth downloading to see wait times on specific rides to plan ahead but bring a batter pack charger because after hours your phone will be super low in battery power and you will want to recharge it we were at the park hours total but wasted the first few hours just getting in i recommend you do the fastpass though the lines for that are almost as long as the regular lines indiana jones broke down when we were there which kept us waiting minutes in the line trapped until it was fixed there were rude obnoxious people who cut into line at the matterhorn when everyone who had been standing in line for plus hours commented to the employees on the party who was cutting in line and lying about it they said they d take care of it rubbish they let the group on with no consequences they should have been removed from the park food was very expensive and you needed reservations to eat lunch at most of the places which are apparently also made on the disneyland app we didn t know this some rides closed at dark which was disappointing there were just so many people that it was wall to wall bodies amazing that they don t limit the number of guests because it was not a pleasant experience fighting people every single step of the way and when did haunted house become an ad for nightmare before christmas and space mountain is now all star wars themed too that was my last visit to the magic kingdom at per person plus parking per vehicle it was ridiculous for what we experienced ,3,2020-01-07
356,Birthday treat,in the day i visited the park it was severely overcrowded and too expensive especially considering the excessive crowding prohibited us from fully experiencing the attractions ,2,2020-01-07
357,The Original and Best,we visited from the uk with our year old daughters we had been to orlando before but the experience in california is a little different eg fast pass system but we had an amazing holiday we ll never forget we are interested in the history of disney hence our trip to the original disneyland it s a great park had everything you d expect as well as the faultless service and experience of disney the fireworks show was beyond belief even disney can make it snow in california our only criticism would be that toon town seems a little dated had roger rabbit been in florida he d have been relegated by now but i guess they like to keep some of the heritage in the california park a must do for disney fans across the world you won t be disappointed ,5,2020-01-07
358,Fun but so crowded,we took a family trip with young adult children during thanksgiving on thanksgiving day it was pouring rain and we were glad we planned to visit parks on friday and saturday we upgraded to get fastpass on the disney park app i think it was per person per day it did allow us to get more fastpass entrances each day without physically walking to each ride the crowds were huge over the holiday weekend and my son hated it so only spent a couple of hours each morning when crowds were less one of my daughters wanted to buy certain foods at the park be prepared to spend a small fortune on hotels park tickets parking and food in the parks i walked more than miles each day so wear comfortable shoes this was a return visit after many years it is a magical place but nicer if you can go at a less crowded time midweek and not during a holiday avoid school vacations the christmas decorations were beautiful ,4,2020-01-07
359,Very it all started for Disney!,so exciting to see the original castle attractions etc where it all started for walt my daughter got to visit with mary poppins her favorite and this totally topped off a wonderful day in the park due to its smaller size than disney world we were able to enjoy almost all of the park in a long but excellent day ,5,2020-01-07
360,"Crowds make it so tough, app is not all that great",we knew disneyland would be crazy right after new years but that is the schedule that we could accommodate with school age grandchildren had no idea how tough the experience is even with max pass and using the disney app first day we were there jan at disneyland park we were able to ride rides the entire day we had max pass which is nice to be able to do fast passes from your phone but too many rides fast passes are sold out by midday and the big rides like indiana jones are out by am timing really couldn t have been worse when fast passes were involved too because standby lines even for lesser rides were an hour plus long so trying to time waiting in line for a ride then having to waste time doing nothing shopping etc because we couldn t get in another standby line or we would miss our fast pass times the app is very glitchy had to shut it down and restart many times as it would freeze up on the fast pass page and you couldn t get to another page order food or see what other fast passes were available when you hadn t used that fast pass yet one tip for those planning on eating at the park use the app to pre order your food where you can my husband went to stand in line at the burger place in tomorrowland and i sat at a table with the kids and started playing with the app for food service i was able to place the order and get the pick up notification before he even made it up to the cashier to order so just called him to get out of line and head to the pick up window i will say though that they totally screwed up the order and i had to go back to the window with my phone to show the order it s almost like they hadn t even looked at our order as none of the sides and two of the five main entrees were incorrect we used this pre order feature in california adventure and it was perfect getting around the park was just difficult with so many people after going to disneyland for the last years this trip was definitely lacking in magic for as much as you pay for two day pass to get rides a day and of course spending as much as we did for food and tchotchkes the value just wasn t there ,3,2020-01-06
361,The original of perfection,i did have second thoughts about my recent visit to disney because well it is quite pricy but as soon as you make it through the endless lines and enter the park you seem to forget it more and more the park is just extraordinary beautiful and filled with beautiful details and joy all over i really enjoyed the christmas time because everything seems to become a bit more magical i was happy and the park wasn t too crowded the fast pass option in california is really great and gives everyone the same chances in florida you have to book months ahead and still don t have full occupancy so i really liked that i do have some to criticize again concerning the prices i bought one of those beautiful popcorn buckets which coasts well that is a bit pricy but disney is disney what is really cheap is not offering refills like in other parks i mean what does popcorn cost i mean come on in florida they fill up the bucket to the top generously but you get just a regular large bag poorly fitted into the bucket so that you might not accidentally get one corn too much really i mean i paid for a plastic thing with light and popped corn probably worth the popcorn was cold and old so yeah what a disaster see you next time disney i will come again ,5,2020-01-06
362,Fun but busy and expensive,i have been to disneyland many times over years and always enjoy it it s clean friendly and well organized but wow do they ever pack them in now amazing number of electric scooters when did this become a thing i felt bad for those in wheelchairs and parents with strollers as the crowds made it almost impossible to get anywhere also i m glad we took snacks and drink in because food prices were crazy for a small slice of pizza souvenirs also expensive a basic phone case that would be in a mall was the max pass was worth the to get extra fast passes to avoid the hour waits at the popular rides ,4,2020-01-06
363,Undercover Tourist Disneyland Tickets,i recently purchased disneyland tickets from undercover tourist i have also purchased tickets from them in the past for disney world in florida both times i was extremely satisfied on my most recent trip to disneyland we saved per ticket the best part was that we did not have to stand in line at the ticket booth to exchange them like you do with so many discounted ticket vendors ,5,2020-01-06
364,"Like Running a Marathon, Only Different",wear comfortable shoes people really be prepared to walk and stand in lines for everything the bathroom yeah a line for that you want a churro yeah better get in line early for that forget having your picture taken with one of the characters i would suggest getting a map in advance and designating a route that everyone agrees on early also take advantage of the max pass features with fast pass privileges ,4,2020-01-06
365,Christmas Visit,we finally had a chance to visit disneyland at christmas we expected the park to be decorated a bit more so we were a bit disappointed we are used to six flags going all out at christmas with their park decor and lights the castle lighting was impressive as well as the haunted mansion and its a small world changing there rides to a christmas theme the fast pass system didn t make sense since every time we tried to get one the machines were either down or our return times were for hours later just made sense to wait the min hour wait for the ride now we have been at christmastime but will go back to six flags since we enjoy their decorations and rides much better ,3,2020-01-06
366,Ehhhh,not what is use to be staff members are on phones or talking and it is getting pretty clear it s all about the the wait times are pretty ridiculous wait in line for hours and have minutes of actual fun ,3,2020-01-06
367,The Original,disneyland is an american original and as a disney fan i needed to go to the place where it all began the theming attractions and overall experience are great we opted for the maxpass which allows for almost hourly fastpass experiences we did disneyland park and california adventure in one day which was relatively easy to do we stayed at a local hotel which offered us an easy rest period midday would i go back maybe ,4,2020-01-05
368,they treat handicapped seniors well,our dtr and husband treated us to disney on the sun after t giving she got us the scooters as both my husband and i are semi handicapped and they wanted us to go everywhere in the park the lady at city hall was so very helpful showing us what we needed to do for most of the rides at it s a small world i was treated so well galaxy s edge was a hoot and we were put on a special shuttle the dancing cars were too low for my husband but i loved them food was expensive and not so hot but then again we did some other things and all in all for being handicapped we did a lot of stuff i am so glad at i got to go again ,5,2020-01-05
369,"Lots to see and do, get the Maxpass!",we have been to walt disney world many times so when we came to disneyland it was very difficult not to keep comparing everything disneyland is definitely designed for the day trip locals my teenage daughter and i did enjoy ourselves but it does take some planning to get to see and do everything they charge an extra a day per person for maxpass it is worth it if you visit during a busy time or else you will not get to ride anything without waiting hours you cannot book any fast passes until you have entered the park which is very different that wdw where you can do fast passes days out so in disneyland you wait in line for security check then wait in line to enter then rush over to a bench sit down and try to get a fast pass if you do it right you will get to ride the rides you want with minimal wait times we loved riding some of the older rides that do not exist anymore in wdw such as snow white s scary adventure and mr toad s wild ride we also got to ride haunted mansion and it s a small world with their holiday theme which was excellent disneyland still has mickeys toon town not in wdw anymore which is a very cute area for small children we are not big star wars fans but did enjoy walking through the area chewbacca was out in the crowd which was exciting to see disneyland is an easy park to navigate and the train goes the entire way around the park which can be a great reprieve for walking the one complaint we have is that there is no where in the park to recharge your phone no plugs or charging stations they sell rechargeable power banks for which i thought was too high disney wants you to use the app which is terrific for everything but then your phone needs recharging in wdw there is a charging area near the rapunzel tower and bathrooms so i just assumed disneyland would have something similar not so we ended up purchasing a power bank from cvs for and using that and speaking of the app use the mobile order for food this is fairly new to disneyland so not many are using it yet we used it the entire time and didn t wait in any lines for food yay ,5,2020-01-05
370,MaxPass Review,i consider myself one of the most devoted disney followers so it takes a lot for me to write anything less than a five star review for this park however i think something needs to be done about the trend of increased cost with no real increase the value this review is specifically about my most recent trip and the maxpass feature my wife and i went with our two year old on january a peak day we purchased maxpasses and a day park hopper tickets while it was nice after going on all of the kiddie rides that he loves to get fastpasses for some of our favorite rides indiana jones radiator springs incredicoster guardians of the galaxy it was incredibly frustrating to find out that as parents of a too short to ride person to learn that we would all have to wait in line twice for each ride in the past they have had child swap options on rides they appear to have done away with that feature it really seems to penalize our demographic of disney loving parents who want to ride rides with a disney learning kid wants to experience the park in his way even with a fastpass for each ride our year old had to spend a good minutes waiting for us at each ride if you read this and think we ll you re being selfish to make him wait for you to have your rides then okay just know that s what disneyland has designed with their current line restrictions disneyland has come along way since the entrance fee my mom was charged in now it s over a day per person i feel that the prices have officially reached the point of diminishing returns ,3,2020-01-05
371,1sr visit - loved it,was more than i could have expected definitely want to go again have also learnt the lesson of you think you know how expensive everything at disney is i was soooo wrong take worst case and double it get all your disney gears online and pick up a few special park items as mementos ,4,2020-01-05
372,Total waste of money and time,our disneyland visit was like a nightmare it was so crowded and very complicated my daughter was playing in the parade with her band so that was the highlight of the visit the parade was beautiful the rest of visit was horrible even though i d been trained by a disney pro before our trip and thought i was prepared nothing could have prepared me for this chaos we bought hopper and max passes and didn t use them at all total waste of money and time fast pass times were several hours away so we just stood in lines no picture takers were seen anywhere which would have been included in our package we even had to mobile order and wait for a dole whip it s all just too complicated and we enjoyed universal studios so much where our express passes meant something disney sent me a survey by email and they haven t even responded to my negative reviews very disappointing experience somebody said there was over k people in the park we had looked forward to this for over a year just to be ripped off and disappointed ,1,2020-01-04
373,Fantastic,everyone loves disney and it s easy to see why the park was busy but fast passes eased the queues and were very effective and worth the extra cost avoid weekends to reduce queues the rides are excellent the park is super clean and it truly is the happiest place on earth fireworks stand on the right hand side of main street facing castle back to exit for best views ,5,2020-01-04
374,"Wow wow wow, Disney at its best",love love love disneyland i have just come back from a week at disneyland over the christmas holidays including new years eve and omg busy is an understatement i have been to the park in the middle of summer holidays as well as spring break and that did nothing to prepare me for the crowds get a park hopper pass as it s nice to move between the two on the same day and absolutely buy the max pass it s per person per day but it saves you a lot of walking and gives you free access to photo pass photos taken that day you have about weeks to download the photos for free that alone makes this a total bargain i can recommend the minnie and friends character breakfast at plaza inn if you do this walk to the furtherest away entry point which is solely for character breakfast reservations this will save you time queuing to get in the gates star wars land is fantastic do the single rider for smugglers run it s a great ride i can also recommend dinner at river belle terrace the beef short ribs were bloody amazing but you ll need to book this the park does amazing christmas overlays and they are amazing it s a small world and haunted mansion these rides are better with these changes and i loved them and the decorations across the whole park are outstanding and then there s the special holiday food eg sugar plum churros alien macaron etc experiencing the christmas holiday period at disneyland is truly disney at its best ,5,2020-01-04
375,Happiest place on earth,what else can i say except if you wanna have a great fun filled family time out disneyland is the place ,5,2020-01-03
376,Fun for all ages!,thoroughly enjoyed spending christmas day at the park by a stroke of luck the crowds weren t insane so the wait times for rides weren t too bad generally though i highly recommend the disneyland park app and the digital fastpass ,5,2020-01-03
377,Avoid the holiday season,without repeating what most of the other reviews are saying do not go during holiday weekend we just queued nonstop every single thing from entrance to toilets to rides involved queues hours per ride is ridiculous also pleased we didn t bother with hopper tickets as the park closed to new guests due to reaching capacity so we wouldn t have got back into the park had we gone next door what really gets to me with queuing is the rider switch and that because our daughter was just under the height requirement age she was unable to ride a lot of main attractions many of which i think she could have but the other members of your party queue and you have to go elsewhere until they have been on the ride and then return to switch and use fastpass lane in theory this sounds good so that you re not all stuck in the line however when the place is this busy it just means you are separated from your family for hours at a time hardly enjoyable for us we much prefer universal where they allow you to queue in much shorter lines i may add together and then use the rider switch room overall we were disappointed with this park we feel that florida is much better organised ,3,2020-01-02
378,Things I wish I knew before going to Disneyland ...,top tips get the disneyland app and get comfortable using it before you go you ll need it for your maxpass if you opt to get one park hopper tickets weren t worth it for us max pass was worth it for scheduling rides downtown disney is fun and admission is free the fireworks are worth watching at least once my husband and i both in our early s took our five year old son and year old son to disneyland in may of we bought three day park hopper tickets with the max pass add on for our phones we stayed at the country inn and suites which was just a little too far for for us to walk to get to disneyland considering how much walking you do inside the park overall our disnelaynd experience was just okay it was so crowded we found ourselves only staying a few hours in the morning then leaving to go back to our hotel to swim or go to the beach my kids enjoyed the beach more than disneyland we spent a lot of money on four three day park hopper tickets and i felt like it was a waste of money we are actually going back again this year and only plan on a one day ticket to calfiornia adventure only i don t think the park hopper option is worth the money we didn t really hop back and forth between parks throughout the day the max pass option was worth the money in my opinion i think it s an extra per person and it saves a lot of time waiting in lines you can schedule your rides in advance which is a must for the popular attractions like cars and space mountain what worked out great for us was on the day disneyland opened early we hit california adventure first and raced right over to the cars ride we only had about a minutes wait which is great considering that later in the day the wait can be over minutes my husband and older son liked california adenture much more than disneyland i took my younger son and walked around the the shops and stores at disneyland when the rides were too crowded and that was a fun way to pass the time while my husband and teenager were on rides we plan on staying four days again this year and spending the majority of our time at the pool and the beach with just one disney day i will say that downtown disney is very fun and admission is free we will definitely go back there this year it s a very lively fun spot to shop and eat that s right at disneyland ,3,2020-01-02
379,New Year’s Eve 2019,my voice is hoarse from singing on top of my lungs all day into the night at disneyland we had a blast at disneyland for new year s eve the best party ever disneyland christmas parade was spectacular as always of course disneyland fireworks show is the best of them all star wars galaxy ride was cool definitely get you a maxpass if you go big game changer if you have one lots of crowd but what do you expect it s disneyland get there early enjoy ,5,2020-01-02
380,Bippoty Boppity trash,terrible prices were crazy and there were gigantic lines the amount of money spent was a fortune and way over budget my kids who are and could not stand the lines and a few times we had to get out of them and loose our spots because of the scorching sun ,1,2020-01-01
381,Extra Support Available,we took a family vacation to disneyland in the week between christmas and new years we knew that this would be a very busy time but it was the only time everyone could go so we decided to go ahead and give it a try another layer of challenge was that my youngest granddaughter was recently diagnosed with autism we didn t know what to expect as we were trying to navigate through the park with the challenges for my granddaughter a cast member noticed told us about their disability accessibility pass which made all the difference in our visit with the past you re able to get return times for rides but not have to wait in the line this was a lifesaver for us with my granddaughter all of the cast members were very kind and very helpful what started out as a huge challenge was turned into a wonderful blessing i am very grateful to the cast members in the park for helping us through this and helping us figure out how to share something that we loved with my granddaughter ,5,2020-01-01
382,Control of crowds and malfunctioning rides,i would refrain from doing dl the weekend between xmas and ny crowds are too much luckily dl close entrance to control the crowds and luckily we stayed at the grand californian i believe it was the extreme crowds for the reason the technical difficulties and the sell out of the fast pass less so early indiana jones closed as soon as we got in the fast pace line they let us use the pass in another ride radiator springs closed first thing in the morning snow white closed halfway in line to the ride all the closed rides had no estimated time of reopening so we had to bail in all the rides very frustrating this is probably unusual next time we will plan for an off peak time to go we rode more rides in the magic hour than in the rest of the day til midnight tip if you go on a busy weekend pay for the max pass and stay on property ,3,2020-01-01
383,Disneyland is in serious need of repair,this was our first and probably last time to visit disneyland we are regular disney world visitors living in florida and this park is a mess we got stuck on broken rides in one day minutes in guardians of the galaxy minutes in in indiana jones and missed new years since we were stuck on the ride now here we sit on the very next ride pirates of the caribbean and stuck for another min already this is the absolute worst experience ever as far as rides are concerned their maintenance must be in serious decline and i m in disbelief we went to the other side of the country for this experience when i can t recall a single time a ride has broken down as seriously as these in orlando very disappointing to say the least ,1,2020-01-01
384,Christmas at Disneyland,we are dvc members and typically know to steer clear of dl during high peak seasons however we made a special trip this year at christmas the rd th at dl were not to bad for crowds busy but not intolerable however that changed dramatically after christmas on the th by am dl stopped selling tickets because the park reached capacity that s people there are pinch points in the park where we literally couldn t move we actually left the park because it got scary to think what would happen with that many people if a major incident were to occur standby waits times were being posted at minutes there is absolutely no magic when the park is that busy and you can just imagine how kind and accommodating people are when they are frustrated and tired we love dl and visit often but don t recommend going during christmas ,3,2019-12-31
385,Disneyland,disneyland is one of the happiest place on earth to bring your kids four years before and my daughter visited this place and because of her height we were not able to take some of the rides this year i brought her back again as my christmas gift for her and she was extremely happy and told me that it was the best christmas gift ever we tried to take all the rides as much as we can and it was unforgetable experienced ,5,2019-12-31
386,Happiest place on earth,we love disneyland every thing has meaning and is purposefully placed and tells part of a story in disneyland it s magical for the little kids but i honestly think it gets better the older you are my favorite trips have been with teenagers ,5,2019-12-31
387,Happiest place on earth? Only if u love queuing,full disclosure we are a yr old married couple who love disney and have been to disneyworld florida disneyland paris and disney in tokyo hk we did like the parks in california however we did not love the queues it seemed like you literally queued for everything queue to get past security queue to get into the park queue to get food btw if you haven t made a restaurant reservation in advance good luck queue for the rides despite maxpass another gripe is maxpass which whilst i think is not expensive doesn t really do what it says on the tin the fact you can only get another pass mins after your current selection means that unless you arrive at the park at opening it is impossible to go on all the rides you wanted to i would also say that adventure park is only worth hours of your time and so definitely purchase a day park hopper and go to the main park first lastly do not rely on the wifi here as it is appalling kept dropping continuously on our two day visit ,3,2019-12-31
388,Queues are dreadful,a day of family fun took one a half hours to get into park after queuing from am fast passes closed by pm so you could either queue for hours for some rides or miss out otherwise the rides were great suited this mum nothing too scary teenagers preferred california adventure park with scarier rides the parade was amazing so were the fireworks but we weren t allowed to stop watch as viewing was full ridiculous sad ,4,2019-12-30
389,A big day in Disneyland,we had a great time in disneyland non stop of rides my two teenagers loving every moment of it we start our day at and didn t leave until midnight ,5,2019-12-30
390,Pleasure,so much to do and see i really felt a warm atmosphere there entry tickets were expensive though and lots of waiting in line,4,2019-12-30
391,Always a Magical place no matter your age,we love disneyland so much and decided to take our adult girls back for a visit after years since our last visit before they left home for good it does not disappoint it was still just as magical and we still got such a kick out of it again as with universal get there early to get the most out of it one of the days we were there happened to be raining and what a blessing that was it kept so many other people away we had so many easy rides with no lineups so if it s raining then absolutely go most of the lineups are undercover anyway and just a poncho will do disney never disappoints,5,2019-12-29
392,Christmas at Disneyland,we were there days between both disneyland and dca has a blast even though it rained two days we loved christmas at disney ,4,2019-12-29
393,Christmas at Disneyland!,i ve always wanted to go to disneyland at christmas it lived up to my expectations and more everything was decorated so christmas y from the huge christmas tree on main street to the christmas parade i ll remember it for a long time such a good experience ,5,2019-12-28
394,Had a great time,this was our first time to go to disneyland we have been to disney world several times and we re very pleased they definitely embrace christmas much more at disneyland we ve been to both now for christmas many of the same or very similar rides in both parks while disneyland is much smaller the christmas crowd was too we were able to ride everything we wanted most twice without any incredible waits fastpass at disneyland is much better world gives you three a day at disneyland you can get as many as you wish only one out at a time though definitely a great day ,5,2019-12-28
395,"Lines, Lines, Lines",a must do attraction but losing appeal due to overcrowding which makes most rides not accessible after about am wait times quickly soar to minutes or more take food and drink park prices are extortionate not much for small kids and what there is overrun by big kids should be max height and max age requirement to leave a little something for toddlers ,3,2019-12-28
396,Disney-hype,understanding that people will still go i would temper expectations we arrived at am then spent hours in line to get in then another minutes to get tix then they closed disneyland b c it was at capacity so we spent hours in another park we never wanted to see before we could go to disneyland bought fast pass which allows you to reserve a spot in line for rides time every minutes however rides for free pass fill up and will be gone ours were by so we got ride for for one day wait times were generally minutes depending on ride in all rides for the day signage was a joke as it s nonexistent and organizationally they re challenged one and only visit especially for per adult years old guess they need to still pay for star wars and marvel franchises ,1,2019-12-28
397,Go for the new Star Wars Park!,galaxy s edge the new star wars park is themed to perfection the millennium falcon ride was a dream come true the cantina had me smiling the entire time the entire experience is wonderful ,5,2019-12-28
398,Great location but getting expensive.,great location to bring the kids with plenty to see and do this was my th visit and i noticed this time that prices have gone up food options are pretty average in quality with small portion sizes ,4,2019-12-27
399,Happiest Place on Earth,love love love that s all i can say it was my th visit to disneyland resort and the wonderment still amazes me my daughter was fortunate enough to dance in the christmas main street parade we were the from dec and had a day hopper pass the first few days it was busy with wait times exceeding an hour for some rides still can t believe the line to get a churro maybe they need to include the churro stalls in the fast pass system as always the park was immaculately kept the staff were absolutely amazing and the atmosphere is always magical our last disney experience was to walt disney world i really liked their fast pass system and magic band process maybe disneyland california adventure need to adopt a similar system i love that you can still take water in and that there are places to refill your drink bottles i also love that you can take snacks in which help pass the time in long ride queues definitely family friendly overall disneyland never disappoints whether it s super busy or not so busy it still holds its title for me as the happiest place on earth ,5,2019-12-27
400,Star Wars theme park is the best,disney theme parks in general are what they are and either you long forthem or absolutely hate them but the star wars land that was created is an absolute must see the entire area recreated truly looks feels and sounds like a different planet with amazing attention to detail the smuggler run ride is amazing and olgas cantina is a fun experience expensinve to build your own droid and light saber but overall fun experiences ,5,2019-12-27
401,Disneyland Park,a great place to visit be prepared to line up for quite a while to get on the rides unless you use fast pass or go on the single rider sections a must place to visit if you re in california ,5,2019-12-27
402,If you hate lines don't go here,there is a line for security there is a line to get in there is a line for the rides lines to eat food airlines to take pictures a famous areas and characters there are lines to get into lines and massive crowds to see the parade the only thing that does not have a line are the shows i would recommend using fastpass but after about p m the next fastpass is around p m if you can go during a weekday i highly recommend it ,4,2019-12-26
403,Waste of money,expected more from disneyland was very disappointed with the we the maxpass works because it doesn t work there are areas in the park where you have no cell phone signal there are issues if you buy it later than in the morning and overall just a waste of money,1,2019-12-26
404,Great place,great place with great service staff go above and beyond to make people comfortable and happy best experience for the entire family ,5,2019-12-24
405,Fun for all ages!,it had been years since our last visit but our first time when it was decorated for christmas we were here for two days which was close to enough time as disneyland is nowhere near the size of disney world the decorations were amazing there was a pretty good crowd there as it was the first weekend in december ,5,2019-12-23
406,Fantastic first visit,staying in one of the hotels inside the area makes a difference it allows you to enjoy the parks more and helps when you want to rest for a while,5,2019-12-22
407,"62 MALE SOLE TRAVELER, had the time of my life",it was great lots of places to sit if you need to rest everyone had a smile everyone was so nice i highly recommend for solo or family,5,2019-12-22
408,Disney fun not matter your age,arrive at park min prior to opening and head straight to star wars galaxy s edge you will be able to get on the ride within min immediately after ride go to single line and you can ride immediately these lines get longer as the day goes on the single line will get long too make reservations for olga cantina immediately because it fills up dinner reservations across the parks fill up quickly too the maxpass is worth the extra this is a magical place no matter your age everyone happy love disney and the characters walking around ,5,2019-12-21
409,Always kept nice and the food/service is consistently great,everything is top notch whats not to like parks are clean food is great and the rides are exceptional ,5,2019-12-21
410,Star Wars vs Mickey Mouse and more tips for the trip.,in a day age when they are cranking out more star wars movies than mickey mouse cartoons most of the people wearing mickey mouse ears also have star wars t shirts with their favorite characters as for the people there are alot of them welcome to the land of get in line to be herded thru a crowd to get in another line why is this place so busy is because the disney park has so much cool stuff to experience if you have kids and are going on rides pay extra for that fastpass the ride wait times can be hours long while the fastpass holders go to the front get a park map this place is big and it s easy to get lost there are many different themed sections that each offer something unique to enjoy a map will help you find them some of my favorites was a relaxing mark twain river boat ride great for adults and lines were easy in the middle was a fun pirate island great for kids to run around and they limit how many people are on the island so it was somewhat quiet and easy so you won t lose your kids while they are having fun everyone knows all about the galaxy edge area which is totally awesome beware the storm troopers are rude best place for pictures of darth vader and chewbacca go to the star wars launch bay not in the galaxy edge area its closer to the main entrance for those thinking about photo pass know that when we went to get our pictures with mickey mouse in toontown and darth vader they have someone there to take your pictures with your camera at both locations things to bring extra phone battery charger you will not find any where to plug in and your phone will go dead because you re using it to take all those cool pictures and videos don t bring your selfie stick the security at entry checkpoint will make you take it back to your car there will be alot of walking standing in lines etc if you are with someone elderly that can t be on their feet all day you can rent electric scooters hope this information helps some people the disney park is a great place worth making the trip have fun ,4,2019-12-21
411,Disneyland Park & CA Adventure Park,just went on a day park hopper pass to both these places i have been several times over the years but have to say it s getting harder to enjoy the visit they don t seem to regulate how many people can get into the park anymore and with all the strollers people and electronic chairs it s like the entire place is one big line to get anywhere i did not go during the height of a vacation week we went when most kids are still in school in early dec we used fast passes but seemed to spend most of our time running back and forthe to the fastpass areas to get ride times and then meeting our time slot it seemed ot me in the past they would limit the number of people inside the park and i can t imagine if there were an emergency you could get everyone out of the park quickly there is only one entrance and you have to be talking about hundred of thousands of people i just did not enjoy the experience with that many people i was told this was normal and there really is no slow time anymore it s much worse during summer and during the holiday weeks if that s the case i can t imagine going during that time i had a very difficult time getting through the crowds to see fireworks parades light show without setting up hours in advance what s the point in that you only have so many days there so to spend hours setting up to see each event plus ride time it s ridiculous disappointed for the money spent i felt like i was in commute traffic within the disneyparks and had a hard time getting that happiest place on earth feeling while being pushed and jostled by inconsiderate visitors with strollers i had one too electronic chairs and just large groups moving about the park or stopping in the middle of a walkway to discuss who s going to get the next fast pass group you have to buy at least a day pass to get to see the entire place and even that wasn t enough we got there by am each day and didnt leave till closing and still between crowds and lines did not get to see all of disneyland nor get to eat in many of the actual resturants as lines were way too long just not enjoyable anymore i d hate to spend the money to fly to orlando to find the same thing there at least we were able to drive although it was a hour drive the only way to improve the experience is to limit the crowds and i don t see that happening whatever you do don t go during any of the peak season times if this is off peak i can t imagine trying to do this in the summer or during a holiday break ,2,2019-12-20
412,California Resort at Disney Land,this was our every two years visit to disneyland in anaheim ca we stayed at the grand californian resort days nights the property was very good we had a balcony room over looking downtown disney as you could imagine a lot of happenings every day this property has multiple pools and eating establishments within the hotel itself during this time of season there are a lot of activities for both adults and children within the property itself there s probably been lots of reviews of this property but our first time and it met our expectations staff were very helpful and friendly leticia our maid was absolutely priceless derrick dennis were also very helpful and friendly don t expect any perks this is definitely a pay for everything place to include parking no validation here at least for our package rooms were nice but nothing in the wow factor and we have stayed luxurious establishments before and were given courtesy perks just due to price paid i assume there are packages were this nice duties are included i would assume but overall we will be returning ,4,2019-12-19
413,It Is Simply The Best!,the details the rides the food the disney name it is all clearly a cut above anything else guaranteed of course it s going to cost that s what happens when you attend the best here s the reality if you really want the ultimate disney experience visit the park during the non peak times you will then have the opportunity to indulge yourself in everything that disneyland has to offer if you insist on traveling there during peak season especially with small children be prepared to have your anxiety levels go through the roof the park customer service representatives are more than willing to offer you the best off season dates to visit but if you have to go there during the holidays or the summer i wish you lots of luck or a stiff drink ,5,2019-12-18
414,Ten out of Ten,kids rated out of a three day park hopper multipass note do get a hopper pass for at least two days this gives you access to both parks including california adventure park which is directly opposite the disney park and has more thrill rides especially important for older kids best rides incredicoaster guardian of galaxy radiator spring all in california adventure park with star wars galaxy edge amazing in disney park including the ride good eats between the parks in downtown disney shopping strip ,5,2019-12-18
415,First visit: fell in love with the classics,i m a frequent visitor to disney world in orlando but had never been to disneyland before it was so much fun i loved the classic rides small world a million times better than the one in florida at least during christmastime mr toad s wild ride spinning beers snow white and of course peter pan the lines could get pretty long but i found that even on busy days there was always something to do loved my time at disneyland ,5,2019-12-17
416,Not the same,disney service is going downhill the prices are ridiculous they re cutting services out that they used to offer they re too busy they re not using the same standards they used to it s obvious the service is getting dusty along with the decor too bad ,4,2019-12-16
417,Disneyland Resort and Hotel,what can you say about disneyland that most everyone already isn t aware of for two years in a row we have gone back to disneyland after an absence of about years it never fails to thrill everyone being in the park and seeing as much as humanly possible in your time there we stayed at the disneyland hotel these last two years and it really adds to the experience not having to trek across from the motels on the outskirts of the park to enter the park and i must say having the ability to get in the park early because we stayed at the disneyland hotel was very helpful as we drove from so far and getting the jump on the days there let us see more it doesn t matter how old you are disneyland is still the happiest place on earth ,5,2019-12-16
418,SO magical for christmas time,absolutely love disneyland at christmas time so magical with all the christmas decorations and all the characters dressed up for christmas time the show of color at california adventure was amazing,5,2019-12-16
419,Trip to Disneyland,fairly quick to get through ebtrance and park hop apart from the friday when a lot of new families seemed to be arriving needed more gates open christmas parade is sweet watch out for the dancing reindeer queues for rides were reasonable with fast passes available for most during the first part of the day shows and food outlets all around the park alcohol appears to be more expensive in california good to spend days exploring,4,2019-12-16
420,Disneyland parks,couldn t find disneyland parks to make a review maybe that s intentional from disney if you hate to wait in lines disney is not for you you have to wait in line for at least minutes for security and then another to minutes to get into the park and disney is packed with people if you don t have a fastpass you could wait in line for almost an hour then if you want to see a character that could be a to minute wait additionally the food is overpriced and if you want to try to eat at a place for dinner good luck there are many things to do at disneyland but everything is a wait including taking pictures are the simplest things recommend going on a weekday to avoid the heavy crowds ,3,2019-12-16
421,The worst customer experience online purchase,i tried to make a simple online purchase of tickets to disneyland i ll make the story short though it was over hours online and on phone and still hadn t resolved all my attempts to but tickets online failed app website all failed multiple times as i called customer service i discovered that they literally can s help they can t help purchase online this is disney they weren t also able to solve it in any other way except me standing in line at the gates to the park i was not about to do that and suggested i purchase gift tickets online and use them to buy the online tickets long story short i did it and the situation only gotten worse as the giftcard website didn t allow me to log in i couldn t manage my orders and get the number to use for the online tickets another hour on the phone with a disney customer service rep didn t lead to anything literally the worst customer experience i had in years and still not resolved they don t know how to help us it s crazy ,1,2019-12-14
422,Awesome!,the best disneyland we have been too they do it better than the other disneys around the world awesome atmosphere and friendly staff all around the park ,5,2019-12-13
423,First Return Visit as Seniors - The Positives and Negatives,it s been years since we visited disneyworld at christmas and even longer since our visit to disneyland california adventure we spent several months prior to our visit researching and reviewing different disney websites watching you tube videos and reading several guidebooks we had a day parkhopper with maxpass and went sunday through wednesday after thanksgiving weekend overall we had a great time but we did experience a different park as seniors early s both parks seemed extremely crowded from noon onwards even on the or crowd level days maybe some of this is due to annual passes and or the new galaxy s edge we found main street the parade areas and the shops almost impossible to navigate with the mobs of people strollers and motorized scooters i know the scooters need to be allowed inside the shops but i think the parks should ban the strollers from shops as recommended everywhere we arrived at least minutes before the park opening time and got through the security line and were at the front of the entrance lines we did our first maxpass once inside the park a big time saver also the am early morning day was wonderful and we were able to do rides by mid morning maxpass was great and saved us a lot of time and walking definitely worth the extra cost very easy to use if you use a bulky cell phone case it will need to come off in order to scan the cell phone at the fastpass entry places no surprise as seniors we found it more difficult climbing into and out of many rides along with the lack of knee room on many welcome to old age the ride operators were very good about allowing extra time and or a helping hand when needed thank you and our bodies felt the after effects of being tossed around and jostled on many of the rides bring some ben gay in your luggage i don t think we could have survived another day we enjoyed all of the thrill rides but as seniors we especially enjoyed slowing down and noticing the many little details around the park and inside the tamer attractions we found the majority of the cast members especially the store clerks very friendly and gracious in spite of the many difficult folks they were handling that said we did notice quite a few cast members who seemed tired and unhappy and looked like they were just trying to make it through their day we understood and knew how they felt we felt it too just trying to maneuver the endless mobs of people strollers scooters and cranky children everywhere we went it takes a really special type of person to handle this day in and out i was wearing headband ears and on indiana jones i removed them and put them through my backpack strap and was also holding on to them however somewhere during the ride they were ripped away and when the ride ended they were nowhere to be found not expensive and no big loss but on our next day when riding again i told a cast member about it while in line he said to go to the lost found and sure enough they had them an unexpected happy ending food and drinks were somewhat pricey as we expected but all were prepared well and quite tasty no regrets on anything disney does a great job and we thank the many disneyland cast members who made our visit special and enjoyable under sometimes challenging times we hope to return again soon ,4,2019-12-13
424,"Even when it's bad, it's good.",but i have to admit it wasn t the magical place i remembered from a few decades ago and to be fair it was raining all day thanksgiving day so most of it was viewed through the opening in a rain poncho it was still very crowded in spite of the weather lines were long and standing in the rain just wasn t enjoyable there were a couple of rides we abandoned our place in line because of the long waits pirates of the caribbean remains a favorite we rode the monorail into the park which put us back into tomorrowland as a park entry which i regret because we didn t get the main street entry and that whole magical transformation staff was different that i remember as well staff walked in front of us without greeting or apology i remember when they used to make you feel truly like a valued guest i didn t feet that this time and again it was raining so it was different for everyone ,4,2019-12-13
425,"What can I tell you,its Disneyland",there is a lot here crammed into a small footprint if you look at the park from above its quite small i see some people with one or two year olds dont wast your time wait until they hit at least six for the big fun oh wait its not the kids you are there for they are just along for the ride,4,2019-12-13
426,Just GO!!,i always get the multiple day flex pass so i m not limited on moving from park to park you can see what you like from each park and decide what you want to do from minute to minute the attention to detail in every aspect of disneyland is really something to experience ,5,2019-12-13
427,Nobody does it like Disney!,my husband and i recently visited disneyland with our adult son and his twin boys it was wonderful to watch our grandsons experience the disney magic for the very first time ,5,2019-12-12
428,Skip this place and go to Florida,i m an avid disney traveler traveling not only to disney theme parks but various properties as well disneyland is sorely lacking in a number of things it is cool to see the iconic castle and it s a small world the haunted mansion and ride the railroad galaxy s edge is also great the attention to detail and how they made it feel is a must for a star wars fan but go to galaxy s edge in florida in fact just go to the disney parks in florida paris or tokyo don t go to california first the park is small you can see it all in a half a day easily there are some parts that are clearly dated and need a little tlc disney usually does really well at making dated rides and attractions still look nice disneyland fails in this department disney staff now this is big for me i sympathize and empathize with the staff at properties i know what they put up with and i go out of my way to make sure i m not that guest who makes their day miserable usually i can end up having a decent chat or something memorable at disneyland everyone was just mad they all acted like they d rather be anywhere else one female employee got a bit upset with me i know she didn t understand me and it was a miscommunication i didn t feel the need to complain about it i think she was just having a bad day but i think all the other employees were too the holiday decorations this does not live up to the hype not when you have seen the decorations in florida sure they were pretty and festive but they were not at all what they were made out to be but the candy cane beignets those lived up to the hype so good the churros that everyone told me to get they were good but what is the big deal they are just a good churro all in all i was horribly disappointed with the size cleanliness and atmosphere of disneyland skip this park go to another disney park instead this was a complete waste of money for us and i only wish we didn t spend the cash on the tickets ,2,2019-12-10
429,Don't Bother - worst experience everrrr,unfriendly staff who were either rude and abrupt or didn t have a clue with how to assist with our issue unfortunately there weren t many characters out because of the weather was a little cold and wet thts ok we only spent us pp day to visit when we did see a few of the characters they weren t interested in interacting with the kids or taking photos unless we showed them the money the toilets were disgusting no decor just public toilets paid for standard pizzas for us and tht doesn t include drinks i could go on but i really can t be bothered reliving the stressful day so if you want to take your family for the sake of it being disneyland then i suggest go with a full wallet and lots of knowledge of how to use the fast pass along with a map of the park so that you won t have to ask any of the staff their for help universal studios was soooooo much better less expensive and wayyyy less stressful ,1,2019-12-10
430,What a ripper!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!,we had two a day pass i have visited this park over years ago i can reassure you it meet my expectations and more congrats staff and all keep up the good work ,5,2019-12-10
431,Happiest place on earth- 💯,stayed in hotel within walking distance to main park and ca adventure park spent days one day each park grandsons birthday celebration and family vacation super fun and year old went on almost every ride as well as his year old cousin year old did more rides in ca adventure they all had fun as we did too expensive weekend but worth the cost always clean and helpful staff lines not too shabby for a saturday and sunday weather perfect hotel was great pricey though howard johnson s was the place it had a small water park for kids at it ,5,2019-12-10
432,Always magical,went to enjoy the magic kingdom dressed up for the holidays many of the same traditional sites as well as new themes ,5,2019-12-10
433,"long lines, too many people",what a colossal disappointment disneyland was overcrowded which caused long lines and completely ruined my experience i will never go back what a ripoff ,1,2019-12-09
434,Still a great time for all.,our second time this time we did november so we could see the christmas shows and decorations we loved it especially at night as it looks magical when it s lit up we took it easy this time wandering in and out during the days we use single rider whenever possible it gets you through faster ready for the next one just remember it s the same ride even if you aren t sitting beside your bestie sibling partner sometimes people complain about the prices of the food but you can see it before you go so plan to bring a sandwich or fruit if you don t want to pay too much this isn t exclusive to the disney parks or share meals no one minds and they are enough for two usually the park overall is great even wandering from land to land when it gets too busy for a fastpass or the single rider lines get stopped is fun read the t shirts so many to see enjoy the live shows the light shows and fireworks at night watch the mark twain paddle past on the rivers of america you don t have to do ride after ride to enjoy it all this is my own third time at the parks and i have loved every time ,5,2019-12-08
435,Never Disappoints,i can t say anything negative disneyland always meets my expectations i can t help but smile from ear to ear while i am there it reminds me of so many happy times ,5,2019-12-07
436,Look for the singles line in popular rides,the singles line is often a bit hidden look for it often a couple can get on the same ride together in much less time than in the standby line also it s a good time to do the water rides in the cooler weather as there will be less people ,4,2019-12-05
437,Always a great time,had a great days at the parks hopper is the way to go maxipass is the way to go for mobile fast pass game changer for mobile food pick up lines weren t too bad go early and stay late ,5,2019-12-03
438,First time visiting,really enjoyed my first visit to disneyland from australia was very busy as we visited around thanksgiving we were able to do the park in two days but missed many rides as it was raining and many had to be closed food was enjoyable and a friend that is gluten intolerant was provided for with no worries fireworks were amazing best i have ever seen ,5,2019-12-03
439,Love Disneyland,who doesn t love a good family trip to disneyland this si the first time i came for halloween and it was a blast love all the added halloween decorations is it expensive of course it is do i whish it was less expensive of course but is that going to stop me form going no which is why they keep the prices high ,4,2019-12-02
440,My new favorite place to visit!,i visited here for the first time i like it here much more than disneyworld in orlando they re both wonderful but here in disneyland you can get much more done i was able to meet lots of characters i got some rides done too but to me the maxpass wasn t worth it because of the high crowd levels because of the popularity halloween season the maxpasses would run out for certain rides so i was only able to use it for photopass unfortunately i love how to characters roam there are so many to meet around the park the rides are so much fun it s wonderful for all ages i m i also visited the oogie boogie bash which was wonderful also i would reccomend bringing your own portable charger like i did because disneyland charges for the fuel rods i believe it s another to get a new rod ,4,2019-12-02
441,Kicked around by Disney staff,first time to disney with the kids negative experience with disney staff i can t believe they treat anyone this way let alone first timers tried to watch the disney band before the parade but staff kept telling us to move no staff member could be bothered to tell us where we should be they just kept telling us we couldn t be where we were there were white ropes up and we were always on the sidewalk side of that not the street side after being told for the rd time we d moved to a different spot at their request each time i complained literally pointed to the first time badge and got a little guidance by this time my family was done with being pushed around we never got to see the parade we just went back to the hotel the kids were discouraged thus is supposed to be a fun place we re booked in for days i hope the rest isn t going to be like this ,1,2019-12-01
442,Always a fun day.,what can i say about disneyland amazing so beautiful with the christmas decorations use fast pass well worth the money ,5,2019-12-01
443,Fun Thanksgiving Week!,we brought our nine year old for his first visit that he s old enough to remember during thanksgiving week he was obsessed with star wars galaxy s edge and the memories of building his custom lightsaber will last a lifetime maxpass is definitely worth the extra fee being able to book fast passes on your phone instead of zigzagging all over the park is a huge benefit even with the holiday crowds we experienced everything on our must do list plus a few extras we love our time at disney parks and this was no exception ,5,2019-11-30
444,Fun Trip,we visited dl for three days one day was cold and rainy do not ride the ferris wheel when cold and rainy bad idea lines were not too bad but we had max pass star wars land was amazing the ride smugglers rub was a little under whelming we had a good time ,5,2019-11-30
445,Its out of control,we took our year old son to disneyland park on a day visit for his birthday it was a first time visit for all of us and we were impressed so upgraded to annual pass on our next day visit during thanksgiving week it was mayhem the place was packed to the limit the staff stressed and rude couple of them seemed to be profiling us racially especially at the security check and entrance gate in some shows like turtle talk and dance party they seem to have a strong preference for certain type of kids if you know what i mean my child loves turtle talk we probably been there times not even once my child or any other non caucasian child got to interact with crush same for dance party where the kids with whom the dj s interact are of certain type it was also striking the lack of diversity in employees i think it is probably matched to the type of crowd that visits which is overwhelmingly of certain type makes sense that staff needs to mirror the clientele but to us we did feel out of place also i couldn t find an answer for why there is such a lack of diversity in visitor types is it a well known thing that disneyland park is only for certain type of people i am not sure having max pass and some planning meant we could access the popular rides without long waits but i could not figure out why so many year olds wait in line for mins for a minute peter pan ride disneyland is out of control we will not be renewing the annual pass ,3,2019-11-30
446,The happiest place on earth:),we just love it the best place to go with kids all the employees nice and smiling everyone willing to help you nice food everywhere clean restrooms even on a busy day great shopping ,5,2019-11-29
447,Amazing Trip,st time to disneyland it was a magical mom and daughter trip we really enjoyed ourselves and had so much fun there were things we got to do that disney world didn t have would love to go back in the future ,5,2019-11-29
448,Nostalgic and fun,my husband and i visited disney yesterday even with fast max we only were able to ride on hyperspace mountain and big thunder railroad i had a blast dinging pluto he was such a gentlemen posing for photos with me he even got my husband involved the weather was great many of the rides were for younger patrons it s a little less spread out than disney world ,4,2019-11-26
449,Fun,great place to experience if you get the chance the line ups are incredibly long at times but a great must do experience for families the fun vibe around the place is awesome maxi fast pass is worth it on busy days ,4,2019-11-26
450,Seemed under staffed,we found the park to be under staffed this visit there didnt seem to be as many characters this time overall the cast members seemed rather grumpy and that was disappointing we will stick to disney world ,4,2019-11-26
451,Over priced,this is probably the th time we visited disneyland and it always lives up to the hype every single time my daughter absolutely loves disneyland she just loves it,2,2019-11-26
452,Love it,recently visited with friends who had not been before we could be described as senior citizens and the day pass was excellent value the new star wars attraction should not be missed whilst i have been there many times disneyland is always great entertainment we had a fantasmic dining experience in the blue bayou restaurant with special reserve seating to the show that was a highlight of our visit ,5,2019-11-26
453,Never ceases to entertain,loved disneyland very organized friendly staff get the maxpass if you want to go on the big popular rides ,5,2019-11-25
454,Can't go wrong,disney is amazing great rides lovely place great fun for all the family y o girl y o boy and mum and dad ,5,2019-11-25
455,Amazing (as you would expect!),this was my first time visiting but have been to disney world over times since we live on the east coast definitely utilized the maxpass to the fullest i still prefer the magic bands vs using my phone all day to scan my passes of us were using my charger and our phones were almost out of juice by the end of the day i had to shut my phone off several times to save the battery for the maxpasses i loved the holiday decor preferred the pirates ride hyperspace mountain haunted mansion vs disney world wish we would have had a second day here but we tried to cram as much in as possible the highlight of our trip revolved around my granddaughter who is almost she adores chewbacca dressed as him for halloween we brought her costume with us to see if we could have her meet chewy my son in law spoke to a cast member asking when chewy would be available she arranged it that chewy spent over minutes with my granddaughter he took her by the hand since they were getting away from the stormtroopers he then had her help fix a communications tower it was the most amazing experience ever ,5,2019-11-24
456,Loved this park,i am not an amusement park fan because i don t like crowds there are numerous rules there a lot of rules here and now i know why this keeps structure and prevents chaos and for that they should be commended we got the fast pass and would never go without i feel like you should do a lot of research about show times and how the pass works to better coordinate your day the first day we ran from one side of the park to the other second day was much better lots of hotels have shuttles to here do research on hotels too even the cheaper hotel brands seem to cater to the visitors going to disney they do a fantastic creative job on the rides making them enjoyable for everyone and brings back your inner child no matter how old you are if you are claustrophobic do not go on the finding nemo submarine ride not missing much my least fav i do like the fact that you can pack food and drinks i think they could find a better way of marking the park with signs relying on the map is quite a pain i even thought california adventure was marked better some bathrooms are less busy and cleaner than others for whatever reason note to self go to bathroom before heading to fireworks once they start getting situated some restrooms get closed off as kids typically are my granddaughter had to go suddenly really bad there was a close restroom easy peezy right no it was closed and when asked was told another one just down the way but was not just down the way not being well marked didn t help either waited mins for a good spot to see them and because of this only saw the last minute of them one ride had technical difficulties while we were on it and had to wait even the slushee machine was having difficulties and told to come back would try and see a character and by the time you spot it they were done and moving to another location soon all in all the park is nice but feel like we spent a lot of time waiting and moving on the positive side i definitely walked off what i ate lastly be patient and if you are in a group it might be easier to break off and set up a meeting time the in between times sit relax and watch the children smile and take in all the creative decorations it s gonna be a long day ,5,2019-11-24
457,Can’t get enough,my third visit to this park over a number of years and i can t get enough perfect for all ages there are lockers for storage at the front of the park plenty of stroller parking sizeable clean rest rooms with baby change facilities heaps of seating for eating in or take out or even just to rest your feet drink fountains scattered throughout the park also my recommendation if you have days is grab a park hopper pass which includes entry to california adventure and utilise the fast pass system and single rider lines to get the most out of the rides and wait times this was my first visit using the disney app which gives live updates on wait times so you can really plan your execution of the park you can also make restaurant reservations or order from your phone to skip the queue for pick up we found wait times were not always completely accurate but we visited on a tuesday wed when the park is quieter than a weekend and the longest we waited was for mins on the matterhorn if you have longer than days consider going into the park at lunchtime and staying til close heaps to see and do at night as well park is open til midnight in summer or pm otherwise this is a must do if you love disney theme parks avoiding being an adult ,5,2019-11-23
458,Disneyland,we had a great time on our visit we used the fast pass for the popular rides it s just too darn expensive ,5,2019-11-21
459,First visit on my 60th!,we had fabulous days at disneyland and one day at california adventure the experience was great but it s so busy here anytime after midday and the crowds are large and the wait times get long just walking around the park can be tough strollers everywhere and people bashing into you one of the days at disney land was a saturday and it was extra crowded washrooms can be difficult to find we did manage to do and redo all our favorite rides food and drinks were fairly expensive especially when we translate it to cdn photo ops and souvenirs are another cash grab you need to budget for there is a price for everything just be aware and i would advise not booking fast passes until later in case as well the early morning pass at cali adventure is only for disney hotel guests ,4,2019-11-21
460,Back again after Nine years,decided o take advantage of our ten night stay in cancun and pick up five days to visit disney and undertake some shopping i must say that in comparison to visiting disney in florida last november this one is clearly better we purchased a hopper pass for this park we ended up getting around the park in a day as there was clear advantage for us being there before i guess the most disappointing thing was that there were four rides broken down yep these things happen i guess not much different from nine years ago,3,2019-11-21
461,Happiest place on earth,so many rides everything is beautiful a lot of rides for all ages ton of restaurants to eat at with different options and different prices to meet everyone s needs all very good staff is very helpful blanca and kelly are two staff members we remember and they were very nice ,5,2019-11-19
462,Galaxys Edge,we went in the off season and couldn t have picked a better time to go the park was never overly crowded even in the new star wars park which was our main reason for going we definitely used our maxpass purchase too,4,2019-11-19
463,Off Season is the Way to Go,we hit the park as soon as the convention ended on a friday afternoon this was my first time at the original disney park and i was not disappointed food at the restaurants was very good and service was excellent the new star wars galaxy edge was fantastic and the minute wait in line for the millennium falcon ride passed by quickly the christmas parade was very well done and the fireworks was typical well done disney had a great time ,5,2019-11-18
464,Happiest Place on Earth,feels like i am in one of the star wars movie while walking in this area i see stormtrooper walking around it was so much fun ,5,2019-11-18
465,New Star Wars park,our granddaughters first trip to disneyland resort in california their ages are and perfect ages to do rides and all the walking without much trouble each of them had favorite rides using the maxpass fastpass is great for photos plus the lineups and i highly recommend it if you want the photos churros and dole whip were on my own list to have and both were delicious the california adventure park was great for all of us too my favorite ride was radiator springs race cars if you do any of the water rides in either park be prepared to have wet shoes and feet bringing a change of footwear was the best for me it was warm enough weather that our clothes dried during the day ,5,2019-11-17
466,Family vacation,had a great time enjoying the holiday themed trip try all the holiday treats available it s a bid crowded so don t rush,5,2019-11-16
467,Disney visit,the happiest place on earth sums it up visited with my mother in law who has some mobility issues and she had no problems ,5,2019-11-16
468,Disney slides backwards to mediocrity,its been years since we ere last here we found it extremely crowded and no it wasn t holiday time ,1,2019-11-15
469,Very crowded,we had such a good time at disneyland with the new disney app you can get your fast pass which is so much better than the old way ordering food also great see wait times get photos awesome etc but there is a big problem with it the wifi in the park is really bad if you are an american you probably have data but for anyone visiting from another country you are forced to buy a data package with your cell phone provider that can be very pricey as a canadian visiting the park we had to get a data package for each day we were there luckily a friend who had recently visited gave us the heads up once you have it the app is amazing however i think if the park is heading toward using digital media for guests they should upgrade the wifi in the park to something that can better handle the volume of people who need to use it ,3,2019-11-13
470,A trip worth saving for,we have been a few times in the last years and it is still fun the new star wars land is worth the visit alone the rides are still great although we felt the haunted house was more fun with the original characters not sure if it just set up for halloween at the moment still a fun place although very busy ,5,2019-11-13
471,To use the app you need data on your phone,it was my first time visiting and it was incredible stars wars stuck out for me the setting is phenomenal at a night time when the sound of an x wing comes on you genuinely look up expecting to see one fly past that s how realistic it is the new ride is wicked a nice simulator where there are roles so you all have your part to play queues aren t very long at all and because you re constantly moving you don t know how long you re waiting haunted mansion is perfect such an amazing experience it s dead clean no litter anywhere the performers are fantastic make sure you see fantasmic beware strollers and electric mobility scooters they will go over your toes and you won t get any apology ,4,2019-11-12
472,So much fun for all ages,expectations were high for this ride but i am glad i did single rider line which was quick and we got to ride together however it was as engineers and not as pilots if you followed direction you would spend all your time looking and pushing buttons lame graphics were not as good as star tours and nowhere near the quality of the avatar ride at disney world my recommendation is to wait for the completion of this area and the feature ride to be completed the rest of the parks were great as expected especially the transformation of the haunted mansion for xmas ,5,2019-11-12
473,You must visit Star Wars Galaxy's Edge,the parks and downtown disney were amazing the decorations are breathtaking maybe even more so than in years past the grand does not have its tree up as of yet but the gingerbread replica of the grand is built and stunning the holiday fireworks end with a snowfall on main street it felt surreal standing for about minutes in the christmas scented snow couples everywhere were embracing the most sought after item is the light up christmas tree popcorn bucket i attempted to get this several times but the lines wore me down the spirit of the people in the lines for these buckets felt kindred to a wal matt black friday in further news november will be the first day of the candy cane offering i am unsure of the price this year if you are able to get in line at at the candy store and get the bracelet you will be allowed to purchase the candy cane later that day one per person folks ,5,2019-11-12
474,Really is the happiest place on Earth,no matter what your age you can run around like a kid and have a ball the churros and frozen lemonade are delicious thunder mountain and splash mountain are my favorite rides plus around halloween and the holidays the park is even more decorated ,5,2019-11-10
475,Loved my Disneyland adventure,its great crowded yes but not as daunting as i thought it would be everything is very well organised and there are plenty of helpful staff and cats members take advantage of the quick ticketting system for ride called fast pass just for those popular rides i found the lines moved quickly but with the fast pass i could make best use of time and look at other attractions download the disney app so you know how long the wait to each ride is and if a ride is not operating youll know when it starts up again wear comfy shoes take a hat sunscream and a water bottle for your personal comfort throughout the day one thing i found was there is not many places to sit down unless you are in a restaurant so if you have trouble walking or standing for long times it can be a challenge ,5,2019-11-09
476,Over crowded and very average food,we choose to visit disneyland at the end of october to experience halloween and try to catch christmas as well all the information told us after halloween it wouldn t be busy but for me it was crowded which didn t make the experience pleasant the food was average with all the family experiencing an upset stomach and my daughter ending up in the local er department ,3,2019-11-09
477,They went all out for our Halloween trip! Loved Oogie Boogie!,you can t go wrong with disney anything the park is always super clean food is a bit pricey but hey it s disneyland and california but i will say the food we had was very good despite the price we went to the oogie boogie night at the california adventure and it was truly excellent would highly recommend ,5,2019-11-09
478,Great experience,went there to be a kid for the day found the crowds to be a little overwhelming queues for ridiculously long not much seating available to just sit and take in the happenings ,4,2019-11-09
479,First time here but not the last!,my family came to california to celebrate my graduation and we brought my niece as well who is handicapped this was all of our first time and it was amazing my niece got to see her favorite princess cinderella and she acknowledged her in the parade and remembered her when we did the meet and greet and escorted her to meet ariel the entire staff accommodated both my niece and my mom who are handicapped by pausing the onboarding and off loading processes for the rides as well as having a good spot to watch fantasmic all in all a wonderful experience that my family can t wait to come back and experience again ,5,2019-11-08
480,Amazing Memories,i took my family here for a weekend we had the time of our lives the kids loved it i loved it everyone loved it lines were a tad bit long but the fun was worth the wait we created memories for a lifetime ,5,2019-11-07
481,Really is the happiest place on earth,family trip that lived up to the expectations the park itself is amazing rides for all ages the staff always smile and super helpful the characters are amazing and put smile on so many faces starwars area was unbelievable the shows they put on and engaging with the audience was awesome not a huge disney fan but can see why it s the happiest place on earth being australian has no idea was stroller parking was genius highly recommend for all ages ,5,2019-11-07
482,"Love Disneyland, hate the crowds!",i love disney and disneyland it has definitely gotten way more crowded with every passing year max passes are your friend and so worth the extra money the max passes allowed us to go on the highly popular rides with little and sometimes rarely no wait if you have a multiple day park hopper ticket or are staying at a disney hotel take advantage of the magic mornings they make all the difference we were able to ride indiana pirates haunted mansion and thunder railroad all in minutes with no line wait time as soon as the park opened the wait time for the haunted mansion jumped to minutes granted it was halloween i love the parks at the holidays i just wish they were a little less crowded the crowd is the lowest earlier in the morning am i love disneyland and will go back many times i m sure next time adult trip only haha you can stop relax and have a drink in ca adventure ,4,2019-11-07
483,Many changes in six years,this was our first trip in six years there were many changes some old that we missed like the light parade some new and great we went nov and the crowds were probably as low as they ever were this year there was still some hallloween and just beginning to put up christmas the haunted mansion was nightmare before christmas halloween themed totally a new surprise from the elevator to all the scenes star tours was upgraded but i missed the original i guess those who go often would get bored there is a totally new whole land of star wars type galaxy land featuring the millenium falcon the detail in the land and shops was superb there is only one ride and the wait time during the day was about an hour but the ride is worth it no fast pass on this one so invest the hour during the day and go back later at night for a minute wait time it is our favorite ride we only went about six times i am and prefer pilot the middle agers liked all the positions and the year old liked them all but preferred the engineer position there are only six in the cockpit three positions pilot gunner and engineer every ride is a little different depending on the skill of the crew fantasmic light show in frontierland was very good but at my age standing for an hour and minutes was hard on old feet and sitting wasn t much better all in all a great day ,5,2019-11-06
484,Fun with my Son,having been to disneyworld numerous times this was my first foray into the ca version while it was a little more green than i would have thought given where it was situated it still felt like the amusement park in the city the experience was enjoyable but the wait times were quite a bit more than the florida park disney s california adventure was certainly underwhelming but the original disney park largely lived up to its reputation ,4,2019-11-06
485,My happy place,love disneyland park i could go back at least every months so clean and friendly not so crowded as disney world ,5,2019-11-06
486,60 years celebration,i just love disney i have been in paris when i get year in florida when i get year and in los angeles when i get year ,5,2019-11-06
487,Amazing Kennel Club!!!,kenneled our month old puppies at the disneyland kennel club what an amazing experience they were so helpful and accommodating even called when one of the puppies got too upset to see if they could cover their kennel in a blanket for comfort would highly recommend if you need to take your pets on disneyland vacay with you bring your pet here for safe keeping we checked on them and walked them every couple hours and they were perfectly fine ,5,2019-11-05
488,Lives Up To Its Name,it truly is the happiest place on earth i truly enjoyed the new star wars attractions but was of course in awe of all the mainstay attractions it was wonderful to see all the different characters throughout the park definitely make some time to do some shopping for mementos to keep and don t forget to stay for the parade fireworks and fantastic show ,5,2019-11-05
489,Always fun,i had not been in over years it is much the same but there are some new features the food quality has even improved slightly ,5,2019-11-05
490,Terrible crowd management. Disneyworld is so much better.,really disappointed lines seemed much longer than at walt disney world and were more exposed to the sun space mountain was ruined by the star wars overlay which made the ride seem noisy with star wars bits jammed in disney world in florida has a nice clean smell of chlorinated water but disneyland s ambient smell seemed to be one of sewage most disappointing was coming back in the evening a little more than an hour before fireworks but being unable to find a place to watch and being constantly directed toward the exit by cast members our view of the fireworks was having to look over our shoulder as we were prodded along as all the viewing areas were closed and roped off nor were we able to get to any attractions during this time the one pleasant surprise was california adventure which i didn t expected to like but ended up loving especially carsland by the way this visit was actually august ,2,2019-11-05
491,Funnest place on earth,it s true this is the funnest place on earth i would return in a heartbeat i would recommend the fast passes to save time standing in line ,5,2019-11-05
492,Still the best park out there,hadnt been to disneyland in a while and wanted to visit the star wars area i was a little concerned about crowds given this was a fairly new area but went on a wednesday and wasnt too bad the star wars ride and overall area is simply amazing they have really ourdone themselves we even ran in chewy while we were there fantastic fun yes a little expensive but i still think worth it ,5,2019-11-05
493,Love It!,like disneyland better than wdw due to the size of the park and the close proximity of cal adventure and downtown disney ,5,2019-11-05
494,The original Disney destination,let me start by saying we ve been to wdw in florida a lot and so we were keen to see the original park whilst we were in la we knew like paris it wouldn t be the same as it s big sister in orlando but we were disappointed with a couple of things the castle just is soooo small and looks like a toy town version and then the parade was a huge disappointment just a few characters and a band none of the splendour of the festival of fantasy in florida however we did love how easy it was to get around and found the staff super friendly we also loved the max pass system and the photos being free if you have that much better than the super pricey memory maker our favourite rides were haunted holiday mansion smugglers run and big thunder love the little details but found pirates very long compared to orlando we almost had a nap rides aside the character meets are a bit more hit and miss and harder to find and plan but we absolutely loved breakfast at plaza inn food was great and the mix of characters was a delight one word of warning splash mountain take spare clothes i ve had drier baths ,4,2019-11-05
495,It's time for spooky holloween!!!,first time in disneyland for halloweeeeeen with the fireworks at night what a spookiest spectacular experience it would be extremely difficult to leave the front gate with empty hands why not get a mug made with disney x starbucks crossover that you can use everyday on your desk ,5,2019-11-05
496,DISNEY IS THE MOST MAGICAL PLACE,i have lived near disney for a year now and absolutely love going to the park everyday is different and the holiday parades are the best i would recommend also taking the train going from one side of the park to the other so much and free ,5,2019-11-04
497,A very magical park,this was my first visit to disneyland california having already visited florida and paris over the years i was really looking forward to this one with it been the original park alls i can say is it didn t disappoint at all from the moment you walk through into main street you could just feel the history of the place from looking up at the gas lamp in walts apartment to looking down main street and seeing the original castle for the first time this park had such a different feel to all the others i d visited before it was safe to say that after the days me and my family spent in the park it fast became our overall favourite of all the others it was great to ride original rides like the matterhorn and mr toads wild ride to the newer attractions like star wars land speaking of star wars land disney has really set the bar high for other theme parks around the world the land was so immersive and the millennium falcon ride was absolutely amazing while we were there we were booked in at the carnation cafe which was located on main street the food was delicious and the staff were very friendly and welcoming the fireworks at the end of the night we re on another level to other parks the fireworks mixed with the projections down main street were just incredible this has definitely become mine and my family s favourite new park to come to to get our disney fix ,5,2019-11-03
498,Star Wars Rocks it!,this was our third disneyland to have visited after paris and hong kong the rides were amazing but the crowd was too much we visited on a wednesday oct and were surprised to see huge crowd anyway we enjoyed full day in the park and my personal favorites are the star wars millennium falcon and the pirates of the caribbean ride it was a windy day so the evening laser show was cancelled ,5,2019-11-03
499,Amazing Rides!,had a fab day here and it has some good rides but it s so busy here anytime after midday and the crowds are large and the wait times get long and just walking around the park can be tough people bashing into you it s also not as good as disneyworld it feels quite cramped in there and the staff are not as happy or friendly highlights for us however were the indiana jones ride and thunder mountain galaxys edge is over hyped in my view the scenery is incredible but the m falcon ride is not the best not a patch on rides like avatar in disneyworld or the harry potter rides at universal and it s so expensive especially if you wanted a drink in ogas cantina paid for a very small cocktail gone in a few swigs we also found many of the ride times were completely inaccurate thunder mountain took double the time advertised and at least other rides took much longer just be aware and i would advise not booking fast passes until later in case overall we have had a great time here but some improvements would enhance the guest experience further ,4,2019-11-03
500,Good but so busy,well i have been a disneyland ap holder for many years and the parks here in socal are awesome well they are a little expensive yes and a little crowded yes but the magic and the memories they leave are incomparable to any other park or epxerience ,4,2019-11-02
501,Awesome,get the maxpass look online youtube learn how to use it costs a bit extra but worth it did i mention get maxpass wait don t get maxpass i ve just let slip the secret sorry those that have maxpass don t get the maxpass ,5,2019-11-02
502,Get the MaxPass,i prefer disneyland to wdw simply because of it s size disneyland california adventure and downtown disney are all right there together and easily accessible by walking instead of having to wait on a monorail bus boat etc ,5,2019-11-01
503,What can you say but a Great place to be!,we travelled with our son his wife and granddaughters age and the park was a hoot and sure brought out the little kids in us adults to watch our granddaughters faces when meeting the disney characters and on the rides was priceless the only thing that we felt was expensive was food and drinks eg coke was around and bottled water was no different we chose to bring our own sandwiches and drinks which saved some money we had a day max pass hopper so for rides we wanted to go back to we could the overall experience was great and can t wait to go back ,5,2019-10-30
504,Love Disneyland!,we visit disneyland and california adventure usually twice a year i absolutely love it there as do all my children ,5,2019-10-30
505,Hard to Beat Anywhere in the World,disneyland park is certainly one of the iconic destinations in the world its great to see how the park has been updated over the years to accommodate more people and new attractions we ll keep coming back when we re in orange county and will continue to visit other disney parks when we are near them ,5,2019-10-30
506,Used to Be So Much Better,standardization has hurt disneyland all the shops carry much the same things which limits one s interest in them it s still a beautiful park nicer than orlando but it s overcrowded overpriced and the new stuff isn t all that great unless you are a huge star wars fan the new area won t do much for you the upgraded space mountain isn t all that different the lines on the old good rides are seriously bad and most don t have fast passes and the food and drink for the price you should sneak in what you can for a water or a coke really given how expensive it is these additional costs start making it unaffordable for families good trick get there when it opens the first few hours seem to attract fewer people and go during the week ,3,2019-10-29
507,It was nothing to call home about,this is the st time i have been to disneyland with my family my husband s rd time went twice as a child i didn t feel it was anything special over crowded used maxpass on the st day felt it was a waste we found just using fast pass was just as good kids enjoyed it i felt that disney paris was much nicer,3,2019-10-29
508,Everything is broken,we are on day of a dag trip day had ride breakdowns while on the rides while in lines after waiting min in each line day it s am and we are on breakdown number not what i expected out of this supposedly magical place they re obviously skimping on spending their money on much needed maintenance plus there are about half a dozen attractions that are out of service that we won t be able to enjoy at all on our trip what a waste of money go to universal studios instead ,1,2019-10-29
509,Got to be a kid again!!,i hit those gates and i turn into a year old girl i love it here it is my happy place have zero negatives to say and all the positives ,5,2019-10-28
510,Miserable place,i have always been a disneyland fan i do my research go during lighter times and plan ahead when my kids were small we went every couple years and loved it about years passed and on short notice i decided to go with one of my now young adult children i m so sad to see what has happened to my beloved disneyland hotels no longer have tickets i couldn t get tickets online so we had to go stand in line the night before for hour to get our tickets for the next day it is crowded nowhere to sit lines everywhere and we encountered some snappy frustrated employees some were great but others were obviously done you used to be able to find a small corner to chill or sit down nope full every inch guests also seem stressed getting a table is a sketchy venture like too many rats in a cage you can t even get dinner reservations first thing in the morning anymore the whole process for single lines is now a mess no consistency we ended up in the basic line together in the front on more than one occasion seems chaotic a few major rides broken periodically through the day there were so many people there and we all seemed disappointed but making the best of it the magic is fading please restore it disney ,1,2019-10-27
511,"Sadly, the magic is gone",high prices rude service i had a issue that keeps on upsetting me about how a security treated my wife and me on august th in the morning we had a incident where we didn t know we couldn t bring a selfie stick the selfie stick we had was not a cheap one once we got too security they said we would have to take it back to the hotel or they will dispose it the problem was the hotel was far away and we would loose valuable time away from disneyland and the device was not cheap the security was very rude and not polite i totally felt like i was being racially profiled they would not allow us to store it in a locker and insisted we were going to use it we ended up having it get disposed because we didn t want to loose out on precious time in the park and my wifes brother was waiting for us inside the california park it as very difficult knowing i just lost out on this device and how much i spent on it the reason i brought the selfie stick was because i ve seen folks use it on the days prior we also saw after the incident that there were caucasian familys using them and the security said nothing also i want to say is my father n law whom is a sikh man and wears a turban and as we entered and exited the park we really noticed that security would come close to us and stare at us or bring the dogs near us this too me was clearly that we were getting racially profiled ,2,2019-10-27
512,"High prices, rude service.",high prices rude service i was at the park in august from i was on a vacation with my wife her two brothers and my in laws we were having a great time it was magical and a lot of fun we were so excited i had convinced my wife we need to upgrade to the annual pass and we should come back after the following incidents my wife and i didn t get to enjoy our stay and she said no to getting an annual pass i really wanted it this would of came handy because i really wanted to return back for halloween and christmas time i had a issue that keeps on upsetting me about how a security treated my wife and me on august th in the morning we had a incident where we didn t know we couldn t bring a selfie stick the selfie stick we had was not a cheap one once we got too security they said we would have to take it back to the hotel or they will dispose it the problem was the hotel was far away and we would loose valuable time away from disneyland and the device was not cheap the security was very rude and not polite i totally felt like i was being racially profiled they would not allow us to store it in a locker and insisted we were going to use it we ended up having it get disposed because we didn t want to loose out on precious time in the park and my wifes brother was waiting for us inside the california park it as very difficult knowing i just lost out on this device and how much i spent on it the reason i brought the selfie stick was because i ve seen folks use it on the days prior we also saw after the incident that there were caucasian familys using them and the security said nothing also i want to say is my father n law whom is a sikh man and wears a turban and as we entered and exited the park we really noticed that security would come close to us and stare at us or bring the dogs near us this too me was clearly that we were getting racially profiled this was my third time i had visited and the first times were amazing time i was expecting it to be the same but did not expect this i would of thought disney would take care of the folks coming to the park they ve spent a lot of money coming and spend a lot of money at the park i hope one day my wife and i can over come this and maybe one day we can come back and experience disney for halloween and christmas but i think it will take a long time ,1,2019-10-27
513,Long time Disney lovers,we are now annual pass holders we love the evening show for halloween love the new star wars ride and land this place just feels magical it is instant happiness ss soon as you walk in ,5,2019-10-27
514,Birthday,we know disneyland is expensive and expected to pay the for mickey ears and souvenirs but the star wars cantina meat and cheese platter takes the award for a splat of ketchup dijon mustard and shreds of cheese as we were laughing at how ridiculous that was when it was brought the server asked what was wrong and i told her the platter was her response it s not from your planet i think disney could do a better job with their food and customer service people go to disney to have a good time and disney employees know people will keep coming they shouldn t take it for granted though and should treat everyone magical as they say the cantina is something you can skip though need a reservation which we made and they are not flexible at all if you don t cancel you are charged per person and you don t get an opportunity to sit down when you go inside although they do announce that prior to making reservations the experience there felt so rushed as the server brought us the bill and expected a tip before she even served us disney please work on better customer service and since your ticket prices are merchandise is maybe you could at least do something about the quality of the food ,3,2019-10-27
515,Girls Disney Trip,went to do girls disney trip really enjoyed the new orleans section the most highly recommend the disneyland app to help maneuver the park helps you get the fast passes for the rides and set up dining and any other items you may need loved the fantasmic show well worth the price of the meal and show ,4,2019-10-26
516,Great place to visit with a 6 year old,we visited on wednesday october we paid each to get in and for parking i am years old and had never been before so my wife and i went as part of a vacation in the area we rode the splash mountain ride and that was a good ride it was a little jarring on the body though we walked through the snow white exhibit and i was not impressed the technology used moving cardboard cutouts was pretty bad if we took our year old grand daughter i am pretty sure she would love it i don t suggest this for year old people looking for some entertainment unless you just want to be able to say that you have been there dropping to ride a couple rides is pretty pricey ,3,2019-10-26
517,A fun filled day,best place ever i have been to disneyland countless times but never in october fantastic so many cool things to look at the haunted mansion was my favorite i just wish they would have had the jungle cruise and it s a small world decorated for halloween it s a small world was closed at christmas time they have it decorated it is getting awfully expensive though ,5,2019-10-26
518,A Disney Themed shopping mall,i was very disappointed after my visit to disneyland basically it is an overpriced shopping mall with a day admission fee almost all of the rides had between a minute and hour wait and many of them did not even have a fast pass option this was on a weekday afternoon in late october so i can t even imagine how crowed this park must be on weekends or holidays there are no signs in the park so it s really easy to get lost the only places without lines are the zillions of gift shops in the park they are easy to find i spent hours in this park and didn t even see any disney characters walking around for a photo opp i didn t even see mickey mouse oh and matterhorn bobsled was closed for maintenance and had been for an entire week bummer overall very disappointing if you want to see a beautiful theme park try busch gardens williamsburg if you want to see a beautiful castle go to the biltmore in nc if you want to spend a ton of money wandering around a disney themed shopping mall go to disneyland ,2,2019-10-26
519,Nothing beats the Original,this was charming and it made me wish for the older days of the disney world without all the hoopla that you have to go through in florida now ,5,2019-10-25
520,2 days is too long,you can do this park in a day compared with disney world and disneyland paris this is our least favorite the atmosphere isn t nearly as magical you could tell most of the employees were unhappy i m not a fan of having to keep track of your paper ticket for multiple days i will say the parking was surprisingly easy buses run constantly rides broke down a lot and many of the popular attractions were running less than max capacity overall not very impressed unfortunately ,3,2019-10-25
521,I have no reason to ever go back,it s too hot and too much waiting the max pass only works for ride at a time i seriously have no reason to ever go back to this place they also have elders working the lines to get in and that makes it super slow ,1,2019-10-24
522,Chaotic expense,can t say i enjoyed this trip started out badly when i was showing one of the ticket guys my ticket to find out which part of the park i wanted to go in and rather than listen to my question he scanned me in to the adventure park when it turns out i wanted the other park had to get the ticket exchanged but it then wouldn t work another guy exchanged it again but we couldn t load it onto the app as none of our phones would load it he took me to another place to get a refund on the max pass because we couldn t use it with the app and the woman there said we couldn t have a refund she did manage to get our app to work after some time but we d already wasted an hour and a half and we hadn t even got far past the front gate once we got into the centre we found the set up confusing and completely lacking in sign postage which made it really difficult to get around the way to get on the rides was over complicated by having to book allocated time slots the place seemed like one big expensive mediocre food hall with attractions dotted throughout if you re trying to decide between disney and universal universal wins hands down for signage and ease of getting into the rides,1,2019-10-24
523,Disneyland trip,disneyland is indeed the happiest place on earth you are in a different place when you are here ,5,2019-10-24
524,Never a disappointment,disneyland is a always a great time only depends on the crowd we went a sunday and monday and both the max pass and we got to do everything we wanted to and never felt we waited to long in a line the halloween decorations were great and the characters in there costumes were very fun as always the cast members were very nice and helpful will return for another great time ,5,2019-10-23
525,Our least favorite,we did have a wonderful time at disneyland however of them all this has been my least favorite it s so small and therefore so crowded ,5,2019-10-23
526,Happiest Place on Earth,who am i kidding disneyland is always going to be a fun place to go no matter when you go but it s really frustrating when you go for a specific ride when you get there and discover that the ride is closed for maintenance fortunately my favorite ride pirates of the caribbean reopened not too long after i was there but for a while i was afraid it was down for the day another ride which people love to mock it s a small world was down for who knows how long while they refurbish it for the christmas season so that was a disappointment too this post is not to bash disneyland but i do want to point out that i was a little disappointed on my first day with the cleanliness of the place at several points walking down main street and over in the louisiana area there was some really really bad smells coming out from somewhere that smelled like methane or something also the moat surrounding the castle was green and very disgusting to look at i noted that the fountains were off and it appears that it needs serious and quick attention because it did not smell good either on the plus side i thoroughly enjoyed the revamping of the haunted mansion for the th anniversary and the reethi meaning it with nightmare before christmas and the fantasmic show was indeed fantastic i think the light show following fantasmic with jack skellington was okay i want to emphasize that it was just okay it was really good except some of the special effects like the dancing skeletons seems rushed and hokie they did not look as good and polished as the immediate previous performance again it seemed very rushed especially when i could see frame skips in the snake animations ,4,2019-10-23
527,Fun when times right,my wife and i went to disneyland with my grandchild who was turning three when we order the food we ordered ahead of time while sitting in the restaurant or on a ride my order came up in less than five minutes and people were still standing in line what a great technology to order food on your iphone or smart phone and get it within a few minutes ,4,2019-10-23
528,Amazing way to order your food,we really enjoyed our visit to disneyland it had been many years since we came this time we had our toddler with us she loved everything from the characters interactions the rides and of course the food especially the sweets and the halloween theme items ,5,2019-10-22
529,Fantastic,disneyland is a fun family vacation there is something here for kids and adults i love the rides and just walking around the park taking in the sights and sounds everything here is above standard especially the cast members attitudes and helpfulness i also love the shopping and all of the stores i can t wait until i can return ,5,2019-10-22
530,Magical,disneyland is truly a magical adventure it hold memories for me for practically my whole life the attention to detail puts you in a fantasyland vacationland it appeals to those who have happy memories and want to see some of the vintage original rides and those who want to go on the most updated adventures but it is busier than ever they do help the line waits with fast passes and their app is helpful the only thing i would ask them to do better is to figure out a way to limit the people they let in then everyone would have a better experience even so it is the best quality amusement park in the world and worth a trip especially with children ,5,2019-10-21
531,Not a fan. Only lasted 5 hours.,we had magic morning passes but along with others could not find a line to get in the signage was poor and we didn t get in until ish then we ran right to the ride we wanted and it was a min wait already we did the fast pass for a few rides we could with our year old she liked dumbo but it was a long wait we enjoyed the mickey beignets and the dole whip was meh but the mobile ordering was annoying we had gift cards we wanted to use but could only find mobile ordering available then we waited for the jungle cruise for minutes which was outdated really a monkey with a gun and then the tour guide has a gun and then we rode the train back and waited another min when the sign said we were done hoping to see some princesses but they were not to be found at least we got a picture with mickey again after a min wait will not be back ,3,2019-10-19
532,The greatest day ever,great place to spend with the family lines are long but move quickly choose you too choice rides for fast pass early since the more popular rides stop giving out fast pass hours before park closes the star war section at this park is awesome ,5,2019-10-19
533,There will never be another!!!,they have done it right for over years how many businesses can be that consistent it s extraordinary i confess i do not cater the park when it is crowed i just don t enjoy the crowds which is most of the time thus my review is based only when there is little or no wait time to get on the rides ,5,2019-10-17
534,"Fun, but expensive",had a good time hang onto your wallet because it s pretty expensive loved the max pass but again ya gotta pay for it loved the halloween theme and halloween downtown light show ,4,2019-10-16
535,Max pass failure,disneyland needs to figure out their fast passes situation our family spent half the time arguing over which fast pass to use via mobile app we have been to disney world and they have it figured out better than california get the wristbands ,3,2019-10-16
536,Good times,went the opening weekend of the oogie boogie bash slammed packed according to everyone one of the busiest weekends of the year great halloween decorations still enjoyed ,5,2019-10-15
537,Disneyland!,it s magical i m and it still brings out the little kid in me fun and nostalgic rides the park is clean the cast members are friendly and helpful bring your patience and a good attitude make sure to watch the parades and the shows ,5,2019-10-15
538,Studio Tram Tour,tuesday th october what a joke one tram working minute ride plus minutes to load unload at least staff members working the ride and simply hanging about plus driver not contributing to a successful day is this the standard dlp has fallen to ,1,2019-10-15
539,Happiest place on earth,i ve been to disney world in orlando and loved it so much that i couldn t imagine loving it even more the park is so beautiful the attractions are great the toon town area is lovely there are so many great things to point out the quick service food is amazing and the guest service is above and beyond i have to say that the guest service is even better than at disney world they really make you feel special and unique and the cast members are extremely nice and seem genuinely happy there are some attractions that they also have at disney world but they can have some small differences like the haunted mansion big thunder mountain small world it s totally worth it to go and pay attention to the similarities and the differences highly recommend if you re young or not ,5,2019-10-15
540,Happiest Place On Earth.,we were a group of adults travelling to the us for work and had a spare day to check out disneyland we went on saturday september th and we were worried it would be busy being on the weekend and the start of their halloween season it was busy but we stayed from am pm and managed to ride rides and see the street parade and fantasmic it was hectic but such a fun day do your research and plan your trip to disneyland particularly if you only have a day or two the max pass system was invaluable to us we walked straight onto most rides and as soon as we were in the fast pass line we were booking the next ride on our phones personally we went to galaxys edge at rope drop to get the millennium falcon ride done first and then moved around the park getting there at park opening is a must because it gets busier as the day goes on take a bottle of water in with you there s plenty of water fountains around to refill ,5,2019-10-15
541,Happiest place on earth & the price tag to match,our third trip to disneyland had a great time although rides malfunctioned whilst there for probably half hour which caused longer delays the fast max pass was a waste of money with up to hour waits to return on ride the old system worked much better plenty of places to get food drinks would recommend getting there as early as possible as gets so busy mid morning onwards ,4,2019-10-15
542,Fun Place,first off word of advice from a california native when planning to visit disneyland please know there will always be lines and a crowd plan accordingly and expect this as long as you have a positive attitude and realistic picture the experience will be much more pleasurable and a great time know that every day of the year disneyland is busy this is one of the top california destinations and consider yourself very lucky if you do visit and find the park to less crowded know that you will probably get on to larger attraction rides in one day otherwise you will need to get a to to five day pass to explore and get on everything know that you will probably get on to larger attraction rides in one day otherwise you can choose to purchase one of the day passes to explore and get on everything you would like use the fast passes our suggestion would be to go to the first location of your favorite ride and get your fast pass to return at the designated time on the ticket enjoy your time while waiting with your loved ones and don t focus on the time it s the fun in every moment that will make this day special also adults if you would like to indulge in a drink or two our suggestion would be to choose a place outside the theme park at downtown disney we would not suggest splurging at oga s cantina in the star wars area you will be disappointed if you choose this option as their drinks are pre mixed double the price from outside the park and no option to sit not worthwhile at all unless you are a star wars junkie and it is a must do for you much better options to give yourself time to relax for a moment outside the theme park simply get your hand stamped when you re exiting and re enter re charged and ready for more fun one last tip locals it is definitely worthwhile to turn this visit into a staycation and book one of the hotels that is located close by this way you don t have to worry about driving back home after a fun filled and tiring day this has been a game changer to nit commute the hour drive exhausted enjoy ,4,2019-10-14
543,Another great time!,disneyland the happiest place on earth are you kidding me the most expensive place on earth we planned this trip for over a year taking the granddaughter to make memories big mistake we checked before we went for lower crowd days and i was told by the vacation club the days we chose in october were lower than normal sounds good all four days the park was red never have i seen crowds like this shoulder to shoulder disney recommended max pass read the fine print you can only hold one fast pass at a time until you have used it glad i spent the money on that but sir you get one hour early admission to the park so does everybody else it gets you in one of the longest lines i have ever seen then you get into the park but you go no where more lines no early rides just get in line oh yeah one character breakfast if you stay on property we offer a character breakfast with one character at a price read the fine print we offer not include yahoo are in the park my four year old granddaughter loves the characters theres one get in line get close and a cast member tells you story we have to move that happens over and over again breaks a little girls heart now you get in line to ride rides hope your patient because this takes a while if it doesn t break down your lucky never did get to ride the roller coaster at adventure land because it was always broke down i could go on but no more time for disney this place is one disappointment after another this trip cost a lot of money and was not worth it my suggestion is save your money and book an all inclusive somewhere in the caribbean now thats a holiday ,5,2019-10-14
544,Disneyland Disappoints!!!,the magic of disneyland is real i try to make it here at least once a year but wasn t able to last year so much has been added and changed since the last visit but mostly for the good and because so many people thought it would be crowded because of galaxy s edge the park was not as crowded as it has been in past visits making this even nicer this is the only park that walt walked in and is special just for that but the magic remains regardless of change the price of getting in has gone up a lot but it is still worth it for a few day visit ,1,2019-10-14
545,Truly Magical!,not the disney of yesteryear employees are not trained properly and it shows with large crowds regardless of the day employees are short tempered and rude walt would not approve for the the young people they hire cannot handle the pressure of their job we spend days in the park and we re yelled at a minimum of day on one occasion i was shouted at times they were for things like walking through star wars and being shouted to move leaning against a wall in a corner of a building that had an alcove it out i had hurt my back from a wet tile bathroom floor in the park and needed to rest a minute due to all the previous times i was shouted at i made sure i was in an area no one was walking through apparently they don t care and will yell regardless when i told this rude man i had hurt my back he shouted that i should then find a chair he did not say it in a nice way either did he ask if i was ok no did he offer a place i could rest my back no i witnessed many people innocently walking a path and an employee would start shouting at them no one was in danger no one was in the way of anyone no one was unruly just being shouted at for what seemed to be an outlet for a frustrated employee i feel if they were trained they would not be frustrated and possibly be able to do their job better we actually had reservations to go back next year and we canceled them it s going to be a long break before i ll go back again definitely not the happiest place on earth any longer sad to see for imagination for hospitality ,5,2019-10-14
546,Unfriendly and unorganized,i was pleasantly surprised to find that i enjoyed disneyland i went with trepidation and ended up having a great day a wonderful location with great cast members and a happy vibe,2,2019-10-14
547,We made it,great day trip in anaheim and visited disneyland and disney california adventure besides the long line ups the restaurants were fantastic and the area was great would highly recommend ,5,2019-10-14
548,"Wonderful, but busy!",traveled to socal with my small group of teenage girl scouts concierge was over the top helpful as always presenting of my girls with graduation plus another special badge to commemorate their last year as girl scouts we opened and closed the park having a great time star wars experience was a hit girls did the ride twice definitely a memorable overall experience ,4,2019-10-14
549,Always a Pleasure,disneyland is disneyland what can be said but it is so much fun and wonderful lots of people but the lines were not horrendous we ate several meals there and several snacks the dole whip was out of this world the french market had stew and corn chowder in bread bowls delicious weather was great and it truly is the happiest place on earth just know that entrance is expensive meals are expensive and purchases are expensive it is definitely well worth any expense ,5,2019-10-13
550,The Happiest Place on Earth,yes it s sometimes crowded and the tickets are expensive but there s no other place in the world like disneyland we last visited in september after most kids were back in school and on weekdays so the crowds were not a problem our longest wait in line was minutes for the new star wars ride and it was minutes immersed in the star wars universe so it was no problem at all the star wars area is amazing by the way disneyland is much smaller than disney world in florida so it s much more accessible don t miss its sister park california adventure next door it s newer but no less entertaining than disneyland ,5,2019-10-13
551,Birthday,i love disney i celibatet my and yearsday at disney in orlando in paris in los angeles,5,2019-10-13
552,Unbelievable price for a bottle of water. $5.00 US,be prepared for a lot of walking just to get in the entrance is a long way don t know why there is not a shuttle to take you up to the gate from the buses once inside the distances are phenomenal caught the train but that does not stop at all sections eg star wars bad planning spending millions of s here but no thought for the poor people having to walk the distances it would be nice to be able to hop on a trolley and get off at different places at the park no wonder so many people hire scooters think we walked steps one day prices of food drink are crazy how can you justify a bottle of water for same as a soft drink i can buy bottles at walgreen for but then it s the having to carry it around you can t keep it cool i know this is the normal thing for theme parks but why so expensive another disappointment why is the parade on at so late for the little children we waited hours to see it i would have liked to have bought my granddaughters a lovely backpack but us is too much for aussies the way our value is at the moment we had a day pass but really one only needs or just wasted our money we had done both parks in days maybe with little ones you need longer never mind it was a wonderful experience ,4,2019-10-13
553,Disappointing trip to the most expensive place on earth,i saved up for a year to take my kids and granddaughters to disneyland the day finally got here and i was so disappointed the first thing i noticed was the smell of main st it didn t have the sweet smell of candy or baked goods i didn t hear the fun music that plays while you walk around the park there were plenty of people there even if disneyland was supposed to be empty every time i turned around disney was trying to get more and more money out of my pocket if you buy a corn dog with chips flavored chips like doritos cost two dollars more than plain lays same size bag they close california adventure early for a halloween party that costs each person dollars extra to attend that s with the disneyland ticket for the day the pirates of the carabian has become the jack sparrow show they had dressed up the hunted mansion for halloween but i think its better left alone one thing that really got me was they moved the smoking area clear out of the park so you have to go through security every time you want to smoke even worse they provided no smoking area no bench no ashtray no shade thank you disneyland for a miserable time at the not so happiest place on earth ,3,2019-10-12
554,Disney fun,what a great day we had first time visitors expected delays for rides was amazed at just how clean the place is and how new everything appears to be nothing seems worn the entire cast staff are just great the entertainment brilliant ,5,2019-10-12
555,Family Fun,what more can you say about disneyland even adults can smile all day we had a two day tickets and still didn t manage to visit every section we were fortunate enough to visit when there was no holiday and in the middle of the week so the lines where tolerable if you di visit on the weekend or on a holiday than i d suggest buying a freepass to avoid long lines ,5,2019-10-12
556,Go with a good attitude,we were skeptical i haven t been to disney in over years and wanted to take my kids and years old so they have the memories we figure this would be our first and last time going are there lines yes weren t as bad as we thought the indiana jones ride at night had us waiting an hour other rides were to minutes pirates star wars autopia roger rabbit haunted mansion early morning the fast pass helped it s not perfect since there are rides that don t accept fast pass i really wanted to check out the matterhorn bobsleds but well over hour wait but it was worth it since we got a few extra rides the quality of the rides is amazing the details no one does it like disney i m a sucker for its a small world if you get there early maybe midweek and mentally prepare for the experience crowds waits i think it s worth it for a once in a lifetime experience i say once in a lifetime because it is very expensive but the kids will love it ,5,2019-10-12
557,I felt like I was at Disney World,i always wanted to see disneyland the original being from florida i wanted to see if it was better or different it is both the biggest difference i noticed was the small cinderella s castle being much smaller than disney world well done and i can check off my bucket list ,5,2019-10-11
558,Awesome,fun to revisit old favourites but best of all was galaxy s edge i keep reading about the lack of crowds it felt pretty much hopping to me the attention to detail was great minute wait for the smugglers run was fine a great days ,5,2019-10-11
559,Fun but busy,we enjoyed our days at disneyland it was years since we had last visited and was great to see it was still the magical place we fondly remembered the food and drinks are expensive but it s all part of the experience we had a very enjoyable days at both parks and especially loved the electric light parade cars land was my favourite of all areas felt a little underwhelmed with batu it didn t feel finished and felt like it was all about the retail and gaining revenue i feel bad saying this as i was wanting to love it but sadly didn t perhaps over time it will improve ,5,2019-10-11
560,Classic Disney,get the max pass and start booking rides as early as you can the star wars area is amazing but the ride was only ok great food options but no booze on this side there s so much to see here so come with a general plan and go for the park hopper ,5,2019-10-11
561,Should have given the $380 to the homeless people near the entrance,booked a trip to take our little girl to the magical kingdom for her first and possibly only time ever as we live in new zealand we went the extra mile to pay for fast passes and booked tickets on monday in the fall assuming most kids were in school boy were we wrong we had a hotel across the road from disneyland and arrived at am only to spend hours in line to get into the park after which we went around to try to select our favourite rides we wanted to go on and ended up waiting anywhere from hour to an hour and a half in lines so ended up only going on about rides for a day that was hours long and in the end felt completely broken not to mention trying to get into one of the restaurants for lunch that is one of the only places to offer gluten free options for our year old coeliac daughter to be turned away at the door because we didn t have a reservation we gave up at pm we tried to go back again before heading to the airport on wednesday thinking the crowds would be better so spent another usd we were wrong again minute waits in line for rides we downloaded the app that said our wait would be min but in actual fact it ended up being an hour and a half we spent to go on ride all day my advice check online how busy the park is try to use the app and hope it s accurate about the wait times or maybe just go straight to florida and leave disneyland anaheim to the residents with the annual passes ,1,2019-10-11
562,Excellent,you need to arrive when the gates open as you will be there until closing if you have kids we went on some rides more than once the star wars theme area was awesome and if you are a fan this is a must we highly recommend paying the extra per person for the max pass this allows you to select rides throughout the day and get to the front of queues by using the disney app which is also used for california adventure ,5,2019-10-11
563,Cozy park,loved the coziness of this park not super spread out lines were not exceptionally long the fall decorations were phenomenal ,5,2019-10-10
564,Disappointing and crowded,this was our first and i suspect now only trip to disneyland last year we visited tokyo disneysea which was one of the most amazing places we have ever visited and sparked delight in disney an immaculate and magical place with incredible attention to detail with an unprecedented block of leave this year we decided to visit the usa for the first time and having two young star wars loving boys had disneyland on our must do list we planned our stay in la to include a mid week visit to disneyland hoping that crowds would be manageable it seems we were wrong it was much more crowded than disneysea which appeared to have much to do with local annual pass holders queues for almost everything were frustratingly long wifi was patchy and the app crashed frequently which made the food preordering system pretty useless several of the rides were tired compared to disneysea staff weren t that engaged potentially equally numbed by the endless crowds mobility scooters everywhere added to the difficulty in getting around the attention to detail however in the galaxys edge was wonderful really creating a special atmosphere and redeemed our experience somewhat after the magic of disneysea i had looked forward to discovering the wonders of other disney parks around the world fortunately for our bank account our experience in california has squashed that desire for anyone who lives in australia like we do i would not recommend basing any travel plans around visiting the california site i suppose if you are a local or in the are a for another reason it might be worth it the most magical place on earth it most definitely is not ,3,2019-10-10
565,Wait times are crazy,we enjoyed our time here it was much husbands first time and wasn t able to ride all the rides due to the long wait times i know you can get fass passes but still and the price of food is crazy,3,2019-10-10
566,What happened to the friendly cast members?,we just returned from disneyland for the nd time in years this is the first time my husband adult daughter and myself noticed things weren t how they have always been the employees working the rides are not nearly as friendly and helpful as in the past and their attitudes are definitely not up to disney standards anymore we also noticed the park isn t as clean as in recent years the storefront windows on main street were absolutely filthy and i m not talking about one window but everyone of them in front of the disney store again not what we have seen in the past with disney this is the first time we thought that if this is the new norm for disney employees being unfriendly yawning visiting with one another and not paying any attention to the gobs of people walking right past them as they sneak into the fast pass lane we saw this happening constantly and not even smiling or greeting their visitors we will find somewhere else to spend our hard earned money take note disney ,3,2019-10-10
567,Three generations had a blast!,this is still my favourite park love all things disney with three age groups the rides and attractions here suited all of us the princesses and other characters circulating were highlights for our autograph seeking granddaughter the people playing these parts are wonderully kind patient and always in their role there were lots of places to get drinks and snacks and plenty of shopping opportunities we were disappointed with the star wars area rather low key and almost boring hope the next stage makes it better ,5,2019-10-09
568,First visit to California Disney,we had a great time but there are definitely pros cons to this location i would say more pros than cons though we usually stay at a disney property but did not this time we did stay nearby and walked to the park easily in about min i loved the location both park entrances right across from each other made it very easy to pop back and forth we bought the park hop tickets which gives lots of flexibility we loved having so many rides all in one place compared to disney world where you must travel often to get to various parks rides because they are all so spread out i think our family decided we enjoyed disney adventure park even more than disneyland because of the amazing rides we went the very first week of october and it was quite crowded but tolerable the pier area with the ferris wheel was great along with the amazing incredicoaster fast passes were pretty easy to get but sometimes the times weren t always the most convenient and you are only given one option a ride or two broke down during our visit but they were flexible on us using our fast pass later once it was back up and running telling us to come back at any time after ride was fixed food was plentiful and easy to find sometimes at disney world we found that if you saw something you wanted you better grab it then because it may not be at the next area stop it was a fun week with amazing weather we were able to experience the storytellers cafe at the disneyland hotel which is very nice space mountain at disneyland is called hyperspace mountain and you ride with a buddy it is a two seater which is nice as compared to orlando s version where it is one per seat splash mountain never disappoints no matter where you ride it it was different in that it was a single seater too with about in the compartment my one and only major complaint was the cast members at the parks surprisingly they were average at best with friendliness being courteous etc normally you really do feel like you are in another world at a disney property or park even my and year old children noticed the difference in cast members in anaheim verses those we ve encountered in orlando i am not talking characters or those at the disneyland hotel but those who checked your ticket through the entry gates our first day we gave them our paper tickets we printed online and they printed us a small ticket that we could then sync with the app and just zap from our phones making it so much easier to keep up with everything disney unfortunately the lady who set this up connected to wrong photo with every ticket in our family of so every time we came into a park we were given a million questions and told we had done it wrong the gate attendant took our photos as she handed us the tickets so we had no control over that it became almost comical every time we entered and were questioned frustrating to say the least but minor in the scheme of things i hope disney will try to work on there welcoming committee as guests enter the gates what we encountered was not normal disney but it wasn t just one person so definitely disappointing last downtown disney does not disappoint we enjoyed a dinner one night and dessert another we started on a tuesday and by friday the parks were much more crowded but downtown disney was crazy crowded we would like to go back again in a few years to check out the new marvel area once it is completed and hopefully all cast members will have learned the magic of being a part of disney ,4,2019-10-09
569,Our family Disneyland trip,we had an amazing days here my son loved it we were lucky because it wasn t too busy we had so much fun everything was great very expensive but worth it to see it through my sons eyes ,5,2019-10-09
570,Love Disneyland!!!,i always enjoy disney i would suggest getting there as early as possible and get your fastpass to the ride you really want to get on the price to get in is absolutely crazy but if you want to go allow yourself the time also if you want to eat inside the park check into getting reservations ahead of time to the restaurant ,5,2019-10-09
571,Gay days YAY!!,always a fun time at dland was more fun having attended gay days at disney the only disappointment was that galaxy edge was only completed ,5,2019-10-09
572,Fantastic Fun!,the decorations the characters the rides everything was awesome while there were a few high traffic times there were also plenty of short waits awesome cast members great food and fun ,5,2019-10-08
573,Too crowded,i was disappointed this time at disneyland we went off season on a monday and tuesday and it was so crowded we missed the electric light parade and the other shows we used the fast pass which the app was very hard to understand at first the rides weren t too bad typically min wait times with the fast pass main street after pm you couldn t get near i think the annual pass for local californians is a mistake they take their kids after school and make it too crowded for visitors from out of state who pay more for the tickets shame on you disney ,2,2019-10-08
574,Yes I visited Disneyland park on my own with a 10 day pass!,i absolutely love disneyland park this is the third or fourth time i have visited and i will be back again i love the way it is totally immersive and you feel like you re in another world it is the happiest place i know of the attractions are wonderful and never seem to get old the galaxys edge is a great new area and although i ran through it quickly today i will spend more time there tomorrow i would suggest spending at least days to see disneyland and for california adventure park i have a day pass which aussies and new zealanders can get pay for days get free days and today was day i am excited to spend lots of time there wandering around at my leisure making sure i don t miss anything this review is for disneyland my next review will cover california adventure park ,5,2019-10-08
575,Great vacation.,the happiest place on earth you can never have a bad day when you are there going during the holidays makes it even more special ,5,2019-10-08
576,MaxPass was worth the extra $15.,we purchased day park hopper tickets with maxpass this included fast pass by mobile phone and the ability to download the disney photos because the park was fairly busy this saved us some time in that we didn t have to go to attractions to pick up fast passes in person once the fastpass time arrived we could choose another fast pass the app also allows you to see stand by wait times we had never used the disney photographers before and took the opportunity to do so this time and received a couple of nice photos ,4,2019-10-08
577,Loved the size,compared to disneyworld we loved the size of this park the park hopper pass we actually used without being exhausted by the time you made it to the second park the magic hours were not very beneficial as they had magic hours for all resorts not just the ones on property also there were only parts of the park open that was disappointing overall we wish it was closer to us because we would come back for sure ,5,2019-10-08
578,OVERCROWDED! The Magic is Missing.,what has happened to disneyland there are many things to love about disney parks but standing in line for minutes for each attraction makes the day painful and unproductive the new galaxy s edge looks amazing but there is almost nothing to do there they don t tell you until after you are in the park that the cantina bar restaurant has a two week waiting list for required reservations that leaves only one ride in the entire land and boom your much anticipated star wars day is over then it s back to more long lines for all the old rides space mountain has a new star wars twist that s really wonderful but the remainder of tomorrowland is sadly outdated and anything but futuristic a major overhaul is needed throughout the park and most importantly some reasonable crowd limits need to be imposed come on disney you are better than this ,2,2019-10-08
579,Just too many people,we were unable to enjoy almost anything at disney because of the outrageous crowds do they ever put a max on the number of people allowed in at any given time lines are so long that i oveheard children saying they spent as much as hours waiting for just one popular attraction we spent each for tickets expecting to spend a whole day we left after hours just to escape the insanilty of hundreds of thousands of people jammed into a place meant for less than half that many the cast are as great as usual except that i saw not one in character or costume we had great childkhood memories that were dashed we won t be back ,2,2019-10-08
580,Amzing !!!!! Unbelievable !!!! Magical !!!!!,words cannot describe the magic that disneyland has to offer it doesn t matter whether you re years old or years old when you enter disneyland you feel like you re a kid you enter another world that is simply breathtaking and mind blowing all the rides and the attractions in disneyland are like no other you definitely get trapped into the magical world that is disneyland ,5,2019-10-08
581,Save YOUR money $$$,where do i begin disneyland has changed for the worse in just a few years the magic has been trampled by the stampedes of people strollers obesity and scooters outrageous and very dangerous the food is super overpriced the fastpass should be re named slowpass rides break down frequently with long painful boring wait times this was my th time visiting and the last the park used to be wonderful and magical but that s just no longer so the halloween version of the haunted house was awful cheap and tacky decorations why mess up this classic original star wars is misplaced and should not be in disneyland avoid this once magical place ,1,2019-10-07
582,Great during slow time of year,i ve been to disneyland several times in my life but recently went in september this was by far the best time of year i d been as the crowds were low the wait times were reasonable and the weather was pleasant i d recommend using the max pass option if you re there during a high season ,5,2019-10-07
583,"It's Disney, how can it fail",disney magic at its best brilliant theme carried throughout the park clean tidy and friendly helpful staff only criticism is drinks and food are very expensive considering this the original disney park it doesn t show it s age ,5,2019-10-07
584,Good times.,we visited disneyland for days with the park hopper everything went smoothly beginning at security bag check the lines were long to get in but it only took about mins to get through the gate because the system is very efficient the park was very clean and organized we used fast pass and took advantage of single rider options for rides that offered it to avoid standing in long lines the food and water is costly but that s to be expected they offer a good variety of food options the rides were fun the shops were wonderful too what else can i say except i can t wait to go back again ,5,2019-10-07
585,Go In for Three Day Ticket,i suggest to purchase a three day dual park ticket to see both parks at liesure you will need atleast one day for disney california adventure and two days for disneyland park in my view park hopping ticket is not necessary ,4,2019-10-07
586,Happiest place in the WORLD!,we can not get enough of this magical place it is my family s favorite destination to visit no mater what age you are the moment you step foot in the park you are engulfed in that feel good energy the smell the sounds and all the food and attractions it is a combination of happiness that everyone should experience ,5,2019-10-07
587,Just some advice,first fly into the burbank airport saved us dollars per ticket from sacramento on southwest compared to flying into orange county if you go to galaxy s edge don t be disappointed it is still a work in progress take time to admire the intricate artwork and craftsmanship that went to creating that place the millennium falcon ride is worth the wait the queue line is amazing then try a ronto wrap those are great a max pass is worth the price ,5,2019-10-06
588,Birthday trip for toddler!,well we hadn t been to disneyland in yrs brought little one for rd bday we stayed at the disneyland hotel and were there for nights days what an amazing time we had parks were set up for halloween and also it was a quite time of the year us schools has just started back loved every minute ,5,2019-10-06
589,Great little park,the original but also a very much smaller version to disneyworld in florida in fact if i had small children i feel this is the better park of the two to take them to until they are older reason is that it s smaller easier to get around less daunting due to being oversized and is more intimate the fact that you have two parks next door to each other and then a shopping and restaurant area also only a few minutes walk away really does make this a special few days i loved it and would go again oh and there s plenty of decent hotels close by all within a few mins walk what more could you want ,5,2019-10-06
590,Always Disney,its just always disneyland without a doubt the happiest place on earth the new star wars land is really cool ,5,2019-10-06
591,Highly recommend,doesn t matter how old you are the kid in you comes out it is the happiest place on earth first trip we did the three day hopper pass x day in each park and third day between both second time four day pass so x days in each park ,5,2019-10-06
592,Definitely the happiest place in the world!,omg what can i say but thank you disneyland we all were looking forward to disneyland but it really exceeded all our expectations we have coeliac daughters and disneyland nailed the allergy aide of things with separate gf menus everywhere and such attention to detail all our kids from ages to loved everything about disneyland and california park the staff were incredible and atmosphere encouraged us all to forget life and just enjoy the moment and have fun together we traveled with my parents in their s and they loved it too everyone needs to do disney ,5,2019-10-06
593,Wheelchair friendly? Maybe not. Still fun? For sure.,we got back a week ago from doing three days at disneyland with park hoppers as well as the oogie boogie bash on a separate night my sister uses a wheelchair as she can not walk we heard they were very accommodating there but we didn t find that so much they have done a great job on most of the newer rides on offering an accessible vehicle however many rides even with their transfer devices were impossible for my sister to get in and out of we did expect that though so we weren t very disappointed however we were disappointed with many of the cast members they honestly didn t seem to share any of that disney magic we heard so much about of course that being said we did encounter about four outstanding cast members in our days there that made up for all the unhappy ones recommendations max pass all the way use your mobile fast pass mobile ordering and don t miss out on photo pass what amazing features bring some energy bars or something if you re on a budget because even the small snacks are or each which adds up if there s a few of you buy some cheap rain ponchos somewhere else far away they sell them at the store by grizzly mountain ride for each not worth it to stay dry on a few rides in my opinion bring a hydra pack so much easier to carry around water on your back than in bottles and gives you a place to keep your phone chargers snacks etc while still being hands free skip the character line ups and do breakfast at minnie s instead you ll meet tons of characters right at your table and get a full tummy be prepared to walk your buns off haha have fun ,4,2019-10-06
594,We are starting to regret our visits lately. Pushy staff,my family has made three trips to disney this year quite the expense for a family of four twice with my older daughters school and once with my work staff has been very aggressive trying to control crowds for parades separating our family twice when we were trying to cross between frontierland and tomorrowland not cool when young children are held back from by an adult very scary for a eleven year old we were trying to keep eye contact on her from afar but staff kept trying to get us to move we had to act like we were ordering food to get them to leave us alone the second time it was an older kid that took things more in stride but we were worried ourselves about getting separated because he told us minutes earlier his phone was almost dead the first couple of times five out of the main attractions were broke or shutdown for maintenance what a waste of money reminded me of disney world in the early eighties when everything was breaking down our next trip will be awhile hopefully they learn and improve their guest relations ,3,2019-10-05
595,Great!,was great to see where disneyland parks started for me the standout rides at the park are the haunted mansion big thunder mountain railroad i was amazed at how clean the park is how friendly and helpful and up for a chat all the cast members are they are the real super heros here the fri sat sun fireworks and electrical parade is awesome to and worth the wait just bare in mind leave splash mountian till the end of the day because you will get drenched ,5,2019-10-05
596,Disney Fun !,step into a world of fun and happiness lots of fun rides so much color and imagination meet and greet disney s characters from mickey mouse winnie the pooh to peter pan etc etc steamboat exciting parades it s a small world a must see popcorn and pretzels at every turn ice cream parlors so much to see and eat ,5,2019-10-05
597,Disneyland,wow what an experience especially seeing it through the eyes of my grandchildren expensive but so worth it ,5,2019-10-04
598,Disneyland,great vacation destination have a park plan buy park tickets before trip to save time we had max pass but no park hopper worked great for us,5,2019-10-03
599,Always an Amazing Park,as someone who travels to the usa to solely visit the disney parks i am bias but i love disneyland wdw is bigger but disneyland has all the charm and shorter lines go midweek and you ll be on every ride in no time max pass is worth the money if you have limited time the only thing i wish is that they would re do the castle it is just too small especially when you see cinderella s castle at wdw sleeping beauty aurora needs a bigger castle i m usually not for change but an upgrade here would be awesome i also love the classic rides that are still here like mr toad alice in wonderland and pinocchio which you can t ride anywhere else ticket prices have gone through the roof which is a disapointment star wars land does nothing for me i wish they added a frozen land or something more disney marvel also isn t an interest so i m not a huge fan of the fact they tore down the best kiddie land bugs land to put that crap in ,5,2019-10-02
600,Do. NOT. Bother!!,wow like something out of a nightmare or bad disney special even with very low expectations regarding the quality of the entertainment options crowds and food quality i never expected to be so thoroughly underwhelmed by the day we spent at disneyland as an avid fan of theme parks i ve pretty much seen them all in the us and asia over the years but had never visited dl the rides are very very boring and outdated with surprisingly very little to do with anything disney the crowds are just insane we visited on a wednesday to the point where it s dangerous and unsafe there are just so many strollers wheelchairs and the morbidly obese aka average american scooters blocking every walkway so you re always moments away from being mowed down the food is hands down the worst i ve encountered in any park anywhere in the world absolutely foul rancid trash honestly for the love of all things fun do not waste your precious time and money in this soul wallet sucking hell ,1,2019-10-02
601,4 day park hopper pass,our family had a good time at the parks we went between both parks throughout the day hit them early when there s less people liked the fast pass system get one do a ride and then use your fast pass for your next one the new star wars area was impressive being able to take in your own snaxs food is great ,4,2019-10-02
602,Worst place on Earth,seriously why anyone would put themselves through this is beyond me i will never ever go back to that hell on earth too damn crowded even with an express pass we could only get on ride in hours universal studios beats this place hands down they need to stop selling tickets endlessly there must have been people there today any wonder there are minute waits for rides that s when you get to the gate the line extends past that another meters we paid for a day pass so we have to take a loss on that and also move on to another place because there is nothing else to do here i have never been angrier at anything in my life ,1,2019-09-30
603,Memorable holiday,we had a day pass which we went the first days of our weeks holiday and did last days at the end it turned out to be a very special place for us because my daughter s partner proposed to her in front of the castle something we will never forget,5,2019-09-30
604,Overcrowded and fast pass rip off,wow soo crowded even on a monday the fast pass is a rip off you have to wait a long time until you can use it again the rides we did were fun but the crowds were overwhelming the kids enjoyed it but up to a point why any adults would go unless with kids is beyond me anyway it s done and thankfully never have to return ,1,2019-09-30
605,Disneyland terrorland,we just visited disneyland with families and had such a horrible weekend it is sooooo busy you even have to wait half an hour to get a coffee one hour to hour queues for attractions no place to sit and relax it s just too crowded our kids were very disappointed because we couldn t visit that many attractions due to waiting time and the whole experience was just very stressful and disappointing and expensive the big hotel we slept in was a disappointment as well just a cash cow no good vibes anywhere just waiting even for breakfast ,1,2019-09-30
606,Days were too long,disneyland was good but not great three days across two parks was too much for our six and ten year old the fireworks are on extremely late for young children and the queues for the rides are ridiculous and can change without notice while you are standing in them a child is classed as anyone over ten and everything is extremely expensive ,3,2019-09-30
607,New Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge!,if you ever dreamed of being in a star wats movie this is the place to go chewbacca stormtroopers and other characters roam this land music plays and the sounds of ships coming and going are heard the restaurants and stores are extremely detailed with characters of their own on both sides first order and resistance take time to really take a closer look there are fountains for filling water bottles the restrooms continue the spaceport theme so much detail to appreciate seeing the ships at the the docking bays is really an exciting moment from the first tie fighter to the millennium falcon which you get to go inside and actually ride in the cockpit this ride is all a star wars fan could hope for and because it has so many possible variations including changing from day to night fans can ride it over and over again we went early and the line moved pretty quickly there is more to come with the second first order ride experience and buildup of the resistance area even if you are not a star wars fan i think it would be hard not to be impressed by the incredible detail here ,5,2019-09-29
608,Fun for adults and kids alike.,i was at the opening of disneyland in maybe that is one reason i am always up for a trip to disneyland or maybe it is just a magical place to go in any case i think everyone should have an opportunity to visit it at least once in their lifetime obviously if you have a connection to anything disney you will most probably enjoy it more than others who don t i ve gone by myself with people who love it and people who think it is a waste of money definitely don t go with a party pooper this is a fun place but if you are with a penny pincher scrooge or complainer it will spoil your time send them someplace else or go when they can t ,5,2019-09-29
609,Be a kid all over again,we are in our sixties and had a blast a disney i was pleasantly surprised that there are a lot of couples there without children who want to be kids again themselves the new star wars exhibit is phenomenal we did the ride twice and we also enjoyed the old teacup ride with the other kids ,5,2019-09-29
610,Amazing experience for families!,we took our year old sons to dl california for the first time this year and we all had an awesome experience it was expensive especially with the poor aud to usd exchange rate however if you can afford it then it is worth it a few things to consider we had day park hopper tickets with maxpass the park hopper and maxpass are definitely worth the additional you can come and go as you please over the days and you don t need to worry about the of photos so you can have as many as you like and keep them all the fastpass is part of maxpass and is also very valuable because it saves so much time we stayed at the dl hotel see separate review which was fantastic because we could go back to the hotel for a rest when the kids needed it which they did it meant that we could be there when it opened go on rides before wait times got too long and also be there late at night for fireworks etc without the kids having to trudge around a busy park all day in the heat extra magic hour magic morning only small sections of the parks are open during this time so find out what they are and plan what you d like to do ahead of time get the app gives you wait times on all rides allows you to benefit most from maxpass and allows you to do mobile ordering from some of the eateries you order ahead of time then skip the queues and pick up your food during allocated window that you selected plan ahead a lot of the restaurants book out days in advance so use the app to make dining reservations ahead of time most places allow you to cancel up to hrs before the reservation without a fee so you can always change your mind if needed decide ahead of time how you are going to allocate your financial resources dl is an expensive place and there seem to be an infinite number of ways to spend money once you are inside the park decide whether you are going to take the approach of well we re here so let s enjoy it and not worry about the or whether you want to budget each day and stick to it deciding this will save a lot of arguments once you re in the park as a guide for a family of incl kids in the age range purchasing food only no souvenirs etc in the park you re probably up for around usd per day this will get you lunch dinner at the cheaper eateries ie burgers chips some snacks drinks ice cream you could decrease this by taking in your own food you can take as much food drink no alcohol into the parks as you like and there are lockers for storage be aware that the kids menu tends to be for kids up to yo only so once your kids are you re paying adult food prices parents need to be energised it is a hugely energy draining activity so plan to have some rest days don t try and do days in a row in the parks it will end up being unenjoyable we did days down day ie sit by pool and do nothing then days so all in all an expensive though absolutely fabulous experience for our family i hope some of this info helps you ,5,2019-09-28
611,Great fun with the multi-day park hopper pass with max pass,i have to say that with the max pass it saved us a lot of time being a combination of fast pass which saves time for standing in line and the photo pass which allows us to easily capture pictures and download them on the phone i feel that the max pass is the way to go and money well spent kids had a blast going to disneyland for the first time we will definitely go again ,4,2019-09-28
612,Classic fun,this was the first and is the classic the disneyland park is so family friendly and the california adventure park for older kids the halloween night was awesome with heaps of lollies candy the cast members are amazing and friendly the new star wars area was awesome and well done it has all the original magic and it s good to see that it keeps its key parts but also includes new and revamped rides and experiences ,5,2019-09-28
613,Truly magic but plan ahead,get the disneyland app on your phone and use it to plan prior to your big day out from union station in la to anaheim station on the orange metro line there is a free shuttle to disneyland to and from the station plus highly suggest to upgrade your ticket to include maxpass for fast pass the lineups and photo pass star wars ,5,2019-09-27
614,Amazing time other than Star Wars,had just an incredible time with our family star wars land didn t go great but the rest of the lands were amazing beautifully decorated for halloween ,5,2019-09-27
615,The magic continues,this was my first time to the park it was good fun as an adult going early beat the crowds which started to get heavy by am the disney experience was achieved the only disappointing thing was the haunted mansion broke after waiting in line for over half an hour it did start up later only to break down again did finaly go after grabing a fast pass it is good to grad a fast pass for one ride and then wait in line for another download the play app for wait times and other interactive things to conduct like scanning the cargo ing the star wars experience ,5,2019-09-26
616,First Time at Disney!,get there early like when it opens and get the express pass we did both and we re very glad we did ,4,2019-09-23
617,Unbelievable Senior Day (50+) at Disney,although we went to dca a few years ago it has been decades since going to disneyland just planned a one day visit and it was fantastic still cannot get over the attention to detail and superior customer service from the cast members was there from rope drop to close minus an hour at downtown disney for a quick dinner bite did not rush and took advantage of fastpass when we could plenty of people in the park but the longest wait without fastpass was around minutes for smuggler s run make sure to use the disneyland app it s a great source to find out wait times character schedules and mobile food ordering obviously still didn t see everything but that just means re visits parked at pixar pals and was a quick tram ride to the gate made sure to thank each cast member as we boarded and exited each ride nice to see and hear their reaction each time really enjoyed visiting with tony at pooh s gathering spot was very helpful in taking photos and answering any questions we had also the friends of the characters especially tigger was amazing the decorations for fall and halloween thru the park and the seasonal conversion of haunted mansion is unbelievable yes a visit to disney can be quite expensive however i would much rather spend the extra money to get fantastic service awesome experiences and great memories overall steps rides hours character meets parades and presentations made for a very magical day for a couple of year old kids ,5,2019-09-23
618,Happy Place,we loved galaxy s edge the artists and designers did an amazing job it felt like you were in another world looking forward to the new ride in january enjoyed all our favs too like pirates and haunted mansion we had a lot of fun in the magic kingdom ,5,2019-09-23
619,Disneyland Trip,parked at toy story lot with electric scooter we went and september sat sun did not wait to get on like the trams at parking garage recommend this parking stayed til midnight both days and bus wide open at night just walked on bag check was good brought in sealed drinks and ice in hydro flask this was a plus as some places have you dump ice out then smooth through gates military ticket so got paper copy at gate then got max pass basically fast pass on phone for both days if you get fantasmic then it locks one pic for day only get two at a time scan ticket into app then go for it between disability return times and fast pass we did great on rides food prices have gone up since our last trip years ago tried out one restaurant out on the strip of them near island waterfront it was chief style and wonderful they close at pm but will take you even with fantasmic about to start have two more days at christmas cannot wait happy place on earth ,4,2019-09-23
620,Always fun!,disneyland is a perpetual crowd pleaser they know how to make you love your stay and how to get you coming back over and over again there was a lot of construction going on but they can t exactly shut down every area that they work on and they will kindly direct you around it when needed the new land is gorgeous and immersive definitely a crowd pleaser if you have the funds for a visit ,5,2019-09-22
621,The best time EVER!,spent days at disney and could honestly not fault anything the park is immaculate the rides so much fun and there are plenty of food choices a must see with children ,5,2019-09-21
622,We love Disneyland!,we are a family of and we love disneyland my kids are all under the age of and its nice that they have ride to accommodate their age we love the fact that everything is so clean the cast members are friendly and super helpful and the food is fairly good only down side is that the tickets are so expensive ,4,2019-09-21
623,Old visitor,been going to disneyland since yes i ve seen allot of changes since yes some changes did take time to adjust but those changes improved older rides only thing of concern is bob iger he needs to move on and that employees receive better pay and benefits,5,2019-09-21
624,This review is for Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run Ride in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland Park,the concept of the millennium falcon smugglers run ride is great six people crew the millennium falcon and we are given a role as either pilot gunner or engineer the problem is how the positions are assigned it is not random if you have six people in your group you will be fine however for us on both occasions when we rode both as a couple and then as single riders one of the pilot positions was given to a youngling who clearly was too small and too young to operate the controls thus ruining the experience for the rest of us one youngling did not speak or understand english that is to be expected given that people from all over the word travel to disneyland to enjoy the younglings were not tall enough to see over the dashboard so they could not even begin to figure out the video additionally and one of them was so young they could not follow simple directions like left right or up down younglings are perfectly capable of maneuvering the joystick up or down on dumbo or steering the cars on autopia cast members should remember when passing out the tickets what this experience is meant to be not crashing and burning and having the ride end after only obtaining one canister for the resistance ,2,2019-09-20
625,Star Wars amazing!Park super!,was so excited to see this park and spend time on n the star wars area was not dissapointed totally immersive the ride was underwhelming but the whole park atmosphere was spot on including the characters roaming around don t miss this one,5,2019-09-20
626,Bad Disneyland Food,i love to go to disneyland but their food is not very good i know that but yesterday was the last straw on eating in the park it tasted poorly and today my stomach is feeling bloated and keeping me from going out just a warning it is better to eat in downtown disney or bring your food with you with the prices they charge i would expect better from disneyland it seems to me to be getting worse again i love disneyland but hate their food ,1,2019-09-19
627,Girls trip ages20-55,quick two day trip one day in each park really fun during the halloween season still hot weather and still very busy although any time before am was pretty good to access rides always super clean and friendly disney promotes manners the new star wars galaxy land is incredible in detail the new millennium falcon ride was interesting but a bit underwhelming it s hard to take in everything in one day even when the day is hours long but the regular stars of indiana jones pirates of the caribbean splash mtn and the haunted mansion especially during the nightmare before christmas season are excellent the park is very fall festive some thematic food is available souvenirs t shirts etc and characters though tricky to find and catch a picture with are often dressed for halloween as well i missed the sit down performances that used to be more prevalent however it seems more of these are now at california adventures for canadians it is now about a day for a lot of standing in line the exchange rate really hurts so it would be nice to see some incentives to help even that out and make it a pinch more affordable for families also there are very few actual vegetarian food options many items such as swampy fries or even salads have sausage or bacon thrown in it would be great if these dishes could just leave out the meat products universal has a veggie corn dog get with the times disney ,5,2019-09-19
628,A fun park to visit,this was my first visit to a disney theme park and it was a lot of fun the staff are very helpful the rides are entertaining and the shops attractions interesting to see the days got quite warm but there was always somewhere with air conditioning that offered a cool break it was fun to get pictures taken with various disney characters as well though the rides were fun i can t say it is worth waiting more than minutes to go on them i went on the single rider lineups or use the fast pass option and had minimal waits the food in the park was rather expensive paying for convenience so i opted for a big breakfast at my hotel and a larger dinner once i left the park ,5,2019-09-18
629,Disneyland Visit,we visited disneyland on two separate visits during our week stay in anaheim we usually do a vip trip to universal studios but thought because of the new addition of star wars galaxy s edge we would give disney a second chance whilst the atmosphere is not quite there yet there were noticeable improvements made on most of the rides the cantina in star wars galaxy s edge is a must ,5,2019-09-18
630,Disney!,suspend your adulthood embrace your inner child and enjoy from the moment the park opens until the fireworks finish your night off perfectly oh and wear comfortable shoes ,5,2019-09-18
631,"Lots of fun, but second to Disney World",the rides at this park are great and head to head comparison between them and the same rides at disney world has disneyland winning most of the time however there really is a lot more to do at disney world and the cast members are much better trained and provide much better customer service than most that i encountered at disneyland i m still giving it stars because after all it s disney ,5,2019-09-17
632,A return visit after almost 60 years.,i spent my th birthday at disneyland when it has just opened this return visit was months prior to my th birthday i was traveling alone but still thoroughly enjoyed my day at disney ,5,2019-09-17
633,Happiest Place on Earth,the park is great to walk around and you can generally get into the shows the kid rides and some of the simulator rides most of the other rides always had long wait times the light show and fireworks display was simply amazing well worth going back in the evening to see those ,5,2019-09-17
634,Lots to see but wait times for rides are too long,my wife nephew and i spent two days enjoying all the rides and attractions at this magical place our main focus was galaxy s edge as we wanted to ride the millennium falcon spaceship we were not disappointed the wait for the ride was only minutes the first day and minutes the next day while at ge my wife accosted a storm trooper who demanded to see her id great fun in tomorrowland we were able to get pictures with darth vader and chewy one of the highlights was the light parade after dusk a must see event mickey and miinnie were frequently seen dancing and waving to the crowd be prepared to walk a lot as we covered nearly miles the first day overlooked but worth the time was the lincoln theater where a life like lincoln speaks many of his great thoughts also take the train ride around the park to get a feel for the lay of the land a wonderful experience at a special place ,3,2019-09-17
635,Great place for family fun,this place never gets old even if you visit for the hundredth time i visited again because i wanted to see the new star wars galaxy s edge and even though some rides are still closed disney still delivered you are really transported to a different place made the ticket pricier but it is definitely worth it wasn t able to try any of the food outlets at star wars because it was always packed but eating anywhere in disney will satisfy anyone anyway ,4,2019-09-16
636,Disneyland only gets better!,we knew that the second ride in this part of disneyland hadn t opened yet and wouldn t be open until january but we couldn t wait to explore the new star wars land so went in september the one ride smuggler s run is amazing get in the pilot s seat and be prepared to work steering either up and down or back and forth i was a gunner so seated in the second seat behind the pilots i hit the buttons when i was supposed to and dared to look occasionally though my motion sickness potential prevented my watching consistently they did an amazing job with this ride and i would certainly go again and try to glance up more the world they created batuu is other worldly and fascinating we really enjoyed exploring all the bits of it and returned in the evening to see it lit up oga s cantina you can get a reservation days before or easily the morning you go in the park on the disney app is a blast the drinks are delicious and generously alcoholic if you wish and the atmosphere festive we could have done with a few aliens wandering about or sitting at the bar that would have added to it we had lunch at the docking station delicious chicken salads but the ribs looked good too overall an amazing experience ,5,2019-09-16
637,This review is about Star Wars Land: Galaxy's Edge,i love the disney parks they are great for all ages disneyland has excellent food the night time shows are amazing can t wait to go back ,5,2019-09-15
638,Lives up to the hype - absolutely wonderful!,never disappointing and does not matter what age you are everyone has heard of it and it is worth going to ,5,2019-09-15
639,Won't be my last visit.,what can i say i love this place it s truly magical the park is always clean the landscaping is flawless staff are courteous the food was never far away when you wanted it everything is well laid out i have so many amazing memories with the family here the ticket price had gone up when i visited i think roughly aud but worth absolutely every cent i didn t wait more than minutes for any ride and most were a walk up to and jump on this place was better than i expected a must visit ,5,2019-09-14
640,Disneyland fun,love going to disneyland for the fireworks the new land has an amazing view but no music i like it that way but people near me wanted the music i just pretended that i was watching a space battle ,5,2019-09-13
641,Love love love....,disneyland resort is everything you would expect from disney its a happy place with fun rides and many characters i travelled with my autistic son whom had special assistance with waiting in queues which made this holiday extremely enjoyable for him and us employees were very happy food was great and healthy but very expensive characters were everywhere and it wasnt hard to get a picture and autograph the queues were not long at all we managed about rides in the day the fireworks projections and electrical parade were amazing i cannot fault this park in any way it was a holiday of a lifetime ,5,2019-09-13
642,Disappointing,very disappointed with this visit souvenir s overpriced compared to buying similar items in a store the park is a lot smaller than expected and we left mid afternoon felt like a huge waste of money the rides are ok but universal s rides are more thrilling for all those smokers vapers out there disney does not allow smoking inside the park you must leave the park through gates then wait in lines again to enter the park ,3,2019-09-12
643,Very nice place,this was our first time to disney in california and it was great last year we went to orlando and it was really nice california had great parks attractions space and wonderful nice and helpful staff allover ,4,2019-09-11
644,Rude and Unhelpful Ticket Booth Staff,went to exchange my virgin holidays voucher for x park tickets that i had paid a lot of money for when i handed my voucher to the person in the ticket booth he spent a good couple of minutes examining it and typing some stuff into his computer when i asked if there was a problem his reply was i can t find your reservation i asked why and his reply was your voucher is incomplete i replied that the voucher was intact correct and it was the only thing that i had been issued with by virgin holidays his reply to this was well you have choices ring your tour operator or buy new tickets to this i said i want to speak to your supervisor after a minute wait a supervisor came over and basically told me that my voucher was incomplete and there was nothing she could do i then phoned virgin holidays in the uk at a large expense to myself and told them the situation to which virgin holidays said that it was very strange that disney was not accepting the voucher as it is the same voucher that they give to s of british visitors every year i offered to give my phone to the supervisor so she could explain the situation directly to my tour operator but she abruptly told me she could not handle visitors personal items so she wouldn t speak to virgin holidays after a lot of back and forth via the speaker on my phone it turned out that apparently i was missing an number i explained this to virgin and they stated that they never provide an number on their vouchers after approx another minutes the supervisor decided to tap some keys on her computer and hey presto she discovered the required number by using the information provided on my voucher i finally got my tickets but after a lot of phone calls back to the uk and an approx hour wait all this could of been avoided if the original ticket booth operator and his supervisor could actually be bothered to do their job properly and not just try and fob me off because it was a little bit different or difficult for them to do also when i stated that the voucher i had was exactly the same type of voucher i had when i went to disney world in florida and i had no problems the supervisor replied and i quote i don t care this is california not florida rude beyond belief disney you need to get a grip of your staffs attitude,1,2019-09-11
645,Disney and California Adventure,we always love disneyland and california adventure for a little variety great fun found it best early and late we stayed there all day for the lines though gettine a quick pass for the most popular rides is best early don t even bother gettin a quick pass for the roller coaster late at night as that line is longer than the regular line ,5,2019-09-10
646,Trip,best time with family my kids have fun it was nice to see and people was nice you can bring kids on some rids,5,2019-09-10
647,It’s Disneyland,this is the best place to go with or without kids yes there are lines but it s a lot of fun the cast members know what to do to keep you smiling and it s super easy to just let go and have a blast if you ve never been save up and get going ,5,2019-09-10
648,Disney. Heaven on Earth,so not much i can say about disney other than it is magical since age i have loved this place and i now continue to tradition with my kids ,5,2019-09-10
649,Wow,first time visit and it was amazing truly is the happiest place on earth was worried that the wait times would be long but they weren t there are a lot of companies that could learn from disney ,5,2019-09-09
650,My happy place,hurricane dorian foiled our plans for a week long vacation in orlando s disney world if we can t visit the mouse on the east coast we ll just go west i ve been to disney world numerous times and was thrilled to find that disneyland ca adventure offered new to me rides and attractions the parks were immaculate as always the crowds were pretty low making for a very fun day jam packed with rides i especially enjoyed galaxy s edge which i hadn t seen yet ,5,2019-09-09
651,Galaxy’s Edge,spent two great days here visiting the two parks although we went primarily to see the new star wars land i have got to say very impressed with pixar pier ,5,2019-09-09
652,Star Wars!!!,just amazing our second time here both times have been in september and both times had very small lines we even went on the smugglers run and all the other star wars rides twice ,5,2019-09-09
653,It really is the happiest place on earth,was totally blown away by this place when visiting with our and year olds the staff were all amazing helpful professional and well trained the shear numbers through the gate on an hourly basis and everything runs like clockwork plenty of stuff for all age groups everything always spotless the phone app is awesome and security is taken seriously all in all an amazing experience would definitely go again and i can now understand what all the hype is about ,5,2019-09-09
654,Looking at these reviews and I shake my head.,disneyland park is iconic and also a must do in southern california star wars galaxy s edge is super cool and the indiana jones ride is so great ,5,2019-09-08
655,Iconic,my adult daughter and the rest of our adult family were leaving the cars ride and walking down the stairway which was poorly lit she fell and twisted her ankle and was unable to walk she needed ice and a wheelchair we got her outside and she sat while i asked many service attendants for assistance i was told at the closest restaurant they were low on ice and could not give me any one employee called security and they said they could not send a nurse we had to come to the front of the park and fetch a wheelchair and were charged thirty dollars to use it i was going from restaurant to restaurant trying to get ice in a plastic bag for her ankle the experience was terrible not one disneyland employee helped us,5,2019-09-08
656,Fun day where you can let your inner child play,great fun suspend reality and let your inner child have some fun can get a bit boring waiting in lines for rides but if you go at times when the crowds are smaller then this problem is reduced like everything similar they know how to separate you from your dollars so beware the impulse buy ,5,2019-09-07
657,Really is the happiest place on Earth!,we visited both disneyland parks on our recent trip to the us and it was amazing i don t think anyone would be able to set foot in the parks and not enjoy themselves from the minute we arrived we realised that there was truly nothing that they hadn t thought of we particularly liked the mobile app which was so handy especially with it s ability to display current wait times for each ride we spent day at the adventure park this one was our favourite and managed to go on all of the rides we had planned we stopped at the lamplight lounge for a drink and the view across the water was lovely and then made a stop at all of the gift shops for a quick look and a few purchases for myself day we spent at the original park which was just as amazing however we were disappointed with the lack of princesses and characters walking around i guess you have to be in the right place at the right time the rides were fantastic especially the older ones which gave us more of a thrill than we were expecting we had a huge slice of pizza at alien pizza planet which was a really clever joint and then found a good place to watch the electrical parade and the fireworks which topped off a really enjoyable two days for us we left with a smile from ear to ear the admission prices were a bit high like any other theme park but i d pay it again in a heartbeat to spend a bit more time there definitely add both parks to your list also on a side note our accommodation was in hollywood but we ended up packing a backpack and finding a motel in anaheim where we spent the night in between our two days at disney this ended up being a terrific idea as it saved nearly two hours in traffic and allowed us to get up nice and early on the second day i d definitely recommend staying in anaheim for the duration of your disney visits if you can ,5,2019-09-07
658,Woohoo!!!,what can i say it s disneyland me and my son came from canada and a day pass was about canadian you got a lot for it though not just rides there are parades and shows characters lots of cool features to see the food is obviously overpriced and not fantastic and there s a lot of repetition churros everywhere i would definitely go back again but probably in a couple years i am disneyed out ride lines weren t too bad we use the fastpass for the really popular rides and walked on the rest waiting no longer than about a half hour when we went that route bring a water bottle for sure ,5,2019-09-06
659,Magical,the moment we entered disneyland park it felt so magical it took me back to the old mickey mouse clubhouse episodes the park provides rides to all age groups we fell in love with disney adventure i suggest to download disneyland park app to skip long rides wait different restaurants available at the site that suits different tastes fireworks at night were really magical ,5,2019-09-06
660,Dreams do come true,waited over years to get here and did not disappoint the little girl inside of me the smile never left me face over the hours spent here it was a hot day for sure but rode every ride i could and was totally happy all day it s a place for young and old i would ve loved to have brought my family here when they were younger but alas the cost from australia plus other costs as well as being a single income family years ago prevented that if you can do it with your school aged kids do it ,5,2019-09-06
661,Disneyland Vacation,we spent days in disneyland and had a wonderful time lines on friday and monday were short even with longer lines on saturday and sunday by using fast passes we were able to get through lines easily not as many shows as disneyworld and food selection smaller but so is the park ,4,2019-09-06
662,Galaxies Edge was more than we imagined.,having grown up in southern california we visited disneyland dozens of times over the years but recently we have moved to arizona and on vacation we went back to visit the new galaxies edge area of the park we were concerned because there was news that it wasn t living up to disney s expectations but we were blown away by all of the details and the realism of the star wars world they have created we got to spend part of our time with a friend who had been a part of the team who did all of the theming and she showed us details we would have missed the millenium falcon ride was incredible and we rode it multiple times they move people through it a lot faster than you would expect the only minor disappointment was with the cantina the drinks were sub par the only snack they had was terrible and most people had to stand since the ratio of people to booths out of balance overall though we loved the new addition to the park and will definitely return ,5,2019-09-06
663,Excellent theme park,i was in disneyland with some friends for my birthday this year and really enjoyed my time we spent three days there really good weather and service as i have special needs,5,2019-09-05
664,Worth it every time,this is my third disney them park i ve visited and the magic is always there although is smaller than the one in orlando it has all it s wonder the rides are amazing the characters are always the to meet you and the parade was beautiful and now with star wars galaxy s edge is definitely something you can t miss ,5,2019-09-05
665,Great trip,glad to be back at disneyland such a magical place rode the new millennium falcon ride times never waited more than minutes ,5,2019-09-05
666,the place where cames back the child you have inside,a magic place where you would like to stay forever you can forget all the sadness and the adults become children suggested the upgrade to max pass because you can use the fast pass to avoid the lines and you can download all the pictures the professionals take you while you walk around the park the best solution arriving there early in the morning when it opens to taka advantage of the attractions,5,2019-09-05
667,Fantastic!!!!!,we went for a quick two day visit we enjoyed every minute we love disneyland and this trip reinforced that feeling the new star wars land was awesome the new tweaks to space mountain were great we also had great food in the park the one minus was the ridiculous prices disney charges for gift shop merchandise i guess someone has to pay for the new star wars land a dollar hooded sweatshirt will help pay the bills i highly recommend going to disneyland for a fantastic experience however avoid the gift shops and save your money ,5,2019-09-05
668,A fun day out,i watched disney videos to decide the rides and attractions that i could choose from and had a great time transportation from the hotel was inexspensice and timely ,5,2019-09-04
669,Walt's Original - Great Charm!,we were becoming huge disneyland fans we live in orlando each visit has something special we hadn t seen before park is kept clean love the attractions that are not in orlando or are different ,5,2019-09-04
670,Great place to be,we ve been ther in may the weather wasn t good ther was no firwork an only a small parade cause of the rain we loved it to see the original disneyland park everthing was fine ,5,2019-09-04
671,First Time Visit,enjoyed our visit much smaller than wdw which was nice able to see everything and enjoy the rides in one day we don t have small children so it was easier for us but even if you do have children i think you could enjoy yourselves with a day trip plenty of places to sit and rest good food if you don t mind riding alone use the single rider line saves a ton of time and met some nice people ,5,2019-09-03
672,February visit,february was a good time to visit less crowded than other times of the year wish the cost was less however to get the disney experience you will pay will come back ,5,2019-09-03
673,Family Vacation,this was the most magical trips to disneyland ever my wife just finished chemo and all she wanted to do was to go to disneyland with the family wow just wow they were so nice to start my wife had energy so we rented a scooter it was easy to rent and maneuvered around the park with ease the staff was beyond incredible hearing that she was worried about losing energy waiting in lines they helped us book our entire day they booked us rides character meet and greets things to do with downtime and even recommend restaurants at different parts of the park the meet and greet with mickey mouse was i can t even put it in words but i ll try it was the most perfect and magical character meet ever i ve been coming to disneyland every year for almost years it got really emotional in that room honestly everyone was in tears even the photographer they made my wife feel so good that she took a picture with mickey without her wig on my wifes head was just as shiny as mickey s ears i say that with love disneyland always says that they want everyone to have a good time yes even the parents they really mean it if you have any illnesses like cancer children with special needs a disability etc even kids who get out of control in long lines they will work with you ,5,2019-09-03
674,Star wars is Awesome!,had an amazing time with family did a day park hopper disney one day and ca adventure the next so much fun and the wait times weren t too bad ,5,2019-09-03
675,I liked Disney World much better,i felt like i wasted my money some rides weren t working plus they closed certain areas early due to fireworks it was small and we only saw about characters i would pass if you have teenagers,3,2019-09-03
676,a bit expensive but fun,we have kids so its a pricey adventure compare to when i was a kid i wish they had more special pricing the kids love it obviously lots of walking get you comfortable shoes on because you will average miles a day ,4,2019-09-03
677,A fun day at the Park,i had my daughter for the summer vacation and we decided to go to disneyland because she wanted to see galaxy s edge we had a great time flying the millennium falcon and exploring all of the stores this new land is a lot of fun if you are a big star wars fan we are the interactive app was fun as we discovered the easter eggs throughout the park while waiting in line we got to listen to songs and play trivia games all in all we had a great time and was welcome break from adulthood and safe place to be a kid again ,5,2019-09-03
678,Magical time at Disney,had a great days at disney spent days in the theme park explored almost every attraction star wars land is looking great with more to come think ahead for the galaxys edge ride single rider option can be as slow as the main line enjoyed the fireworks and its a small world in particular ,5,2019-09-03
679,Family trip to Disneyland,we had a great time in disneyland and really enjoyed the new star wars area the only negative comment has to do with the numerous temporary ride closures that occurred throughout the day that made it difficult to see and do everything in one area before heading of to another area ,4,2019-09-03
680,The Magic continues!!!,been to disneyland disney paris and disney world adding the star wars edge is a great addition making a few changes in future land to accommodate star wars is a plus hyperspace ride is a great upgrade from space mountain good thing with disney california it s less crowded and easier to get in ride compare to disney world i recommend getting the disney app and paying the extra for max pass gets you the fast pass and also photos ,4,2019-09-02
681,Fun time with family - Vegan food options appreciated,we enjoyed our recent visit to disneyland taking advantage of the indoor air conditioned shows during the hottest part of the day we also took advantage of the vegan options offered throughout the park locations and offerings can be found by doing a google search or by asking the food establishment if they have a vegan substitution it s nice to have options when needed and the food was delicious complimentary ice water is also available at most sit down locations just ask thanks disney for keeping us well fed hydrated and cool ,5,2019-09-02
682,Disneyland,what can i say a theme park on steriods it was very peopley but other than being squished everywhere we went i had a blast and didnt want to leave ,5,2019-09-02
683,Felt like a kid again!,this was my first time at disneyland i ve never been a big fan of amusement parks but disney made me a believer i felt like a kid again purchased a three day park hopper thursday was the least crowded but still not bad for friday or saturday the park was very clean and the staff was just as great as you expect disney cast members to be lines were never too long i would definitely recommend the fastpass for at least one day of your visit ,5,2019-09-01
684,Summer get away,nice visit not to crowded lines weren t bad monorail was shut down down between am to pm warm temperatures very minimal attraction shut down or breaking down nice souvenirs park was clean lots of cast members able to assist you,5,2019-09-01
685,Not to be missed,the original disney park and a must see it s more suited to younger children but still a fun visit for all the food options aren t exceptional but the overall experience is still fabulous max pass is worth it if you want to do a lot of rides and do use the app base case and also allows you to get unlimited pictures remember to get the ones done round the park as well as those on the rides the new star wars area is overhyped and for some reason there is no fast pass available on the ride which is a shame ,5,2019-08-31
686,Fun time had by all,we took three toddlers for their first visit to disneyland they thoroughly enjoy the breakfast with various characters and the rides the food at the park was marginal and expensive water stations and restrooms were hard to find the park staff was very knowledgeable and helpful ,4,2019-08-30
687,Needs Love,just visited disneyland from am pm the much hyped star wars land was a waste of time i know you must experience to believe it but after hours at the park we were in star wars land for exactly minutes and that was just to wait ride the new ride it is clear parts of the attraction were not finished and hopefully more is coming space mountain is a better star wars experience splash mountain delivers more thrill even it s a small world held our attention better interesting that the past is better than the future max pass is highly questionable as you only get two photos from rides space mountain and splash mountain buzz lightyear offers you an emailed picture but that is the worst do it just to see how bad the main st electrical parade must be cut down if you go on a weekday outside of summer it might have been minutes long at most i ll return in a decade if not longer not impressed with the direction disneyland is going per adult max pass per adult brought our own food do not expect a quality meal at disneyland ,2,2019-08-29
688,Walt Disney’s Dream Come True,as annual pass holder s for many years and southern california senior residents we enjoy disneyland for many reasons most recently we experienced a fun performance by the navy band southwest nd street band in the royal theater when lines are not long we go on rides and most always ride the astro blasters if you are going to disneyland only once in your lifetime and it is at a busy time we highly recommend paying big bucks for a vip tour you will have a plaid guide take you to all the most popular rides and your wait time will be shorter there is a lot to say about walt disneyland dream park but this review will end with arrive early stay late and don t miss the spectacular fireworks and parade ,5,2019-08-29
689,Son first time to Disneyland,my daughter loved splash mountain people are helpful lots of places to eat the lines were long great place to have fun,5,2019-08-28
690,The most fun!,we have visited disney parks every year since our kids were young this disneyland park is so much fun a day admittance may be expensive to some but with the amount of rides shows parades and fireworks it is well worth it come early and stay late the max pass is new and worth every penny ,5,2019-08-28
691,MaxPass a must,after spending a fortune on the tickets this is a small price to pay for an absolute must not only will you gain hours by not queuing you will save money not having to buy the photos if you want them as you can just download them from the code the app is also really useful at checking waiting times booking fast passes also if you have a mixed aged group or no little ones get the park hopper ticket and also go to california adventure park which is fun and also sells beer the park itself is a lot smaller than disney world in florida but worth the trip ,3,2019-08-27
692,Florida Disney is way bigger and better value!!! Never returning!,once in a lifetime trip so the kids can see california and disneyland they wanted to see cars land so bad as only in cali we made the trip for family to see disney then head to legoland disneyland is ok definitely a two day max trip family of two boys stayed at hojo which was great price and worked out well disneyland had up and down professionalism from staff some great staff were kenny at toy story awesome very friendly give him a raise helped us out but some bad were derek and cameron at cars very rude they would let fastpass in and then tops regular line our initial wait time was minutes we actually waited minutes to get on ride those staff were even ignorant and rude when asked why fast pass get thru and only regular line a scam to sell fast passes retrain or fire these workers very rude not professional ignorant workers many many people in line were pissed they tailor to the few and ruin vacation for majority i m not the boss or ceo but i know how to manage train and professionalize thousands of workers anyhow we won t ever visit disneyland california ever again very small park can get thru california adventure and main park one day each easily the florida parks plus waterpark hopper deal is times better for the value the workers are also more professional ,2,2019-08-27
693,Great experience!,we met family there and spent most of the day we were disappointed that we missed the opening of star wars ,4,2019-08-27
694,Dream come true,simply awesome it was a dream come true the rides the shows you name it and you won t be disappointed it has two parks and you would want to keep two days in your hand to cover those you can still cover the parks in one day but it will be tiresome and you would like to enjoy spending time there the parade mickey mouse laser show the fire works it was simply worth it the place that i ended up visiting times and yet i would not mind going back again ,5,2019-08-27
695,Great but expensive!,disneyland is a classic but unless you have a lot of money it has gotten too expensive over per person to get in then add pp to get fast pass access a few bits of food also expensive and it can spoil the experience however we got in for very reduced prices this day and it was terrific the fast pass free is mandatory on a day that is crowded or the waits are way too long this theme park is really geared for young ones and they do have a fantastic time here if you are looking for big rides and good roller coasters go somewhere else like kings dominion in virginia recommended for the disney set ,5,2019-08-27
696,Star Wars has 5 stars the rest -1,this park is outdated over expensive and boring not well maintained but star wars galaxy edge makes it worth while to visit the only location in the park that was really crowded i would advise all americans when you have to chance to visit the netherlands go visit themepark de efteling you will be amazed compared with disney,2,2019-08-27
697,MAGICAL,what an amazing place me and my wife spent the day here and wished we had more time the park is large with lots to explore and see even with large crowds it was comfortable and lines moved quickly everything appeared clean and new each ride had so much attention to detail to make you feel like you were in a disney movie highlight make sure you watch the night fireworks above the disney castle it was amazing to watch hard to fault this place ten out of ten ,5,2019-08-26
698,A Different Kind of Magic,just about everything has already been said about disneyland but my impression is that it is as magical a place as could be created outside of the larger world in florida we visited in early august on a wednesday and thursday we got maxpasses and that made all the difference we arrived at rope drop before the gates opened on both days and were able to enjoy lots of rides before they got crowded everyone runs to the back of the park to ride smugglers run millennium falcon first and that is sound advice we waited only minutes when we got out the wait was and it climbed to shortly thereafter the ride was a blast especially since my son was the pilot and got to make the coveted jump to light speed he also visited the droid depot with no wait and built a really cool droid of course they were sold out of lots of the accessories that were available when the park opened even many of the cool toys were nowhere to be found the storm troopers were really fun and joked around when the droid starting spontaneously making noise really cool other tips if you build a droid take it to the store near the first order area and they will deliver it to the stroller rental at the front of the park so you don t have to haul it around with you people say the wifii is spotty and they are correct but if you have at t your cellular plan will cover the gaps max pass was a huge help i made of them in one day and saved hours in line once we checked in on big thunder mountain the wait with fp was minutes v without it amazing mobile ordering was nice but not needed on anything except for the tikki dole whip stand photopass was free but wouldn t have been worth paying for there weren t enough people available to take our pictures i was surprised at how painful the matterhorn was to ride and how much better the pirates of the caribbean was as compared to florida disneyland is quite simply a different park that presents different challenges different reservation games and even some different rides once you learn what to expect the magic and pixie dust is just as plentiful as florida ,5,2019-08-26
699,Refused Special Needs Pass,my autistic son was at disneyland today and was refused a special needs pass he has been getting such a pass at both disneyland and disney world for many years i have no idea why danielle refused his pass today my wife and i were outside the park and danielle refused to talk to us on the phone he had a doctors note and it is very apparent when you interact with him that he is autistic and has special needs i hope daniele is feeling good about refusing to give him a pass this is not the disney i know,1,2019-08-26
700,Ups and Downs,very expensive but still a decent day out the one thing that this park does better than magic kingdom is that fast passes come out that day in the morning and not months earlier we have been to florida and not been able to get a fast pass for rides such as flight of passage because people book them up from home months in advance but the doesn t happen in the california parks the one thing that the california parks need though are the magic bands they work so well in florida i have no idea why they don t use them in california took a star off because galaxys edge is so bad ,4,2019-08-26
701,Adults take on Disneyland,loved disneyland smaller than disney world with few different rides employees always making sure visitors are happy and ready to give advise or help will definitely return ,5,2019-08-26
702,Don’t so it if you have children right at height!,every worker is different your child can be at but their opinion can be different off by a hair one will check and let you in the next one after waiting minutes says no disneyland is a waste of time will not be renewing our annual passes same for all of my large family and friends way too many bad experiences friendliest place on earth not any more by far ,1,2019-08-25
703,"Galaxy’s Edge is great, minus Oga’s Cantina",i visited disneyland at the end of august the crowds were manageable and lots of shaded areas to rest on a degree day i visited galaxy s edge and it was great the only disappointment was oga s cantina i never got a reservation for any time and i started looking weeks out they should offer a min tour to look inside for those who don t have to drink smuggler s run tip go through regular line to experience the droids and backside of the falcon the first time and then take single line the rest of your runs i was able to go times and wait time for single was less then minutes ,4,2019-08-25
704,Somewhat different than Magic Kingdom in FL,even though there are like rides similar to rides in magic kingdom fl they differ enough to make the trip to disneyland enjoyable and different for example space mountain in ca is called hyperspace mountain based off star wars and sits per row and is listed as one of my favorites ahead of the fl space mountain ,4,2019-08-24
705,too expensive,it is too expensive there are more things to spend your money on than there are rides for you to enjoy that you already spent your hard earned money on a bottle of water is by itself but it is so hot that you don t have a choice good luck finding a restroom they seemed to be far and few between the max pass was great but it booked out for hours and you don t get many photos ,3,2019-08-24
706,Go early,an all time great full of memories and lines unlike disney world disneyland is a locals park so go early because the locals show up around am and they stay to the bitter end,5,2019-08-24
707,"Good park, not quite as good as Disneyworld",been to disneyworld many times so this our first family trip to disneyland was a chance to compare the two this park is smaller than the magic kingdom in disneyworld which makes it easier to get around many rides are the same some better hyperspace mountain pirates iasw some worse splash should be called drench mountain astro orbiters of the unique rides the matterhorn was a bit underwhelming not to mention bumpy though my daughter enjoyed it more than i did galaxy s edge was also disappointing the sets are great but the ride was only really fun for the pilots and i pity the engineers who can hardly see anything out the front and have little to do the boarding pass entry system wasn t in operation when we were there and the ride isn t part of the fastpass system so you have to wait in line usually for a long time the indiana jones ride a rebadged version of the dinosaur ride in florida is exciting the jungle cruise corny and there s a mary poppins horse on the carousel which my daughter loved toad s wild ride and the alice ride were also good for the young at heart the park is easy to walk to from nearby hotels which is good as parking is expensive and not very close bag search can be slow so try not to take a bag food is ok but overpriced and you should definitely use mobile ordering we used maxpass on a couple of days where you can book fastpasses from your phone they still have the paper ticket based system that was replaced at disneyworld by the wrist bands it means you don t have to walk to the attraction to get the fastpass but it is pricey dollars per person per day on our trip it does give you access to fastpasses in both parks though which is a real time saver and sometimes you are allowed to book another before the first one is used but usually you can only hold one at a time also you have to be in one of the parks before you can start using the system overall it s a good park but not quite as good as the magic kingdom in disneyworld but it is disney and you know what you re going to get ,4,2019-08-23
708,"Highs, lows and everything in between",been to disneyworld a bunch and third time to disneyland i would say with any disney visit depending on who is working when you go etc it tends to be a mixed bag for the most part it is very good but here and there you find a few things that could use improvement pros this time around were the electrical parade dining package character meeting and toontown meeting characters at disneyland was relatively easy as several characters had their own designated spots and or moved around enough you could find them without the app found the characters spent ample time with each person which can be a pro and a con it was more of a con at ca adventure the dining package for the electrical parade was more than worth it the food was good the restaurant was well run and the access to the parade was perfect but best to be on the earlier arrival time toontown is a cute area and lots of opportunities to find characters there the restaurant for the fantasmic dining package the river belle had good food a great atmosphere and decent service but the show experience was a con will mention in a minute some of the cons were thinking we had a reserved spot for fantasmic and that timing entry no matter if you enter the reserved area on the earlier or later side would be fine wrong if you enter on the later side your choices for seating are limited they would not allow you to sit back on ledges and everyone was squished sitting on the ground with strollers in the area obstructing views although for the most part the show was too much for a smaller kid with the sounds and effects so we actually ended up skipping out and previewing the electrical parade which is a must do as the parade is for everyone in the family another con was trying to grab food quickly from the hungry bear before fantasmic the line was terrible and disorganized and the wait for food was very long for quick service someone in line started asking for management and making it clear that this was unacceptable it was definately not the disney way you would expect as the service was disorganized there was confusion about food orders which window to go to which made for unhappy and stressed guests of the places we ate in the parks this was definately the worst experience dining another issue we came across was rides would shut down intermittently we had finally got our kid on a few rides when we headed to small world and the app had a min wait it suddenly was closed with technical issues well that ended rides for us across both parks with staff it depended who you encountered you might encounter some going above and beyond calling kids princess and acting in various roles while others do not put much effort into the experience all in all it was a fun experience but my view would be dont go into any disney trip expecting perfection expect a mixed bag and you will have more fun especially if something exceeds your expectation i know that is the attitude i will have in the future on trips ,4,2019-08-22
709,The Happiest Place in the World,i visited disneyland with my husband and two beautiful children ages and and our experience was amazing i was blown away at how much my children enjoyed the park rides meeting the characters and watching all the shows the kids kept hugging and kissing my husband and i to thank us for bringing them to disneyland as it is the happiest place on earth i found the age to a great age for the kids as my son was able to go on some of the more exciting rides as he just passed inches cm they especially loved the big thunder roller coaster and splash mountain what i liked about disneyland was that everything was included there were no extra costs for kids to play go on rides or do activities meeting the characters was fun initially my kids were reserved and hesitant however every character we met took the time to talk to the kids give a unique compliment and ask questions this helped the kids to feel comfortable and take amazing photos also if you take an autograph book each of the characters will happily sign the book for you the kids loved this and were speaking about how many autographs they got and i was thrilled to have the memorable photos each of the characters does an amazing job at staying in character and their sidekicks are friendly and happy the disneyland app was wonderful it literally is everything that is happening in the park we could see how long wait time for rides are then target the rides with shorter wait times i believed this helped us to fit more rides in during our visit also it gives show and character time and locations as well as dining options the wi fi is disappointing at times while waiting in the queue as we had no reception in certain areas the fantasmic night time spectacular event was phenomenal we were all blown away by the lights and storyline we also loved the show mickey and the magical map this was such a great show for the kids and adults with a wonderful lesson for all of us remember i feel privileged and am grateful to have had the opportunity to have taken the children to disneyland the park has truly thought of all the little details such as reducing wait time on rides by having people organised the staff and characters do an amazing job at truly making this the happiest place on earth ,5,2019-08-22
710,Lived up to expectations,we went to disneyland because galaxy s edge was opening there before the summer ended and we had a wonderful time we are not a disney obsessed family but we still had a lot of fun i d recommend hyperspace mountain the millennium falcon ride and splash mountain in particular i would say matterhorn bobsleds pirates of the caribbean and finding nemo were overrated and missable tips everyone says it s so much smaller than disneyworld in fl and that s true but i would still get a day pass with park hopper privileges even with packed days we didn t do everything the day pass gets you the magic morning too the disneyland app is fantastic download it get to know it use it the mobile dining option and ride times alone are worth downloading it the maxpass is a add on per ticket that s for a family of over days get it anyway the photo pass part is awesome and the fast pass options make for a trip with minimal lines worth the price get a hotel within walking distance that way you can come and go so you can take breaks especially in the summer when crowds and heat can make you crazy bring a dry bag for water rides bring your own water and snacks bring a portable charger for your phone get there min before the park opens and maximize the early morning use the mobile order and get a dole whip delicious even the happiest place on earth isn t perfect here are some negatives from our trip for the disney people to look at disneyland was understaffed i know crowds are lower than expected this summer and people s hours got cut but there were entrance turnstiles not staffed at opening creating bottlenecks we did not see one disney photographer on wednesday for most of the day on day finding nemo was staffed by the least disney people ever they ignored the riders and one guy just grunted a number at people to tell them where to stand terrible if you have a fastpass and the ride goes down you get a multiple experience pass which lets you fastpass anything at that tier for us it was space mountain so we could fastpass anything sounds great right it doesn t work at california adventure what the heck they re both disney and we had park hopper privileges so that was really foolish and upsetting loved galaxy s edge but there are some flaws first the falcon should be on the fastpass system second there are not enough character experiences chewie is in a sort of skit about fixing a ship but doesn t interact with you rey is very hard to find she blew by us on day by day i was asking staff where she was for my daughters who wanted a photo no staffer seemed to know suddenly she power walked by us and i managed to ask her for a photo she was great and in character telling us good luck on your mission we got lucky and my daughters who are huge rey fans got a quick photo but rey is not on the app as a character and she is obviously hard to find she s the star of the new movies i didn t see kylo ren and i wonder why capt phasma isn t there she was at launch bay briefly and why you wouldn t have finn and poe the stormtroopers were great but more characters please on day the staff wouldn t even use the galaxy s edge lingo i learned e g bright suns i ll review oga s separately but it was just so so the photo guys in galaxy s edge on day were excellent so that helped color my review along with the lucky meeting with rey overall disneyland was a lot of fun and worth us traveling across the country to experience ,5,2019-08-21
711,🧞‍♂️🧞‍♂️🧞‍♂️,this place is magic it s like that you become a kid again it s a new world the vibes and the shows are amazing you will have to spend the whole day there,5,2019-08-21
712,Avoid,went with my friend and his family extremely expensive waited for hours in line i think we managed to get on four rides the entire day i would never go back ,1,2019-08-20
713,Great but expensive,we visited disneyland with grown up kids we stayed there from rope drop until the final parade and the fireworks it has been an amazing experience i do think however that the prices are extremely expensive i don t see how an average family can afford it nevertheless i recommend buying a maxpass it helped us avoid the long waits and made the experience so much better ,5,2019-08-20
714,Magical,it was a respite from extreme rides but magical and story filled the teens enjoyed themselves but longed for more extreme rides i actually enjoyed the trip more than when i was a teen it s all about characters and stories is what have come to realize it s a really nice park though neat and clean the star wars section was cool ,5,2019-08-20
715,Disney's best park!,disney s best park having been to orlando hong kong and paris i was very surprised at the level of attractions and fun in the original place here in los angeles california by far the most enjoyable park we ve been here for a whole day it s pretty exhausting but the attractions here are better than their counterparts in the brother parks i was in the new star wars compound and still disney itself is the main story here the evening show was spectacular after the electric parade it was wonderful it should be noted that disney prices have risen greatly and i suggest they think a little is this still a place for every child to reach ,5,2019-08-20
716,Great day and night out in a magicial kingdom.,disneyland is expensive we paid and we are not kids yes we went to star wars whilst the ride is useless the experience outside is magical with characters everywhere and displays and even if that not enough the fireworks are alone possibly the best ever if you can september starts the night parade not to be missed treat yourself to one full day of fun no matter your age ,5,2019-08-20
717,It is not actually the happiest place on the earth,i am sorry about the title but unfortunately this is the truth employees are grumpy unfriendly and unhappy there is no help when you ask for directions or informations max pass is wasting of money and time there are few rides only included in this pass and actually you could get the come back time for all of these rides for free from the kiosk next to the attraction the only good thing about this pass that you could get the digital photos that disneyland s photographers will take there is no specific times for the characters appearances my daughter is a great winnie the pooh s fans and we went two consecutive days to disneyland hoping to see winnie but he was already done or not coming very crowded there is no place to sit and for sure there is no sparkling fans around like universal studios or shaded areas i am very disappointed with this visit i had a great expectation for disneyland i had been to disney world and for sure i had better memories disneyland unfortunately is just waiting in lines and walking ,4,2019-08-19
718,Good park experience,this is a well run park people move around very easily it is clean and friendly although on the hottest days the concrete radiates a lot of heat rides are well themed although the fast pass experience is a bit hit and miss a wonderful family experience ,4,2019-08-19
719,Good Disney theme park,not quite as big as the florida park and they could have built more star wars themed rides in that area but other than that a great day out ,5,2019-08-19
720,Worth a Visit,you just can not compare disneyland to disneyworld with that being said disneyworld is the place to go by far i crossed this off my bucket list and probably won t go back again aside from the prices being outrageous from admission to food the cast members were not very pleasant the line for the rides were decent we got on everything we wanted to pretty quickly although we should all put away our phones and enjoy the ride some of us had to travel a long way by train to get to the park and need our phones to be charged in case of an emergency wi fi was next to non exsistant and your battery will die very quickly we brought our chargers but there is absolutely no place to charge your phone luckily we survived lol but in order to charge your phone you have to buy a battery we saw a family charging their phones at an outlet they found only to have cast members that came out of the woodwork freak out on them yell and with a major attitude told them to purchase the battery if they needed their phones charged anyway it s just the point that they will rake you over the coals and charge ridiculous prices for everything as if they couldn t afford to give us all a break they know they will get patrons no matter what but it is quite sad disneyworld in florida is the go to place if you want to enjoy the friendliness of the cast members experience the magic and feel like a kid again ,3,2019-08-18
721,"Excellent park, great staff",with our kids we spent five days in this attraction park we had a blast lots to do and incredibly friendly cast members ok tip take a daily max pass this makes reservation of the attractions a lot easier through your smartphone ,5,2019-08-18
722,Still the best Disney Park!,i have been visiting disneyland since i was little and now i visit with my teenage kids we were excited to visit the brand new galaxy s edge but other than building droids and trying blue milk we found very little to do we stood in line for minutes for smuggler s run but i would never do it again the ride is ok but you spend so much time trying to push your required buttons you miss what s going on on the screen the rest of the park lived up to what we expect from disney and i would definitely recommend the max pass it s worth it just to get all the ride photos and professional photos from around the park for us disneyland is a destination but i don t know how many families can afford the skyrocketing price of park tickets ,5,2019-08-17
723,Magical!,i had been to disneyland several times when i was younger but have not been in about years we loved it we are from the east coast so we normally go to disneyworld the lines here were so manageable you could walk everywhere no buses and you didn t have to plan it out so far in advance i loved using the old fastpass system again my daughters also loved pin trading which they never got into at disneyworld due to the magic bands we don t do simulator rides or roller coasters so there was so much there for us we have never gone on so many rides before we did miss some of the attractions that the magic kingdom has but some here are much better if you have never been most of the ride ques are outside as well as the seating for restaurants we went in the beginning of august so it was hot but not oppressive like florida the mornings and nights are cool so there are really only a few hours in the afternoon where it s hot being in the sun they don t have hall of presidents or carousel of progress to sit and cool down in so you have to plan you have to keep in mind you are waiting in the sun a lot we all decided we prefer disneyland to disneyworld disneyworld has gotten so crowded and crazy that it s taking the fun out of going they are even losing so much of the disney magic in what they do in the hotels etc disneyland still has the magic ,5,2019-08-17
724,The Original Disney,being huge disney fans we decided to combine our las vegas stay with a short trip to the home of walt in la first impressions were immediately a lot smaller than florida but still had the same feel and magic very similar rides as florida and we even managed to get fast passes for the rides we wanted thanks to the new star wars area which drew the crowds away from the other rides first thing in the morning we felt there was no need to stay for more than a day as we had covered all the things we wanted to see if you have not been to florida then you will enjoy this park if like us you have then you may be a little disappointed ,3,2019-08-17
725,Original but not the best,was actually quite disappointed with disneyland having visited walt disney world several times disneyland feels really small ticket prices are also really expensive compared to walt disney world it cost nearly as much for days park entrance to disneyland than it would have cost for weeks park entry to walt disney world i was really looking forward to the new star wars galaxy s edge area and although some of it looks amazing especially the millennium falcon the area could have been done so much better there could should have been much more intractability in this area the smugglers run ride was alright but felt a bit like a slightly more advanced star tours ride i expected sleeping beauty s castle to be bigger it was actually really small one really big positive is because loads of people go straight to galaxy s edge the rest of the park was really quiet we managed to get on of the big rides within the first hour without using any of our fast passes as expected eating or drinking inside the park is very expensive for a bottle of pop or water for a bag of crisps chips so be sure to take food or drink in with you if you want to save some money i would even say that the staff cast members are not as friendly or welcoming as the ones in orlando disneyland has some different rides to walt disney world and even the same rides differ slightly and because of this it is actually worth visiting ,3,2019-08-17
726,Use the Max Pass! It's worth the money!,this trip to disneyland we got a day park hopper ticket we downloaded the disney app on our phones before entering the park and i synced my debit card to my account on the app we had heard things about the max pass so we decided to try it the first day to see if it was worth the money it most definitely was we were able to get fast passes for all the most popular rides radiator springs racers indiana jones hyperspace mountain etc multiple times and we really enjoyed not having to wait more than just a few minutes in line we ended up buying a max pass each day we were there to enjoy its benefits it also allows you to link any photos taken on rides and by professional photographers in the park right to your app what a fun bonus my daughters are and and therefore able to ride all the rides i don t recommend spending the money if you are going with small children as you can t fast pass rides for the younger kids also we spent hour days in the park to really get our money s worth my only small complaint about this visit to disneyland is the employees seem to be getting lazier many of the employees were not friendly or attentive and spent their time socializing with other workers instead of making the customers their number one priority it was disappointing to experience that ,4,2019-08-16
727,Fun 3 Days,this park has something for everyone of every age everyone in the world knows something about disney land and will have something in this park that they enjoy we had days and had different experiences from very full and almost feeling overcrowded to what i would say is mildly busy the app is a must great for telling you line times have a plan if you want to get the most from your day we also did the maxpass and that saved us a lot of time in some of the rides for fantasmic we did a package from the hungry bear and had a great view the best we have ever had without being around too long customer service is second to none here everyone is super friendly and willing to help ,4,2019-08-16
728,Avoid weekends if you can.,want to know why people are not coming when i take my family to orlando i don t mind dropping five grand because the experience is amazing just spent days in anaheim and was seriously disappointed the employees glued to cell phones chatting amongst themselves photographers avoiding customers you can t walk five feet in orlando without your kids being called princess or have a magical day not acknowledged one time by any employee in anaheim in four days one evening at haunted mansion there were cast members at the entrance and not one acknowledged my family as we entered the ride to busy chatting amongst themselves paid photo pass to find low quality photographs rare character photo ops and people that will do their best to avoid you best one was the photo of the other family we got instead of ours never the case in orlando filthy bathrooms and i mean filthy all day long again never the case in orlando why the mall survey people as soon as you get your family through the gate guy was a jerk to top it off overcrowding on the electrical parade day all days had non english speaking teens running rampant to include into my kids had some young female boat operator spouting liberal ideology on the jungle cruise hey disney the problem is the overall operation in anaheim will not spend another dime to take my family to that park ,4,2019-08-15
729,"Save your money for Orlando- Disney, you’ve got a problem",this was a last minute decision to go to disneyland on the last full day of our honeymoon it turned out to be a highlight of our holiday we went to universal studios the day before and disneyland was so much better more organised more value for money make sure to get the max pass which lets you choose your own fast passes for rides and you also get to save all your photos taken by disney photographers to your phone just gutted it was our last full day or we would have gone back for a second day don t miss out ,2,2019-08-15
730,Perfect End to our Honeymoon,between disneyland california and disneyworld florida i would pick disneyworld but of course we still had a great time the new starwars land is where the crowds go first the new falcon millennium ride took an hour to minutes wait annual holders and fastpass are not excepted yet so everyone has to wait as the same my daughter was able to go twice for the falcon ride we got the days park hopper for us that was enough we were able to go and see al what we wanted in both theme parks i highly recommend the fantastic night show in the adventure land you can use your fastpass to reserve a spot for this if it s your first time in disneyland the fireworks is a must to see first come first serve for the best view for this water inside the resort is very expensive but outside the gate you can buy per bottle from the vendors ,5,2019-08-14
731,WOW!!,i always feel like a kid when i visit disneyland i am laughing screaming running around dancing and crying disney keeps me young forever,5,2019-08-12
732,keeps you young forever,this was definitely not a family friendly experience and the only magic is how they are able to extract money from your pocket our experience started in the parking garage where the staff directs you to your parking space we arrived around pm in the afternoon although the parking level had five empty rows the staff forces you to park single file along one row leaving four rows empty we were forced to park at the furthest end of the garage and walk past hundreds of empty parking spaces to get to the tram stop seriously if you alternated cars to each of the rows everyone would be able to park closer to the tram stop and have some time to get out of their car before the next space is filled these empty spaces were not the premium spaces either during the busiest part of the season they charge you peak pricing which means they charge you the highest possible price when the lines are the longest the crowds are the largest and you will be able to ride the fewest attractions disney also does not offer any discounted or half day tickets to offset the long lines disney offers the max pass to speed you through the lines the max pass is a complete and total waste of money and the information provided on the disney website is vague and misleading although the max pass allows you to obtain a fast pass via your smartphone without going to the attraction and you can request another fast pass for the same attraction you can only obtain one fast pass at a time and must wait an hour or more before obtaining another one we visited the park later in the day so most of the fast passes that were available were over hours later and many of the popular attractions did not have any fast passes remaining subsequently we had to wait in lines of minutes or more for the popular attractions even with our max pass towards the end of the night we decided to watch the fireworks from main street however everything was roped off and the park staff kept waving flashlights at us and yelled keep moving however they couldn t explain how to access the roped off areas we eventually ended up along main street shoulder to shoulder with very pushy people and a view of the castle obstructed by a tree if disney wants to improve the magic they need to lower their prices limit the number of guests per day and get rid of the herd mentality when it comes to managing crowds a half day ticket for people arriving after a certain time would be nice as well ,5,2019-08-12
733,"Overpriced, overcrowded and overrated",this was the first trip for the family to california we live closer to florida and go to disney world usually it was easier to do this park in day some of the rides are even longer compared to their florida counterpart it s a small world and pirates of the caribbean for example and i had the max pass option i highly recommend adding this option so we were able to get into the big rides with little to no wait if you plan any disney trip download the app to your phone and link your tickets this way you can see ride wait times your location in the park add fast pass choices and reserve seating for restaurant or order food online to be ready when you get there ,2,2019-08-11
734,Summer Vacay 2019,everyone loves disneyland you have to prepare yourself because the experience is about disneyland and not about the patron get ready to get soft drinks without lids and for spills when moving a loaded tray if you decide to bring your food to the table then fill your beverage be prepared to be chewed out for being told no free refills even if you haven t filled your first drink be prepared to almost get a picture with a character and at the last minute because being turned away there also are a ton of positive experiences like getting an autographed button our last night when a cast member overheard it was our last night the crew is professional arrive at the park early to make the most of the fast pass app use the fast pass app to secure a ride on the matterhorn and hyperspace mountain and indiana jones ,5,2019-08-11
735,Fun fun fun for children,when u pay a bit extra you can use an disney app to get your fast pass which is super convenient i went in begining of july and it was chilly in the morning and evening so should bring a thin jacket you can also online book some restaurants and order food for pickup which is super convenient for those who want to max out your timebin the park it is bigger than tokyo disneyland and lineup were not too long ,5,2019-08-11
736,My happy place,this place lived up to all my expectations loved every moment and have them to treasure lines were not so bad we had the max pass which allows you to download your pictures which is great only disappointment was the fast pass and only able to book a fast pass every minutes ,5,2019-08-10
737,Great 3 day hopper,we did the day hopper ticket and it worked really well the kids loved the rides the shows and the characters the atmosphere was fabulous too it is exhausting to do days in a row but really worth it ,5,2019-08-10
738,Disneyland is So Much Fun,i went with my year old twin daughters and one of their boyfriends ruth and scott have a yearly pass and go at least six times a year they knew everything about the rides and made it that more enjoyable lots of grown ups having fun personally i wouldn t recommend it for children under ,5,2019-08-10
739,Out of this world!,amazing time again at disneyland and blown away by galaxy s edge the attention to detail and interaction between characters and public is ground breaking currently only one ride smugglers run which is an opportunity to pilot the millenium falcon and which blends star wars rebels cartoon characters with star wars movie characters in real time which i understand from my son is called canon great experience only disappointment was oga s cantina which i ll review separately ,5,2019-08-09
740,not good,we visited disneyland on saturday july the th these included my family from abroad a member or our family is a senior and she had back surgery and uses a cane and also local family a group of in total at the entrance they made us throw away a selfie stick but later on i saw that at the park there were several people with tripods the employees that check the bags were very disrespectful and rude t hey treated my wife and i as smugglers according to them for our security t hey were ordering us to open our arms and legs and asked several times if my wife was wearing a belt we understand the procedure at a check up if an alarm goes off but their attitudes and tones of voices were very demanding and again they made us feel mistreated and unwelcomed and we were not even inside the park yet at night after the fireworks my wife and i stayed making a line to board peter pan at the red rose tavern as we came to the line carmela an employee working that night peter pan told my wife to go over the chairs as my wife did she came and told my wife very rudely to go around the chairs and not to go over to what i did go walking around the chairs when the rest of our family came back and joined us to a very short line a patron complained to carmela and she rudely came to me talking very loud and disrespectfully so i had to explain to her that we did not mean to cause problems but also that we see this done all the time and that there is no written statement that we can relate to in order to clarify this incident her supervisor came to talk to me in person she did not raise her voice we had a conversation about this incident after this we were moved to peter pan s ride and they made us wait for another minutes before they told us that the ride was out of service we stood in line just watching carmela and other employees go around but no one approached the line to inform us about peter pan not working we waited over an hour for this ride in between the line for the red rose tavern and the line for the ride itself also we had to endure about minutes stuck inside small world due to mechanical failure overall our experience was not a good one due to your employees mistreatment lack of professionalism rides breaking down and of course the huge crowds we would not recommend anyone to visit disneyland i stopped on my way out of the park at city hall to fill out a complaint form i would like to get a follow up on this matter ,1,2019-08-09
741,Smaller than I expected,after going to disney world disneyland was so much smaller but still fun we got the pineapple dole whip which is amazing the star wars section was well worth it ,3,2019-08-09
742,An expensive but enjoyable day,sure it costs a lot to get into disneyland but in my mind it s well worth going to the happiest place on earth if you have kids they will be thrilled beyond belief as senior citizens we had a ball riding the many rides available plus just walking around is a visual treat make sure you visit the new star wars area it is amazing the toyland ride was by far the most fun it s a high tech shooting gallery ride what a kick make sure you sign up for a fast pass as it will allow you to schedule your times on rides and reduce your time standing in line also i recommend getting into the singles line you may not ride with friends but you get a seat faster it seems disneyland stays fresh and exciting ,5,2019-08-09
743,Best place in the world 🌎,the best place in the world and we had fun there it s always a good place for family and there s alot of choices food ,5,2019-08-09
744,Amazing,it s disneyland therefore it s fabulous it was super hot while we were there and so we needed to go back to the hotel during the hottest times loved using the max pass system was able to ride pretty much everything easily ,5,2019-08-08
745,Spectacular but significantly overpriced.,absolutely spectacular theme parks however after all was said and done we still felt it was significantly overpriced using klook credits helped lower the cost a little bit but overall disney prices do not offer comparable value for food merchandise and drinks also with the introduction of the max pass upgrade we found that the regular fast pass system was almost obsolete every time we attempted to use fast pass the return time was over three hours later or fast pass was not available we believe this is due to max pass users booking all available time slots a bit disappointing for us but overall a spectacular experience as only disney can create ,4,2019-08-08
746,"Wonderful park, so-so service",we go to disney world a ton so we are used to their fabulous service it is much different at disneyland no one there was happy to be working or at least they didn t behave like they were in florida the cast members try to make your experience magical but they don t do that in anaheim the parks though are great really loved star wars galaxy s edge was amazing the incredicoaster is spectacular and we all loved the indiana jones ride don t skip the parks just don t expect great service ,4,2019-08-08
747,Great day,we visited the park on a peak day during the summer so most of the lines were long we had a one day park hopper ticket as we were only in la for a couple of days so we wanted to do both parks it was tough going but we managed it we did disneyland for the morning and california adventure in the afternoon which worked out well then back to disneyland for the fireworks and fantasmic which were both amazing we were there for am which if you want to do galaxy s edge is necessary lines for the new ride were terribly long the sooner it gets a fastpass the better we did single rider and it wasn t as bad but still to minutes first thing pay extra to get the maxpass on your phone definitely worth it to book fastpasses conveniently expensive day but worth it for us,4,2019-08-08
748,Not nearly as crowded as I expected.,we had a full day at disneyland with our two daughters we ended up getting a fast pass after waiting mins for our first ride the fast pass in my opinion is confusing and not worth the hassle it was school holidays still and hot so maybe our experience may have been different out of season it s a big day of walking i m glad i come back too disneyland to take my daughters but i won t be returning the fireworks at night did add a star to the overall score ,5,2019-08-08
749,Full day fast pass and only made 4 rides,unbelievable how the park can keep so many people organized and moving the attention to detail on the new star wars park was amazing and i would go again just for that bring lots of money or your own food as it is incredibly expensive to eat at the park ,3,2019-08-08
750,New Star Wars park,this was my first ever visit to the state of california and disneyland having visited disneyworld fl many times i had my expectations for a wonderful time set i was not disappointed the staff was friendly from arrival to departure we our needs for specialized services they provided everything we needed to make our visit great while our son is probably a little too young to fully process the experience we all had a wonderful time if there were some criticisms i would point out there would be as follows i don t really understand why disneyland like other parks have to set prices so high for things like a bottle of water at approximately per bottle this is nearly x the price you typically pay anywhere else fitness club vending machine etc with the quantity disney receives on a daily basis it is quite sad that they opt to gouge their customers for a simple item like bottled water i understand there are water fountains in places around the park but the quality of water being dispensed is very unknown and something we typically avoid while visiting the visitor services for our special needs i was shocked by two things first was the wait time just to see someone at least minutes and the fact that there isn t a ramp to reach the original entrance one has to enter through a side location which was not as easy to locate i would think that disney would better staff this area and have accommodations immediately in view for visitors who are not able to walk up a series of stairs aside from these two items the experience was wonderful every time we approached a team member we were met with a positive employee who was ready to assist us with approximately employees disneyland is doing an excellent job putting a customer first mindset in place with their employees regardless of stature ,4,2019-08-08
751,First-time Visit To California & Disneyland,i went here for a week with my brother what a great experience disneyland is everything you hear about and more a lifetime of memories little things that stood out a lot in reflection it was all so clean they do such a good job of keeping it clean also the employees and cast members are so good there were a bunch of times we needed help and they were so polite and accommodating and helpful super impressed by that thanks especially to rochelle teresa cheryce bradlee luis jose and animator jodi who showed us how to draw disney characters one of the few places where they treat customers right i would definitely recommend the fastpass option as that was the best way maximize visiting all of the rides the lines weren t as bad as i thought they would be but the fastpass option saves a lot of time and made planning easier favourite rides were indiana jones guardians of galaxy breakout and splash mountain got completely soaked fantasmic at night is also a must see can t miss show just incredible stunts and performances and light and firework spectacle for the new star wars section galaxy s edge the production design and sets were fantastic but there just isn t enough to do there the one ride is fun not worth the wait but has a few cool chances for photos from within he millennium falcon lots of cool photos with the scenery of galaxy s edge but not much else hope they add more to it ,4,2019-08-08
752,Great vacation! So many happy memories,so haven t been in a while lots of fun changes at disneyland pixar pier guardians of the galaxy ride star wars galaxy s edge need i say more some very yummy food don t forget the usual goodies like a corn dog from the cart it s pretty hot in the summer so look at frequent breaks in ac restaurants our fav is golden horseshoe in frontierland ac is on high they hand out free ice water on these hot days of course they also have some yummy floats food we hang out watch the show while waiting for fast passes in california adventure our fav ac place is the starbucks a refresher and a giant scoop sundae from clarabelle s ice cream bring a reusable water bottle that you can refill at the water fountains almost all restrooms have water fountains in front now pixar pier is cute lots of new decor still enjoy the incredicoaster used to be california screamin mulholland madness became goofy s sky school so some of your favorites are still there just new names now star wars has hit disneyland it is awesome we were awestruck everything looked real definitely try the blue green milk fyi they are different flavors lol the storm troopers mingle constantly are hilarious i m anxious to try the ronto wraps at ronto roasters they look smell delicious sound effects make you want to duck specially bottled drinks with foreign space languages written on them it was a hot fun day though ,5,2019-08-08
753,Family Visit,we visited disneyland today and went to millennium falcon smuggler s run as soon as the park was open there was no queue first thing in the morning i was however a little disappointed with the ride as i had expected more certainly the star tours the adventure continues in tomorrowland was much more enjoyable space mountain now called hyperspace mountain was very exhilarating a roller coaster entirely in the dark so you could not anticipate which direction you were going to go next i got completely soaked in the highly scary and enjoyable splash mountain as i was sitting right at the front of the ride equally good rides were the matterhorn and big thunder mountain buzz lightyear astro busters was fun but i only scored indiana jones was a jerky and exhilarating ride all in all a very nice day followed by fantasmic a truly wonderful show and the fantastic fireworks that starts at pm every night ,5,2019-08-08
754,Very good apart from very bad WiFi signal,as the park basically runs on the disneyland app it is frustrating that the wifi signal is poor in so many areas of the park strangely the signal is non existent in many of the restaurants so when you want to get info while having your meal it is not possible you need the app to book restaurants also so it is not possible often when you are standing in line for something else the show times are also on the app rather than on the printed park map otherwise the park was not that crowded for disney in summer with the longest line for millennium falcon smuggler s run please disney improve wifi especially for your overseas guests that don t have american data plans ,4,2019-08-07
755,Vacation,went there july st thru august nd had a great time park not as big as disney world but still just as mush fun this is the place where walt walked and help build ,5,2019-08-07
756,happy time for kids and adults alike provided we lower expectations,great job done in the shows and rides but to reach there you need sheer patience wait for mins is so common i have see many kids crying than happier waiting in the deep sun yes serpentine queue is in the open f sun philosophy of spend more to reduce the wait time maxpass fastpass is boring for disney ticket price may not be enough to make money but for many it is whole year or many years saving and compromise of leaving all other attractions to get a disney feel ,4,2019-08-07
757,Maybe I’m just too old...,okay so i took my girls about years ago and remembered having fun despite the long lines and multitudes of people this trip was just my husband and i it was his first time he s and i m he wanted to build a robot in the star wars area so we wandered over there took a cruise on the tom sawyer riverboat on our way once there we decided to go on whatever star wars ride thing it was signage is kind of poor throughout the park we waited in line probably minutes for this minute virtual ride don t get me wrong it was kind of fun but holy cow what a waste of time we were in the sun half of the wait too ok then we were hungry what kind of random food anyway we went down to critter country or whatever and had a good lunch i think it was reasonably priced for disneyland anyway haha wandered some more went on the finding nemo sub i tried talking him out of the minute wait for this because i remember back when i had my young children we all walked out thinking it was lame yeah same except now i m old and i was getting nauseous from the bubbles and things going by kept my eyes shut for most of that so we went back to star wars so hubby could build the little robot worth well he thinks so so we also wandered over to fantasyland again to get an ornament you can have it hand painted for a nominal fee it turned out beautiful anyway after hours there most of which was spent in line for minute rides i was tired and sore and trying to put on a brave face but boy was i glad when he was ready to go i have absolutely no desire to ever return even with the grandkids i never understood why it s the happiest place on earth i would have rather went to a museum or tour an old mansion anyway just a new opinion from someone who loves disney movies and characters but can do without disneyland ,3,2019-08-07
758,Spring Break Fun at Disney,we do disney evey other year april is the perfect time to co the disney as the weather is perfect so the kids do not get overheated the only issue is that the castle was under remodel the only issue is we were not able to ride peter pan as the wait times are always hours all times of day we tried several different snacks and they were all amazing ,5,2019-08-07
759,Where Magic Lives,how can you not enjoy disney yes the lines can be long and the heat can make even the most passive person get frustrated at even the most minor of issues but at the end of the day disney goes above and beyond to ensure you have a wonderful time i loved all of the food that i ate at the park which was a lot i highly recommend the dole whip and the monte cristo at the blue bayou i observed many cast members disney speak for employees go out of their way to help tourists and their interactions were always impressive i was very glad to get a chance to see the main street electrical parade once again this is one of my favorite parades of all time i will definitely be going back to the park ,5,2019-08-07
760,Star Wars land awesome!,really awesome lots of little extras to check out like ark of the covenant if you know where to look in the building with the stuffed monster heads on the second level water fill station has one eyed alien that grabbed luke in the garbage compactor it pops up when you are refilling water at water station cool how pod racer engine appears to be cooking stange alien creatures meat in ronto roasters on the flip side my sons fave ride pirates of the caribbean broke down before the first waterfall drop and we sat there for minutes overall disneyland was great as usual ,4,2019-08-07
761,Still a great place,i didn t impress any building because all seemed dated maybe i was expected too much fantasy or dream but i might looked at the half of their attractions because i had time only about hours and careful not to miss any of each buildings then i kind of run out time the other side of them maybe others might be nicer not sure i would not go back again anyway tokyo disney land was much prettier nicer cleaner and gave me excitement for sure but it was about years ago ,4,2019-08-07
762,It’s not as fantastic as I thought,in doubt whether to purchase a days ticket to disneyland or one we did start at am make your way to star wars and indiana and do everything else later on we had a fast pass in the app which made it extremely easy always go for that if possible you are already spending a fortune but waiting in line is not the best way of spending that fortune i mist say that the food for kids is above average not just fast food but decent food available would prefer to have it all organic but you need something to wish for right decent and helpful staff that keep it nice and clean accessories are ridiculously expensive that is why people buy it at walmart anaheim so you shouldn t do that rides with small children are good but sometimes the rides are just too dark for no right reason we spent a day with a year old and months old one and day is definitely doable but only with a fast pass ,2,2019-08-06
763,Fun day at the park!,we visited disneyland for the st time last week it was so much fun and way less crowded than disneyworld i love that all of the older nostalgic rides from when i was a kid are still there like snow white s scary adventures mr toad s wild ride and pinocchio the price tag for one day is steep we paid almost for one day that was the only drawback i would definitely go back the staff are incredible my daughter lost her knapsack and the staff member who it was turned in to immediately sent it to security because she had and her phone inside elaine at lost and found security was so wonderful to my daughter she calmed her down called around to locate the bag and really went out of her way to help us ,5,2019-08-06
764,"""Certainly far from the Happiest Place on Earth.",i went with my family to disneyland monday july nd we got there for the am opening several of the park staff recommended and advised to us to go to star wars galaxy edge around pm instead of immediately upon entering the park when there was a min wait to get on the millennium falcon ride possibly from early entry through the hotels one no longer has to make a reservation to get into the land but the lines are horrendous for attractions and no fast passes we felt that the park was totally oversold and the experience was miserable even though we paid extra for fast passes even in fantasy land the simplest of rides was a minuite wait anything thing worthwhile was a longer wait even with fast passes at pm the wait in galaxy s edge was now over hrs for anything we spent the day walking in circles not getting on hardly any rides our phones ran out of battery just trying to use fast passes to get on rides take back up battery pack huge waste of money walt would be rolling in his grave if he knew his park was being run like this all for profit and not for the enjoyment of families and children shame on you disney corp i had been to disneyland several times in the past never was it as bad as this last visit sadly ,1,2019-08-06
765,"3 days, one park per day",i got my discount tickets at undercovertourist com we did two days at disneyland and one day at california adventure we were in disneyland from am to midnight each of the two days and our kids couldn t get enough the single park per day was a better deal for us we use fast passes as smart as we can next time i would consider two day with one park per day and pay for the maxpass so the fast pass system can work even smoother the new milennium falcon ride was so cool ,5,2019-08-06
766,It's not DisneyWorld,a miniature version of disney world it was ok not what i had hoped for but if you have been to disney world then to disneyland you know why it s just not the same now it was fun but i d recommend folks who are planning of coming to disneyland go here first before you go to disney world ,3,2019-08-06
767,Incredible place to visit,came here for the th celebration on my mother s th birthday this trip was more for her as she was a life long disney fan but i would be lying if i didn t enjoy myself as well definitely need a minimum or days to truly enjoy the park but really days is recommended ,5,2019-08-06
768,"Crowded, but Fun",disneyland will always be a kid favorite my recent trip there was no exception the new star wars land appears to be just in its infancy there is lots of empty space there for future growth the new ride there was interesting and full of modern technology it s too early to judge the land the prices for everything remain high and the crowds are thick my only complaint was in the evenings when disney does the special events such as the parade fireworks and fantasmic disney does an awful job of communicating about these events the park shuts down rides and walkways and wedges thousands of visitors into small highly congested areas it s really uncomfortable if we had known the ride we wanted was shut down during the parade we could have planned better or decided to leave before it was impossible to do so during the parade it is essentially impossible to freely exit the park there is just too much going on at once during these three special evening events disney should pick one and stick with it for everyone s safety ,4,2019-08-05
769,family,it was our st time and we got there a little late in the morning the park gets busy around lunch time we loved it though our year old daughter had a blast ,5,2019-08-05
770,Really great Disneyland visit!,we are from hong kong and in comparison with the hk disneyland the disneyland here in ca was really good all the rides were really great and we thoroughly enjoyed it download the disneyland app to monitor wait times and go to rides when wait times are short make sure to visit galaxy s edge first thing in the morning or wait till late at night for shorter lines ,5,2019-08-05
771,Extra Magic Hours Not So Magic,having been to wdw in orlando we were accustomed to most of the parks being opened for early magic hours we chose to stay at the disneyland paradise pier partly for this reason as well as the proximity we were super disappointed to discover only tomorrowland and fantasy land were open for the extra magic hours we had hoped to take advantage of this time to ride rides in adventure and frontier lands before heading up to star wars galaxy edge in addition rides would randomly shut down throughout the day including indian jones jungle cruise matterhorn and big thunder mountain railroad i honestly think disney does not have enough staff to operate the entire park for extra magic hours and regular operating hours hence the closures still disney does a great job with theming and the star wars area is amazing note we were in the line at for millennium falcon smugglers run and it was over hours long when we returned at pm we did the singles line and waited minutes ,4,2019-08-04
772,Star Wars attraction is open!,disneyland itself is so magical but with the addition of star wars it was beyond my dreams i was so in love with how interactive everyone is and how well designed the place is i honestly cannot put proper words to describe how amazing it was ,5,2019-08-04
773,disney,i have been to disney world in florida before so this time i went to disneyland it is disney so you know that it will be super expensive and it was i bought the one day one park pass most people go more than one day but i can t afford that when you come in at the gate they take your picture on your ticket so that you can return later this worked out well for me i went early to galaxy edge and it was super cool the ride does go back and forth so i would not recommed it to someone that has medical problems bad back the details involved were perfect after enjoying most of the rides i left went back to the hotel and relaxed in the pool i went back to disneyland refreshed and ready for the fireworks i had brought an empty water bottle and that worked out well as there are lots of drinking fountians you can go to any resturant and ask to ice water and they will give you a big cup full for free ,5,2019-08-04
774,Great Disney experience,first time to disneyland and great experience been to disney world many times and this was different but just as good galaxy edge was incredible and the best experience definitely worth the cost but go prepared to spend money to make it worth the experience ,5,2019-08-04
775,WE DID IT..........WILL NEVER FORGET IT,the cost is outrageous but there is no place on earth like it just seeing princesses walking around and my daughters intstant reaction and awestruck looks were priceless most of the rides were pretty cool but some of the themes were a bit scary for younger kiddos guess we forget that fairy tales aren t without the opposing forces star wars sections needs to step it up just a glorified shopping area ,4,2019-08-03
776,Great for all ages!,for my last spring break of college and my brother s last one of high school our aunt brought us on a trip to disneyland disney s california adventure we all had a blast disney is always a magical place once you enter the park they are always clean kind and have exceptional service traveling with a severe food allergy can be difficult but the park staff made it incredibly easy the world of color show was even more magical as usual there is hardly any place you can go that tops the fun magical experience of a disney park tips use fastpasses to maximize your time ,5,2019-08-03
777,Earthquake in Disney,we had a great time at the park on a busy th of july park was packed to top it all we experienced one of the larger after shocks of the earthquake on th july in la the park is what you expect from disney theme parks excellent rides parades great firework display to end the day the new star wars section is impressive we did not get to ride the new starwars ride due to and half hrs waiting time bit disappointed at the new the maxpass system works have to pay per person before you can be able to load fast passes via the disney app for a family of the last time we were disneyworld years ago this was a free service as long as you have the app you could load your fastpass selections disneyland is much smaller than disneyworld only theme parks so if you have visited disneyworld before it maybe a bit disappointing but overall still a world worldclass disney disney expereince ,4,2019-08-03
778,This is not the Cantina you`re looking for.....,we went into galaxys edge excellent depiction of what i always thought that the real life mos eisley spaceport would be and yes i m years old all lovingly recreated with excellent attention to detail be sure to avoid the merchandise though as you would need a helping hand from han solo to afford them however the cantina experience was another matter it cost a small fortune to book a dinner slot booked for pm actual time of entry was pm we got to choose drinks per person in a party of the amount for one round of drinks was a cool we politely declined a second drink dinner was not free another for a plate of snacks i would hesitate to give to my cat also felt that children should have not been allowed in what to all purposes was a working bar selling and promoting alcohol galaxys edge yes orgas cantina no no no,4,2019-08-03
779,Disneyland trip,the trip was excellent despite disneyland raise their price on the admission park we were able to get a discounted price admission for days with max pass from tripadvisor the max pass was a tremendous help for us it save us a lot of time and really makes our trip to disneyland much happier and enjoyable event ,4,2019-08-02
780,Magical,even as someone who is about to turn disneyland is a magical place seeing the joy in your kids is well worth the trip and the cost like any park have a plan of action in place so you don t waste time i also highly recommend downloading the disney park ap so you can keep track of wait times if done right you can hit almost all the major rides in one day ,5,2019-08-02
781,Park keeps getting better and better!,loved seeing sleeping beauty s castle and getting to do the walk through going on classic rides like haunted mansion splash mountain big thunder railroad as well as exploring the new galaxy s edge great during the day and night hyperspace mountain too ,5,2019-08-02
782,Disneyland,this was my first ever trip to disneyland after almost trips to disney world in orlando honestly i was quite disappointed the castle was under renovation which happens i understand unfortunately nowhere on their website did it state that it would be covered in a tarp when we went to guest services all they did was argue with us and say it s our fault for not reading the fine print this only made us more upset because we read everything there was to read we ran into multiple issues over the course of our trip such as fastpasses not working dining reservations being hours late and so much more disneyland was still a magical experience but disney s guest services definitely made me positive i don t need to go back for a very long time ,3,2019-08-02
783,Great Day,best experienced with small children many of the attractions are showing their age the new star wars area really only had one worthwhile attraction running millenium falcon which had a very long queue it was good but not that good staff during the fireworks were officious and silly about herding people into designated areas the tiki room was mildly offensive for visitors from a south pacific island nation might be a good idea to shut it the food offerings were uniformly bad largely fried ,4,2019-08-02
784,A Grand Old Lady Showing Her Age,love disney this park is great the staff are amazing and that jack sparrow what a character the new starwars land is incredible like you are stepping into a movie but its an insane wait to ride the millenium falcon worth it but insane eat a turkey leg have a dole whip and enjoy every moment also if you don t want to get wet do not go on splash mountain and if you don t want to take a full swim in a pool or full body shower sans soap don t sit in the front seat the best trip ever ,3,2019-08-01
785,Happiest place on Earth for a reason!,having been to the florida disney i found this one the original not as good lots was the same it had a few extra things such as the matterhorn bobsleigh ride but i just felt there weren t as many rides there wasn t as much space and i don t know i was ready to leave early in the day having said that disney does what it does very well and if you re in la and haven t ever done disney do go because it is all pretty magical ,5,2019-08-01
786,It's Disney...,oh my goodness this has been on my bucket list since i was a little kid and when i was invited on a trip i was so excited but so scared of disappointment but wow the kid at heart in me came out full force during this trip and i wish i could ve stayed longer ,4,2019-08-01
787,Child at Heart,we always enjoy coming here just about every time i ask kids where they would like to spend their summer vacation we end up in california love the attraction and teams are always available and willing to help what is amazing for me is as big as the park i have never seen debris on floor and facility always clean and in working condition,5,2019-07-30
788,Vacation,it is especially fun for the kids but not as great as the magic kingdom of orlando cost for a ticket for a one year old he was excited but likely one should wait until kids are three or older last year we went on s family outing with a five year old to disneyworld orlando that is a great age for young children to appreciate the awesome family playground ,5,2019-07-30
789,Not as great as Disneyworld,although this is the first disney theme park and doesn t compare in size to disney world it is still a great place to go enjoy and have fun for all ages there are some rides that is different than disney world but there are a few rides and shows here that i like better here a few friends told me i all i need is two days for disneyland and california adventure but i chose to do days because i haven t been here in well over plus and don t what to expect i am glad i spent this many days as both parks were crowded and there was no rush to get everything done in one day for each park i see this park still uses a park ticket card for entry into the park whereas disney world use a magic band full disclosure disney resort guest get the magic band for free the mb serves as your park ticket room key photopass and an option to pay which bills to your credit card on file where you are staying at a disney hotel in addition i have to insert my card into a fast pass machine however i use the disney app to scan at the fp entry instead of giving the cast member the paper fp which only serve to tell you when the return time is one would think disneyland park would be technologically streamlined like in disney world for those going to the galaxy edge to ride the smugglers run go when the park opens or do the single rider i did both ways and it is not as painful to wait on line late in the day i had to use a combination of the park map and the disney app to navigate around as the park map is not as accurate nor was the app always up to date with my movements ,5,2019-07-30
790,Still fun for all ages,this place is for all ages love the atmosphere the rides and the food who can go to anaheim and not go to disney ,4,2019-07-30
791,Great place for kids and adults,kids had a blast when we went there the lines weren t that long and we had fastpass so we were able to ride all the rides the kids were allowed to ride it was very memorable ,5,2019-07-30
792,It is not the happiest place on Earth,if you don t have the disney app and aren t savvy with getting the fast passes you re out of luck even at the end of may when school was still in session it was way overcrowded so expensive and there are really no accommodations for those who can t stand in line other than getting a fast pass and coming back at a certain time or getting a scooter or wheelchair and sit in line to pay for a three day park hopper for four people and have to wait in a hour line for a ride is ridiculous i won t be going back for a long time my kids had fun but my husband and i did not it was exhausting and we didn t get to see everything because of the lines crowds ,3,2019-07-29
793,Fastpass priority is not fair,we looked forward to this trip for our year old grandson for years and months after it was planned we chose not to do fastpass because of the extra money and the scheduling restrictions it was extremely frustrating to see people per ride get cuts ahead of us while we waited and sweated in degree heat this process sets an example to children that people with more money get priority in this world i like the old way where every person waited the same amount of time and all guests were equal now each ride requires cast members to corale the standby guests so that fastpass guests get priority it is not fair cast members stay far away from standby guests and treated us like scum just in case we got upset with all the people cutting ahead of us to get a much shorted wait this fastpass concept needs to be eliminated don t they have enough ways to take our money for a hot dog for a mouse ear headband the rides were fun but the lines and the prices were outrageouse and ridiculous enough is enough never again ,2,2019-07-29
794,Crowded and hot but fun,it took us forever to actually get into the park because of a bottleneck at the ticket booth we waited in line a good minutes it would be great if disney had self service kiosks because a lot of people despite standing in line for minutes didn t seem to know what ticket they wanted once they reached the counter long conversations ensued that aside we had a good time once we accepted long waits for rides and the heat we had a little trouble finding some of the fast pass stations but disney staff were always helpful our favorite was splash mountain where we got absolutely soaked it cooled us off and i was thrilled to see the cinema since disney world has gotten rid of that to pack in yet another souvenir shop ,5,2019-07-29
795,Helpful Disneyland points,purchasing tickets makes no difference if you buy online or queue as it s the same queue for entering into the first part would recommend the max pass fast track especially if you are with kids with the fast track you can download the app scan your entrance tickets once you have done this go to my plans and book your first fast track advice use your fast track to book the most popular ride that is showing the longest wait time because if you leave this for later you will get a late time to do this basically if this is showing a long wait time in the morning already then that ride will get busier in the day which means longer queues waiting time once you book your first fast track you will have to wait an hour and half for the next fast track to book make sure to enter alarm in your phone to remind you as you can get excited yourself and distracted by kids to remember to book the next one lol we went early and left park around and took a break from it and returned around pm with our fast tracks booked prior be sure to watch the parade fireworks and shows in the evening food is expensive inside definately take snacks and a cooler bag for water and drinks there are fountains inside but i couldn t seem to locate them especially when it s crowded we did the main park first day and second day adventure park do the grizzly river run ride first in the morning as you will get wet for that ride and at least you have the day to dry off there was hardly a queue for that ride so we ended up doing the ride three times this is a fast track ride but don t use your fast track pass on this so it really helps that you can use your fast track for another use the next fast track for guardians of the galaxy the best ride there ,5,2019-07-29
796,The Best,can t believe it took me to the age of to head to disney with the family everyone had a great time the place is truly magical ,5,2019-07-28
797,Good times,visited this past week the star wars area was impressive the heat while we were there was oppressive bought the fast pass definitely worth the money when there are a lot of people however there were a number of rides that were out of service at the middle of the day by the time they came back in service the fast pass access was over hours later making the fast pass worthless ,4,2019-07-28
798,Dark Ride Heaven,i love this park because of the classic dark rides pirates of caribbean haunted mansion snow white alice in wonderland mr toad and many more ,5,2019-07-28
799,Family fun,we loved disneyland we go there every other year with my entire family all wearing the same shirts making memories great place ,5,2019-07-28
800,Just the right size,is it bigger than disneyworld no way is it fun yes will your feet hurt after several hours yep is it worth it yes star wars galaxy edge was enjoyable wait times between to min get there first to get it out of the way being the two pilots up front is the best the turkey legs are bigger than your head and so delicious two people can share one approx for two the lines were long to get in as security has to check all bags the night shows are really nice ,4,2019-07-28
801,It's the original,yes it s smaller than disney world and the castle is so tiny you walk through it in under ten steps but really it s big enough to enjoy yourself for more than a day many of the rides might share the same name and idea with wdw rides but they also have a lot of differences to make them unique let s be honest though if you are reading this you are also going to go and probably won t even read this ,5,2019-07-28
802,New Star Wars Sensational,loved the new star wars park they out did themselves disney s best ever every shop live characters everywhere every set and the ride were just amazing must do must see and don t miss any part of it ,5,2019-07-28
803,Great place for your children to see/meet Disney Characters,the children have a lot of fun meeting mickey and such getting their autographs and having pictures taken as well lines and ride breakdowns make for frustration on part of adults and children alike star wars area was more about the look and shopping than ride type attractions the ride is cool but the even with fast pass the wait is a pain and the person grouping thing makes it a bit weird sometimes ,3,2019-07-28
804,Not a good value,the fastpass system worked well and we got to maximize our time there going on at least a dozen attractions throughout the day however most of the park is still the same old tires rides from the s and the cost of admission is just too much for the entertainment the park provides and was not a good value ,1,2019-07-27
805,lines long,the best park is the show of fantastic at the end of the night if you have very small kids and pay the supplement for a meal nearby the seating is good we paid a huge price for days and we allowed to go for one magic morning even though we had to get up very early it was worth it did more rides in hours than the entire day before ,4,2019-07-27
806,Get the max fast pass,we visited on a monday as a family of including a teenager it was a great day and there s something for everyone despite being in the park before am and going straight to the new star wars area the queue for smugglers run was still minutes i d do it later in the day next time as it tends to go down to minutes by late afternoon i would definitely get the max fast pass again it s per person per day but literally saved us hours of queue time and walking long distances to the paper fast pass distribution machines ,5,2019-07-27
807,"Fabulous Happy Place, Expensive Eating",had a fantastic time lot of rides yiu need more than a day to cover all the important rides eating at any place is very expensive but you have no option you can go out come back with a stamp but then you will miss lot of rides going coming overall you have good service few lines for important rides mins a very happy place wanting you to return again ,5,2019-07-27
808,"Better than I expected, still magical",this was my family s first disneyland trip we have been to disney world several times and even disneyland paris we love disney world disneyland paris wasn t as big and it just seemed like a twilight zone version of disney world to me because things were the same yet different and not as much stuff still fun but feeling unsettling lol i thought disneyland in california would be the same as the other disneyland no it s not the same as disney world but it s real close and still magical enough for me i loved some of the rides they had that disney world doesn t have or they do but they are different we did the pin trading thing which was fun and as far as souvenirs go that fits on a plane a lot easier lol the castle was so much smaller that expected so that was about the only disappointing thing i found their app has a system which allows you to order food ahead and if you use the max pass extra per person you can line up your fast passes on the app ordering the food was so much easier this way as it helped avoid long lines we also went ahead and ordered the picture package for like and all the pictures they took or was taken on rides came across to our app almost immediately the star wars stuff recently opened but the crowds but have been scared away disneyland park was less crowded than the disney california adventure park the wait for the smugglers run millennium falcon was still always ranging minutes all day so we took the morning while everyone was in line for that to knock out the other rides which now had shorter lines lol if you are like me and thought disney world is the only way to go and disneyland can t compare i say it s worth a shot i had a great time we wrapped it into a california vacation where we went to other cities so our trip wasn t all disney i can say i don t think there is enough there to stay a full on week like you can at disney world we stayed days and did everything we wanted to fyi napolini pizza in downtown disney is great we have been to italy and that s about as close and you will get to real italian pizza and for the of us in the dine in restaurant we could get out with the huge family pizza and drinks for about not including tip they have a take out right next to them with personal sizes to go too ,5,2019-07-26
809,"A bit overpriced, but so much fun",only paid for one park and hit almost all the rides in one day using the max pass the new star wars land is well done and the ride is fun ,5,2019-07-26
810,"Mickey & Minnie have moved out. Death Vader & The Avengers moved in, and the magic has died.",the disney magic in walt s vision has been replaced by the force i have been coming here for years and i will never come back it was the happiest place on earth until now the cast members talk about their personal lives as you are waiting there to be helped not ok the merchandising is not the high grade that it once was everything is sparkle and glitter very few actual collector s art available it has disappeared weather can be bad crowds can be obnoxious this can t be helped disney has let go of a quality experience and is in it for the money only no more charm magic or happiness here and we really tried to find it we visited our favorite spots and attractions but no matter how hard we tried it wasn t seen or felt the spirit of disneyland is gone every once in a while you will find an a cast member and you re surprised you used to be wowed by every one you met who worked here and now they are few and far between we understand good is good can be expensive here but the portions and plates have gotten smaller and the prices continue to increase people say you don t know what walt disney would do but i would like to think that he would never have star wars marvel and put them in his parks he would have stuck with the dream that made disneyland what it once was those days are gone we will never come back we don t want to spend our money on this travesty ,1,2019-07-26
811,Yeah Disneyland !,haven t been for years pretty much the same lots of people but that is to be expected we deal with it starwars land was nice we did the single rider for the smugglers run that way we got on within minutes or so ,5,2019-07-26
812,It's ok because it's Disney,when i went here it just reminded me of a miniature version of disney world if i were you i would just go to the one in orlando instead make sure you bring a lot of with you but you already know that it can get pretty hot and crowded in the summer time i younger sister enjoyed it a lot more though and that s all it matters to me ,3,2019-07-26
813,Great for young families,disneyland is quite obviously aimed solely at young children hence our group of adult friends found the rides more than a bit underwhelming the only ride any of us actually liked was space mountain the atmosphere was still fun to experience and the fireworks were great ,3,2019-07-26
814,"For young kids, absolutely - look elsewhere for very real thrills",we were about years too late taking our kid to disneyland found all the rides way too underwhelming and our year old was really disappointed atmosphere is cool and wonderful to see young kids being swept up by the whole experience but having ticked it off the bucket list we won t ever be back ,3,2019-07-25
815,Best Trip Ever!,the crowds were low due to seasonal passes being blacked out due to star wars land we never waited longer than minutes to go on any ride star tours was fantastic this was the best trip ever ,5,2019-07-25
816,The original and still the best!,disneyland was the first park of its kind and it s still the best the addition of the new star wars themed galaxy s edge is fantastic a truly immersive experience for any star wars fan and very enjoyable even if you re not the new millennium falcon ride has got to be the best simulator ride i ve experienced but it does help if you have some good pilots be warned however that the park can get a bit crowded i also recommend not taking children who can t walk for themselves it seems the park has become inundated with strollers and my personal opinion is that if the kids are too young to walk they re too young to remember the experience and given the cost i think it s best to wait until they re old enough to appreciate it ,5,2019-07-25
817,Definitely different than Disneyworld,went for new galaxy s edge one of the rides won t be available until jan so maybe i would have waited did the make your own light saber thing which is totally cool if you are worried about getting it back on plane you can mail the tube to yourself thru usps for tsa is now used to lightsaber hafts a lot of the other rides have been re themed star wars which wasn t really necessary like space mountain which was better before download the app and make reservations the day of but careful they will charge you for the cantina and lightsaber workshop whether you show up or not the cantina did not have star wars iv monsters it s just a bar fireworks go off over the spires of baatu city ,5,2019-07-25
818,"Went for new Galaxy's Edge. Doesn't redefine theme parks, but a lot of fun.",disneyland is always a good time we got to go in the park early with our tickets which allowed us to access rides before it got busy it was hot so we utilized the fast passes ,5,2019-07-24
819,good time,my son and i went during the week of vidcon the weather was a bit too much for me as i didn t get enough water on hot days it is per bottle so beware bathrooms seemed to be far and few between we enjoyed the rides incredicoaster was our favorite by far bought the maxpass which i enjoyed but didn t get as many pictures as i had hoped for the price did not do much with fastpass ,4,2019-07-23
820,"An expensive day of entertainment, but worth it!",having been to disneyland many many times over the years i continue to be amazed at the efforts this park makes to stay relevant disney is not and has never been just about the rides instead customer service and attention to detail is what sets this park apart from the moment you enter its gates every disney employee you meet is out to ensure that you are having the best day of your life you are greeted welcomed and thanked constantly yes you will spend a lot of money at disneyland but because of the way you are treated you don t mind doing so with star wars land having just opened we were expecting huge crowds but this wasn t the case ride lengths varied but with the fast pass system you can strategize your time spent waiting hint outside food and drinks are allowed bringing your own snacks can save you a lot of money hint free water refills throughout the park bring your own container so you aren t spending for new water bottles hint show seating starts minutes before showtime bring word puzzles etc to pass the time hint electrical outlets are hard to find an extra battery is helpful don t have your own these can be rented throughout the park for a modest fee one fee covers you for a day so if you rent a battery and it runs out you can trade it in for a new one at no cost hint if you need an electrical scooter and will be going to the park for more than one day rent a scooter off site we rented an ecv for days for from a local company that delivered and picked up right from our hotel hint shopping the disney outlet before your visit can save you hundreds on souvenirs many of the shirts and stuffed animals are sent to the outlet from the parks anyway and sold at a fraction of the price hint disney is big on glow in the dark light up toys dollar stores are a great place to buy glow sticks bracelets etc for kids to wear around the park at night ,4,2019-07-23
821,The Happiest Place on Earth,my sixth trip to the ca park first one in love it fun to ride the classic rides peter pan snow white it s a small world and try the new ones star wars and indiana jones for some reason the ca park seems more chill and manageable than the fl park had another great visit ,5,2019-07-23
822,lovely,get ready to become a kid lovely rides lots of stuff to watch make sure that during the parade you come and hour earlier and book a sitting space thats a experience of a life time very well organised and be ready to sing songs with the disney characters,5,2019-07-23
823,Whoo hoo!,everyone heads to star wars right away to we did rides from til with no lines but star wars was awesome the staff at the park was great no complaints ,5,2019-07-22
824,Churros rule,the happiest place on earth doesn t disappoint star wars galaxy s edge was a bit of a disappointment the rest of park is awesome the guardians of galaxy tower of terror is awesome overall a great place orlando is better however and less expensive ,5,2019-07-22
825,Absolutely splendid,seriously if i need to sell this to you then maybe don t go happiness may not be your thang so much to do make the most of maxpass on at least one ticket use fastpass for those rides you don t want to stand in massive queues for we had a magical time definitely worth it ,5,2019-07-22
826,"My Disneyland review, after 5 trips to Disneyland from Canada.",thanks for reading i have been to disneyland in anaheim times from without kids to july with teenagers we love it there and have been to disneyworld in florida twice as well here are some general thoughts and suggestions overall hope it s helpful if it is give me a helpful vote please the parks are of course crowded there is never any getting around that however you can see everything you want in both disneyland and california adventure and not wait in a line more than minutes and i will tell you how first get a day park hopper max fast pass ticket this gives you total freedom to come and go to both parks as much as you want over days the max fast pass ticket gives you free photos when you go on rides that take them or the random disney photographers take them of you it also gives you and this is the important part the ability to book your fast pass tickets for all the rides that have them on your phone from inside either park if you don t have this you have to physically go to the ride that carries the fast pass and get a ticket this creates several issues like walking way more not knowing when you need to be back until you get there not having the ability to organize and be strategic i would never go there without the max fast pass again next be very strategic enter early at least one morning stay late to the end at least one night this will allow you to take in your favourite busiest rides when it s slower but also in the dark if you like that and you ll experience the night life which is fun use the mobile food ordering part of the app it s amazing decide what you want in the shade as a family type it in press order it s charged to your credit card and it will be ready in minutes no lines and no waiting and we didn t have one mistake pack lots of water to the park with you in one back i took at least bottles of water for each of us you don t want to spend per bottle and there isn t many fountains and the water isn t good don t take more than you need into the park we took one back pack they re a pain they re heavy you have to take them off for every ride the less you take in the better don t waste your time in lines use the max fast pass app be organized do things at slower times like early morning later night when things are happening like fantastic show fireworks parades splurge you re on holidays have fun and eat the ice cream try a churro enjoy your time we took our kids when they were quite young and we took them to disneyworld after that and this time they were looking back i wouldn t take a child until they re they ll still want to do everything they can walk on there own they should be able to do pretty much everything at that age and you won t be pushing a stroller where to stay short answer in my opinion stay a ways away and uber we were a min drive which is really not that far and it was each way roughly the longest we waited was minutes we did a beautiful air bnb and we had a full kitchen laundry living room bathrooms our own parking it was bliss it s usd to park at disney so this was cheaper than parking our rental car if you park you re looking at min to get the tram and get to the main gates however when you leave at the end of then night it could take you an hour uber all the way trust me if you want to spend massive dollars then sure stay in a disney resort you have the choice of i believe and they re all amazing but too rich for me with less amenities there s a lot more to the disney experience than rides take it all in in my opinion the day pass is the way to go and i ve been there times and done it every time now our kids are more or less grown so that could be it for us as we have a few other continents to do have a happy day ,5,2019-07-21
827,Prevalent and frequent breakdowns - a huge ripoff,we have been here many times but this is the most disappointing in spite of the really nice star wars land in our single day we had the following breakdowns splash mountain matterhorn bobsleds toy story radiator springs basically half of the rides we want to be on some of these broke down midway thru hour long waits this never happen at other disney parks it really kills the experience and wastes valuable time of guests of course disney management wants folks to come multiple days but not all guests can do that or want to at the end of the day this is lazy and under investment in maintenance disney needs to shape up it s management should be ashamed of its incompetence it is not ok to do this ,2,2019-07-21
828,"Crowded, expensive, but still a magical place for all ages",crowded for sure pricey for sure but still an wonderful place that is the pinnacle of theme parks ,5,2019-07-21
829,Average - not worth it,we myself and my sons arrived at lax at am in the morning so we thought we d go to disneyland park to kill some time cos hotel checkin wasn t until pm and disney was closer to lax than our hollywood hotel turned into an expensive day to say the least we had to leave our luggage with a storage company near the airport good thing was they came and collected it but it cost and the guy told us he d bring it to our motel when we got there and just give him a call but he didn t so we had to pay to travel back to lax to pick our luggage up after paying in a super shuttle to get to disneyland and to get from disneyland to our motel on top of that we paid each just to get into disneyland park and although there s some cool things to see and the castle we always see on tv was impressive i m sorry but i personally think unless you have kids or you re a kid at heart this wasn t worth the money and everything was expensive and over priced so bring the loaded credit card lol i wish i d skipped going to disneyland now and i would have saved myself hundreds of dollars universal studios warner bros studios was way much more fun and a quarter of the price of my disneyland experience ,3,2019-07-21
830,Iconic Adventures,the main park is expensive but worth every penny long lines midday so plan your entrance to the opening hour for access to the most popular rides i e bob sleds space mountain splash mountain and attractions definitely attend at night if you are able for a completely different park spend your time in the main street shops at the end of the day after you are tired from all of the main attractions ask one of the cast members for their favorite attraction and any secrets to the lesser known attractions they all have their opinions ,5,2019-07-20
831,2 Day Park Hopper,i have a young family stayed near the park went on tuesday wednesday moderately short lines for mid july used the fast pass throughout the day brought in waters and lunch in backpacks ate dinner in the park great trip cast members were very helpful ,5,2019-07-20
832,Happiest Place on Earth????,this is a good review on how to spend your time at disney trust me i m calling my review the happiest place on earth hi there i can t believe i m not finding any other reviews regarding how some of the rides have changed over the years let s talk about the pirates of the caribbean indiana jones or the haunted house they have changed these rides over the years the pirates of the caribbean used to have a starry sky years and years ago we came in and it was gone i thought it would be back upon my next visit still the same very disappointed disney what did you do also they tamed down the indiana jones ride the rock no longer comes right at you it s not the thrilling ride it used to be standing in line for an hour to get on indiana jones is a waste of time don t do it there are better rides go on the bob sleds space mountain splash mountain i won t go into the haunted house it s just more of the same disappointing it s a small world has been revamped and they did good with that one food the food here sucks the french market in new orleans is probably the best your going to do they have fresh salad don t eat any of their fast food you will be sorry read the other reviews security hear sucks i had my personal alarm taken it makes a loud noise if i feel threatened well they wouldn t let me have it and made me surrender it and they don t hold anything they take from you you cannot bring rolling backpacks in the park either they made us pay for a locker to put ours in just a heads up but our worst experience here imagine taking kids here who live in mexico these kids live under poverty level but they are still american citizens i won t go into that these kids went around selling homemade brownies to help pay for this trip as i couldn t pay for all of it they wanted to see mickey and minnie mouse all the way from arizona to california in the car what did i hear we want to see mickey minnie well when they finally saw minnie they went running up to her after all those miles of driving and hard work of selling brownies the park attendant wouldn t even let the year old hug her the happiest place on earth look at our photo and judge for yourself ,2,2019-07-19
833,I loved it !!,disneyland was incredible it was very easy to navigate lines were long but we got fast pass and got to get in more rides for days when we purchased the fast pass i highly recommend you to get it my daughter is and petite i was so glad that she was able to get in all rides of course we got in with her as well due to her height which was no issue everyone had an amazing time food was good as well even though we only tried spots churros amazing as well i can t wait to go back ,5,2019-07-19
834,Pirates of the Caribbean is still my favorite!,love the fact that disneyland allows guests to bring in food and water this is a great idea for parents on a budget ,5,2019-07-19
835,My Happy Place,my first visit to disneyland was in i go back about every four years since it is still the most enjoyable place to visit i have taken my daughter and my grandkids although at times it gets very crowded it is still just as magical i still enjoy all the rides i highly recommend a visit ,5,2019-07-19
836,Not the happiest park,we ve been visiting walt disney world for years and we love it there so when we decided to visit the original disneyland we couldn t wait especially when galaxy edge opened i mean it s the original where it all started from when we got to the park we definitely noticed a difference the cast members seemed to be very grumpy no pun intended no smiles eye contact or warm greetings it s like a regular amusement park we brushed it aside and continued our way to the rides thinking that it could be an off day we purchased the maxpass which we thought it would be like the fastpass in wdw nope it allows you to make one fastpass after you finish your fastpass then you can choose another if one available in wdw you can choose three fastpasses at once we finished our first fastpass and the ones available wasn t worth getting since the line wait for it was only minutes the next day it was the same temperament from the cast members that when we realize the big difference from disneyland to disney world we didn t even know that the photographer were there in the parks take pictures they were hiding in the background and it was hard to see i happened to notice one and flagged him to take pictures of us he was by himself just looking around and seemed to be a little bothered that we asked him to take pictures we did buy the maxpass and the photopass comes with it so were not going to waste it by not taking pictures after he took the pictures scanned our card and said okay then walked away no smiles just the i can t wait for my shift to be over look the rides were enjoyable we especially liked hyperspace mountain buzz lightyear matterhorn bobsled millennium falcon awesome interactive ride and splash mountain the only thing that would make it more pleasurable is if the staff were properly trained to be happy we didn t feel that magical experience ,2,2019-07-19
837,Get the Fastpass,disneyland was naturally packed with people but they manage crowds very well and there was never a really long line for food the fastpass is good value for the popular rides compared to other parks but make sure you book the popular rides early as even fastpass was booked out all day on some the indiana jones ride kept breaking down and i have heard this is a regular occurrence ,4,2019-07-19
838,Gr8,been here twice now in years very busy but is a great place to visit all the staff crew members are very cheerful and co operative rides for young and old definitely need or days to ideally do disney and california land ,5,2019-07-19
839,Fabulous,we had a great day at disney the max pass is worth the extra cost park was very clean food and souvenirs were expensive but not surprising as it s disney only downside was having to sit on the ground for fantasmic with a fast pass ,5,2019-07-18
840,Happiest Place Anaheim,you just don t go to disneyland and not close it the light parade and the fountain dance made the whole day worth it save for it everything in disneyland is expensive it is worth it ,5,2019-07-18
841,Sprting trip,omg what fun easy to get around fun place clean happy and helpfull staff grat things for all to do ,5,2019-07-18
842,Galaxy's Edge,lovely staff great rides something for everyone and all ages fireworks and evening shows are fun if you can stay up if you get the chance we went on opening day so i m not sure what the queues will be like go to galaxy s edge get on the millennium falcon it was excellent and try some blue milk or green and try not to upset the storm troopers nice food lots of things to do and overall a great day or couple of days if you re staying for a while ,5,2019-07-18
843,Perfection,everything you could want and more such a magical place i recommend getting fast pass in app on phone ,5,2019-07-17
844,Do not go here if you have toddlers or babies,this place was miserable so hot in july and every ride or character had at least a min wait not exactly baby or toddler friendly plus they charge an arm and a leg i really can t understand why so many people enjoy going here there were so many people there we couldn t get close to a character or the parade everything costs so much really just save your money there are plenty of other things to do in la with babies and toddlers that are more enjoyable for parents and kids ,1,2019-07-17
845,Disappointed ☹️,visit to america for weeks included disneyland for the kids as everyone probably would wow we were disappointed not sure our experience or understanding is what the concept that walt disney led us to believe it was both the kids and us paying for it had dreams that certainly were not fulfilled i understand it s school holiday times and probably peak season but the number of people in the park was unbelievable shops were full toilets full walkways full seating full rides had around hrs wait for each one every ride you had to queue majority of time in the blazing sun no or very little shade no water atomisers anywhere few water bubblers had the fast passes for the rides but turned out to be waist of money as once you booked a time slot for a fast pass you were unable to book anymore until you scanned in for that ride or the booking didn t interfere with any other booking slot because the time booking was so wide the rides crossed over each other very clever way of not allowing you to plan your park day but get more money out if you disneyland is no longer a fantasy land but a very big commercial money making machine i guess you have to do it once in your life but like us prepare to be disappointed they need to see how universal studios look after their guests it would help much better sorry disneyland but you did not deliver a dream merely disappointment you have turned into a commercial money making machine we left feeling like we had been taken advantage of ,3,2019-07-17
846,Not the happiest place in the world,arranged to spend my sons birthday here maybe we picked the wrong park for the day not been to california adventure yet we had rides shut on us and then the monorail went from train to running meaning we spent a lot longer waiting for the tram fastpass is a joke and they need to sort out the system after having express passes at universal found the fastpass method very difficult to use not able to book more than rides at once ended up walking far more than needed getting to timeslots booked once pm came parts of the park were sectioned off ready for the fireworks even some bathrooms we had headed for were closed star wars land was impressive and my favourite area seeing the stormtroopers and chewie walking round and everyone talked in the language good place to be at night too and the fireworks from here were great line for falcon ride was very long we headed there first no fastpass available but people seemed to be jumping the line by going via fastpass line that was there some were family sharing but others had obviously just found the glitch ,3,2019-07-16
847,Continual Magical Memories,disneyland is truly is the happiest place on earth i have visited disneyland countless times and always look forward to my next visit the atmosphere cast members attractions and treats make it easy to forget about the outside world ,5,2019-07-13
848,on Raining day,when it is raining at disneyland most of the rides are closed and they made you buy rain ponchos that costed for adult and for kids of course you have a choice not buying the ponchos and get soaked completely just as a side note the weather forecast lied about the weather and said it was going to be sunny but it ended up pouring a lot of rides were closed and there was no refund or discount from disney you kind of paid for the same price as usual for entering the park but ended up just walking around the park mostly ,3,2019-07-12
849,Disney Magic,i originally thought the cost of day hopper passes was expensive however after hours in the disney park and hours in the california adventure park the seemed to be value for money disney never fails to disappoint when it comes to entertainment the fast passes worked very well for me and we managed to get on all of the major rides at least once the food and drink on site was good quality and again good value for money the fantasmic show was the best we have ever seen in a disney park and the disney fireworks as usual were excellent ,5,2019-07-11
850,What a Racket,disneyland is a corporate rip off i have been going to disneyland since i was a kid and just recently went back since i moved away from california the disney that i remember that was full of magic has left the building to park your car for the day dollars for people for one day the new star trek is just one giant gift shop there is no interaction with anything just look and buy it is just sell sell sell they should be ashamed of themselves ripping off the public like that i won t be back to the quote happiest place on earth ,1,2019-07-09
851,Disneyland fun!,disneyland can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike it offers many fun things to do disney characters dress in costumes for the kids there are lots of food choices and shops everyone should visit disney at least once in their lifetime ,5,2019-07-07
852,Beggars banquet,hello wa are disney and we really need your contribution and by our ridiculously expensive food and toys please ,1,2019-07-04
853,Always a fun and magical place,i really like the place there s lot of cool rides enjoyed the food though its always packed with tourists but there s fast pass available,4,2019-07-03
854,AMAZING!,amazing time whenever i go to disneyland its amazing i ll definitely go back even when im lol ,5,2019-07-03
855,"Another great visit, this time with 3 children",we visited through with one day spent at universal studios and one day at ca adventure had a blast the temperatures were mild s to s and the lines in all but stars wars land were a lot shorted than our previous visits you need to go early and have a plan to do the major rides first the disneyland daily blog has some good worthwhile tips and plans for adults and or kids ,5,2019-07-02
856,Nice and fun visit.,best advice is to get there early enjoyed many of the rides and nice weather as usual paid the extra for the max pass disney sure has everything together well and it is fun for all ,5,2019-07-01
857,Entertaining and fun!. The new Star Wars section is outstanding!,entertaining and fun we were part of a big school group and we hardly waited for any ride for more than minutes which is very very rare for this california park our group consisted of all preschoolers so we stuck to the easy rides in fantasyland adventureland and tomorrowland got a chance to check out the stunning star wars exhibit this is a must see and felt instantly transported to a different place the attention to detail is amazing didn t try any rides though coz this was the only section of the park whcih had long lines ,4,2019-07-01
858,Disappointing,disneyland california adventure park are just simply missing the disney magic there is no feeling of being transported it is just an amusement park we ve been to disney world several times but this was our first trip to disneyland california adventures it will be our last these parks are the stepchildren of disney missing the magic the ultra friendly employees the spirit of fun everywhere you turn and the charming spirit that transports one into a happy place disappointing way to spend a lot of money ,3,2019-06-28
859,Well done ticket experience Disney!,disney s current execution of the ticketing experience is by far the best it has ever been i highly suggest you download the free disneyland app and get familiar with the app about a month before your visit it will help you with admission to the park each day along with helping you to make the most of each day at the parks we found having the tickets loaded on our apps allowed my family to do more than most of the other patrons we were able to plan our days yet still allow for spur of the moment changes if we felt like it ,5,2019-06-28
860,First family vacation to Disneyland in over 10 years,this is our first family vacation to disneyland in over years when my kids were young children they are now young adults i was disappointed with the early entry as only the east side of the park was open early we went on a couple of rides in tomorrowland and wanted to go to big thunder mountain we had to wait minutes for the regular opening when the rest of the park opened i noticed that the east side of the park had longer line ups than the west side highly recommend using the fastpass fp system as much as possible especially during the peak times of the year we got a fp for the fantasmic show that night and there is a sitting only area and the rest are standing only go to the park first thing in the morning as it gets busier as the day goes along and the line ups become longer too my favourite rides in order hyper space mountain big thunder mountain matterhorn bobsled indiana jones pirates of the caribbean gadget s go coaster short ride disney allows you to take a picture of your ride photos we had a day pass where we spent days at each park one day per park would ve been enough but we had a reservation for the new star wars area and it was not during the crazy summer peak season ,5,2019-06-26
861,Not as magical as Walt Disney World,finally our st time to dl it s disney so you cant go wrong but we quickly realized it was no wdw it was great to walk where walt walked and ride some nostalgic rides but the castle was very disappointing and you can feel the crowds in the smaller park this park was very beautiful at night and then we walk out of the park to a group of homeless people and people begging for money which is where it lost its magic when wdw provides a fully immersive experience for what it costs i want to feel like i am in another world ,4,2019-06-26
862,Friendly staff,friendly staff not many products situated in downtown disney a shopping district that leads you to the disney park entrances clean and litter free ,2,2019-06-25
863,Truly is the happiest place on earth,after vacations to walt disney world i finally got to travel to the west coast and visit disneyland for the first time last week it lived up to everything i ve ever read and saw and much much more it s amazing to step into a park that walt immersed himself into with such great detail yes the castle is smaller and the park in general is smaller i can honestly say i prefer it more than magic kingdom buying the maxpass is an absolute lifesaver we never waited more than minutes for a ride all day i was lucky enough to grab a reservation for galaxys edge as well which made the day even greater considering when it opens in walt disney world the lines will be horrendous for years it s such a blessing to visit a disney park and not have to strategize your ride schedule by booking fast passes in advanced i made it a point to ride every original ride i would say a handful of the duplicate rides are better in disneyland than disney world like it s a small world and pirates it was also great going on mr toad again and seeing toontown as they are just distant memories at walt disney world ,5,2019-06-25
864,Excessively overpriced for excruciatingly long waits - better ways to spend your money,my husband and i took two children ages and disneyland park for two days it cost person day we didn t know we would go a nd day when we first bought them for the more adventurous rides the wait averaged an hour on our first visit we went in the evening which i would recommend it was cooler high of during the daytime and we got to see the fireworks this was by far the highlight of the whole experience if you do decide to visit be sure to come in the evening and watch the beautiful fireworks display choreographed to disney songs and some scenes projected onto the castle after that though we waited in line for the matterhorn from pm at which point the ride broke down they gave us fast passes as compensation so here s the scoop on fast passes or max pass you pay per person ostensibly to avoid waiting in line after paying for it i signed up for hyper space mountain at around or pm our fast pass would be effective at pm we didn t plan to be at the park that long but i decided to go with it and sign up for another ride as well only to discover that you can only sign up for one ride at a time the next ride wouldn t be available for our fast pass until pm i ditched the whole idea it s a total waste of on top of the already exorbitant entrance fees in the end the average cost of each ride we went on was or more this doesn t even factor in the high cost of meals in the park ,2,2019-06-22
865,The Happiest Place on Earth,disneyland truly is the happiest place on earth on our recent trip my family of four had a wonderful time this was a graduation trip for my recent hs graduate we were concerned that our trip fell on the opening week of the new star wars galaxy s edge land however we were pleasantly surprised with very low wait times for most attractions we also purchased disney s max pass this allows you to make fast pass reservations from your smart phone as well as get free downloads of any photo pass pictures you have taken as well as ride photos the cost is per person per day in my opinion it was worth every penny it saved us a lot of walking around the parks to the fast pass kiosks as well as giving me access to all the great photo pass shots with characters and other iconic areas around the parks and some great ride photos our trip was wonderful and i highly recommend coming here my family is already planning our next disneyland adventure ,5,2019-06-20
866,What a wonderful time!,we booked park hopper with max pass and photos well worth the extra few dollars definitely youtube videos in which food and drinks to try so you don t miss some secret treats our favorite was the drinks at bingbongs don t miss the macaroons either ,5,2019-06-19
867,Wish I could relive over and over,i had the opportunity to go here with a close friend of mine he had been before and loves it here i followed him around to all his favorite places this park was smaller than i expected but a great disney experience i loved all the shows and rides and atmosphere in general i was only here one day but could have spent several more days to see and do everything ,5,2019-06-18
868,Truly the happiest place on earth,for late somethings we had the time of our lives we got to the main entrance just prior to opening and the whole process was very smooth inside the place is immaculate and fascinating to see the attention to detail is extraordinary the rides themselves are catered for all ages and thrills or lack of thrills depending on what you re after most noticeable was how considerate and helpful the staff cast members are and more than happy to point you in the right direction secure a fast pass from near the frontierland lake for the fantasmic show as early as possible as entry to watch this show is limited also secure a space along main street to watch mickey s soundsational parade indiana jones ride is the most thrilling with favourites like it s a small world and astro orbitors drawing big lines the food is awesome french mark and rancho del zocalo restaurante stay till late am rides close shops close at am ,5,2019-06-16
869,Brings out your inner Kid,disney based theme park and a full on kids paradise however somehow i liked the honk kong disneyland better this one felt small not sure if it really is the rides were also not as exciting if the weather is good then you can enjoy early morning pass was also of no help as it was too crowded make sure to take your own meal and water else be ready to put a hole in that pocket ,4,2019-06-15
870,Out of town family visit,family came out for a visit year old year old plus mom and grandma been there several years before was hoping to have the same excitement i had in the past with my other grandchildren needless to say the price for a one day ticket parking not to mention the price of food yikes get there early hit all the best rides first otherwise you wait in long lines ,4,2019-06-14
871,Where has the magic gone?, to all who come to this happy place welcome well after my third extended stay in anaheim to visit the disney parks i couldn t help but wonder what has happened to walt s vision the numerous rude and unpleasant cast members have certainly contributed to some of the lost magic over the past years disneyland have recently introduced free wi fi throughout the park enabling you to post to social media book your next fastpass and pre order food from anywhere in the park using the disneyland app in theory this is great but in reality all this has done is encourage everyone to walk around with their eyes glued to devices which is far from ideal with the large crowds that the park attracts my family and i were definitely prepared for the large crowds during the christmas and new year period what we were not prepared for was to be continually moved along from events and activities that were promoted for our enjoyment disneyland did a fine job of cramming people into the park but could couldn t handle the crowds it is most disappointing that we couldn t stop to enjoy anything without being instructed to keep walking the rides are excellent and the food available in the park is tasty but after my most recent visit i definitely won t be rushing back ,2,2019-06-14
872,Disappointing,last visited years ago and this visit was very disappointed to find nothing much has changed a majority of the rides are exactly the same only difference is now disney have concentrated mainly on food and merchandise prices are exorbitant and the park is overfilled overcrowded and overpriced to ride the recycled rides and buy their food and merchandise ride times are in excess of two hours for the popular rides and they still let more people in apparently the billion yearly profits are not enough it has just become another tourist trap characters are scarce only seen in one day last time there were about if you have been before give it a miss it s exactly the same with the exception of more shops ,2,2019-06-14
873,Everything to you want,a fantastic park and has stuff for everyone the fanpass is absolutely worth the extra dollars we were able to complete every ride before dinner and then have the evening for completing a second run at things we could not visit the star wars area as we didn t have a reservation but that won t be needed in a few weeks anyway ,5,2019-06-13
874,What more is there to say?,this review is just to add my voice to the chorus of everyone else who loves disney and admires what the company has done with walt s legacy one special note though either the company has a genius for hiring genuinely friendly and upbeat cast to interact with the guests or every cast member i talked to is an oscar worthy actor ,5,2019-06-13
875,Great time,we went on a group trip which included my two children it was my year olds first time and my year olds third they both had a blast my favorite part was after their make overs at bibbidi bobbidi boutique my youngest meet minnie mouse and couldn t stop telling her how much she loved her minnie spent three times more time with her than any other character did also giving her multiple hugs and signing that she loved her too that is the greatest thing my daughter has told everyone she meet minnie when asked what her favorite part of disneyland was my year old and my wife went on every ride and loved it my year old and i went on every kid friendly ride there was it was just worth it ,5,2019-06-13
876,Fabulous time!,we had a fabulous time at disneyland day ticket one park per day ticket california adventure first day disneyland second day kids picked disneyland for third day they just do such a great job and pay attention to every detail great value for the money maxpass is definitely worth it and we re a frugal bunch can t wait to go back in years to experience it again as our kids continue to get older ,5,2019-06-12
877,Vacation with the family,it s the happiest place on earth and with the family lots to do and eat it s been a family vacation for over years ,5,2019-06-12
878,Still so magical,back after years with sons now still the most magical place on earth with very friendly staff rides have been updated to current themes like guardians and music should add pirates and star wars in the disney parade to cater to boys who didn t enjoy watching the princesses worth the money as there are so many rides and ends late at midnight fireworks would have been appreciated more if not for the big tree on the left side ,5,2019-06-12
879,Galaxy Edge -some hints..,we did enjoy our hour visit to batuu you will feel like you are in a totally different land lots of great photo ops but in my opinion galaxy s edge is really not five stars until they get all the batuu resident s completely integrated with the visitors opening issues with crowd control movement straightened out and the rise of the resistance ride opens until june th reservations are required for specific admission times to galaxy s edge when the rope drops for admission of your group everyone heads directly to either smugglers run or the cantina so unless you are right in the front of the admission line wait times soon become increasingly longer as more people in each group arrive and start backing up the line as long as there are hour admission windows if you aren t right in front of the admission line then the shortest wait for smugglers run is after the initial crowd dissipates and the next group is admitted about hours into your admission time smugglers run is like star tours ride combined with toy story mania buzz lightyear only six seats in the cockpit pilots gunners engineers pilot assignment is most fun especially right seat and if your group all interacts with each other then it is much more fun there is much to see and appreciate during your line time wait ,4,2019-06-12
880,1st Disney Trip Ever,family of adults kids we only visited the park day make sure you go early as soon as the park opens we got to see lots of characters coming out most rides had very few people in line souvenir shops open until we bought our mickey ears early before the crowd disney is expensive closed snacks are permitted to bring into the park we took snacks for our toddlers since they are picky we ate around and their was plenty of space when we left lunch at around it was getting very congested with people we ended up leaving around because their we so many people and it was getting very hot outside make sure you buy the dole whip it s a classic ,4,2019-06-11
881,Love love love Galaxy’s Edge,this really is a must see it was so easy to feel immersed on the planet because of all of the details and larger than life structures ,5,2019-06-11
882,The Time of my life,we decided to make an impromptu trip to disneyland we had so much fun we did not have reservations for galaxy edge the newest land the cast members were polite and courteous as they explained we needed wristbands to go through two checkpoints the rest of the park had few visitors we got on all the rides with the longest wait being minutes it truly was a magical visit ,5,2019-06-10
883,Everything you'd hope it would be.,they say it s the happiest place on earth and they re not far off once you ve overcome the price of the place it is all great fun the staff are consummate professionals and spend their time ensuring your safety and comfort the rides are wonderful a few are a bit loud and the park is immaculately clean my year old had the time of her life and will no doubt remember the trip for a long time ,5,2019-06-10
884,The happiest place on Earth!,this is a must do if you are not a local resident of southern california and with the addition of star wars it will be just as amazing make sure to check prices weather and crowds as there are peak days when the park can get congested ,5,2019-06-09
885,California dreams,best time to visit if you are going for summer vacation that would be before the california schools are out for the summer break ,5,2019-06-09
886,California dreams,we ventured through the two parks over two days i m not going to say we did it with ease we had two long days but it was jam packed of fun we visited on a monday and tuesday so the crowds were lower than a weekend the popular rides were up to a minute wait but the fast pass app helped us avoid waiting too long make sure you get a full understanding of fast pass so you maximise its use for rides and photos we didn t ask and missed out on rides on day one take the train and mono rails up first to get an idea of what you want to spend most of your time at two days at a pace work but four days would be ideal now the star wars world is read sad to say we missed it by two weeks ,5,2019-06-09
887,Not only for the kids,a place where no matter what age you are this is a place where all dreams and fantasy are made a place of hope fun and excitement for everyone we had so much fun at disneyland that we will never get bored at it so much love and smiles are spread around thai atmosphere where lots of children s and families are around a great place to remember your childhood time and a place of reconnecting and rekindle time with your children s ,4,2019-06-09
888,Disappointing Customer Service,so much went wrong with my last trip that disney offered me a compensation package of hotel and tickets for two at first i was disappointed because i couldn t afford to accept it after i decided to somehow come up with the money for plane food caregiver etc i was disappointed in disney s hard headedness they would not let me upgrade the hotel and take only one ticket they would not let me spit the second ticket crowds are extremely light right now with galaxy s edge reservation system but they will not let me change hotels the offer is only for the cheapest rooms in paradise pier and they are all booked small crowds like this are never going to happen again and i really wanted to take advantage of the opportunity i m more depressed disillusioned and stressed by the offer of compensation than i was by the multiple problems that led to the offer what really gets me is that someone with money would have been treated a lot better i stayed at a wdw budget hotel and they are never going to let a budget guest stay in a better hotel e hawks ,2,2019-06-08
889,Magical visit!,the first day of my disneyland resort adventure started very early as i had an am reservation to the new star wars galaxy s edge park which recommended arriving up to two hours early which meant a am arrival and a heck of a lot of waiting in line sw ge was a feast for the eyes i really felt like i was walking around a star wars world that said i m really glad i got to be one of the first people to see it but i don t think they should have opened with only one ride operational i rode it three times walked around the area and got some photos and was done in about two hours which worked out nicely as it gave me more time to experience the rest of disneyland park walt s vision which opened in is huge and you can quickly wear yourself out if you re not strategic about your route i logged about km steps walking around that day i had the maxpass allowing me to reserve fastpasses on the fly i was a single rider several rides had shortcuts for single riders a definite plus and aside from sw ge the park wasn t too busy in the morning it was kind of crappy out which suited me just fine so i got to ride just about everything numerous rides were similar to ones found at disney world but matterhorn bobsleds similar to disneyworld s expedition everest was my favourite i was too tired by pm that i headed back to my hotel with the intention of heading back for the nighttime shows and maybe some nighttime rides the park was open until midnight but i was too zonked from a day full of fun ,5,2019-06-08
890,"Broken rides, massive lines",the following rides broke while we were in line costing us hours of wait time in total fireworks yes indiana jones twice materhorn car s race hyperspace mountain twice over two hours waiting will never go to disneyland again disneyworld sure never here ,1,2019-06-08
891,Go to Disneyworld instead... what a piece of junk!,ok we got into galaxy s edge that s a star omg best thing ever kind of review but that s where it ends disney has no clue how to do fast passes i d strongly suggest you only ride rides with fast passes if and only if you have a fast pass why because when you are waiting in the minute line invariably every ride breaks in that time and the fast passers are all let in way before you happened to us many times see list below we waited over hours to get into hyperspace mountain the parks are really not in good shape go to disneyworld and everything is clean and well kept go to disneyland and sure cherishing walt s original view of the park is great but seeing the paint he saw years ago now faded and peeling no don t think that s what he meant the layout is horrible we paid the ultra premium price to stay at paradise pier nope never again see that review but still you have to walk miles to get to the entrance of the parks you know how bad your feet hurt not imagine it doubled because your hotel offers no shuttle no bus no monorail nope just walk now you don t just walk to the park you have to meander through downtown disney the entire thing so it isn t a straight line even the monorail don t get me started if you ve been to disneyworld you ve seen how they can actually move a lot of people around fast here the monorail is just a terrible ride that is operated to be as ineffecient as possible again to make you walk through downtown disney to sell more stuff by time it loads and waits and waits then drives over then has to stop for a temporary old every time we took it then stops then moves and inch another inch woops back an inch now open the doors you should have just taking a pain pill and walked it in my business we teach our team member stage presence an idea we got from disney years ago you are essentially on a stage performing for the customer at disney we got to overhear personal conversations about when does your shift end and once even two cast member should just call them employees on guardians of the galaxy talking about another cast member killed in a car accident wow that place sure is magical i will never go again disneyworld sure land nope after about the th thing broke i started keeping a list indiana jones twice materhorn cars ride the race hyperspace mountain twice elevator in our hotel yea see that review ,1,2019-06-08
892,Spectacular place,when i got to orangecounty my cousin recommended me to visit there first i hesitated i thoughvits a place fun for kid but believe me its a must place to go rememorise all the cartoons charactors with nice carnavals on the evening and fire works and sparkes at last will amuse you whole day ,5,2019-06-08
893,Star Wars opening weekend,i booked my trip hoping to avoid the crazy times of star wars opening however disney decided to open it up early i was anxious about the visit but turned out to be great disney was prepared got the work out and the parks were actually really quiet and i could walk on most anything multiple times the reservation system for star wars was great i was lucky to get one for a day during my stay as they go forward doing a virtual que or reservation to super popular rides or areas is a great idea star wars galaxy edge was amazing felt like i as in the movie riding smugglers run was so exciting and entertaining i had a night reservation which was beautiful but there is so many details i would have liked to see it longer in day light also the blue milk was good ,5,2019-06-07
894,California/Nevada Road Trip,we wanted to visit as we have great memories of our st visit and with our girls obviously it has changed as it is over years since the original however they do not really cater for the older generation which is disappointing as a lot of grandparents would like to in on their own like us but due to health problems cannot go on all the rides also no senior discount so we had to pay each to get in why oh why cannot they due a senior pass which only allows the more gentle rides and does not allow you on the coasters etc we would also spend money on gifts for family etc and eat as well so they would still make money out of us however after my little moan it was still great to go round and see everyone enjoying themselves and some good new rides pity star wars was nut up and running the only part we were disappointed with was downtown disney think the one in florida is far superior with things to like cirque de soliel hard rock etc ,5,2019-06-07
895,Galaxy’s Edge,we received a reservation because we stayed at the grand californian this is true for the other on property hotels but only until june or our reservation was for am on wed no extra magic hour we arrived at the main gate at am they starting letting us into the park right away we along with everyone else walked to star wars launch bay everyone said this was quick but the system was down so we waited a while after being checked in we went upstairs to check out the merchandise when we came down we learned that they were holding everyone in tomorrowland this would not be possible with the other times the galactic grille was open so my bf got in line while the kids and i grabbed food and then we joined him the queue got huge and we were glad to be at the front at am disney staff walked us from tomorrow land to batuu it was amazing we got in line right away for oga s cantina because if you don t get in line you may not get in at all we waited about min and then got in it was cool but honestly unless this is something you ve been dreaming about it s ok to miss docking bay has a really cool vibe too just no alcohol after oga s we rode the millenium falcon there was a minute line when we got off the line was down to so we rode again after my bf and i decided to go again and went as single riders and practically walked on the ride is a cockpit with three single seats on each side as you come to the final boarding area cast members hand you a ticket that says engineer shooter or pilot my kids got to do pilot twice i was an engineer and a gunner but put my gun on automatic so i could enjoy there ride i could have ridden a few more times there was tons of shopping and we didn t even attempt to build lights savers or droids my bf amd kids had so much fun with the datapad loads automatically from disneyland app running missions and hacking everything be sure to download the app before you come to the park and also be sure to bring a batter pack and charging cord for each member of the family our two hours went by way too fast one more tip we did the maxpass which was awesome i made the reservations from my phone but everyone wore their tickets on their lanyard so we redeemed with those also made it handy when i left my phone on the room and we just quick linked the tickets to my bf s phone the disneyland classic rides seemed to have short lines and we could get fast passes for big rides all evening california adventure ran out of fast passes in the evening for nearly all the rides fortunately we had done them early on our first day ,5,2019-06-07
896,Disneyland Always Fun,return visit tickets and products seem much more expensive an expensive option with the aussie dollar in the doldrums neighbourhood not as clean as our last visit and lots of people on streets many of whom seem very distressed overall we had lots of fun ,4,2019-06-06
897,Amazing!,i visited star wars galaxy s edge with my husband and eight year old son during the soft opening advance reservations are required during the soft opening and are sold out however if you book a room at a disney property you are guaranteed a reservation the land will open to all disneyland guests later in june disney spent a billion dollars on star wars land and it shows they paid attention to every detail you feel like you landed on another planet there are no movie set type facades you can t tell that you re within a theme park only one ride is open now with a second ride to open at a later time currently under construction the millennium falcon ride includes a walk through experience with photo ops followed by the ride a crew of six is taken to the falcon cockpit you are assigned the role of pilot engineer or gunner you are guided through a mission and given tasks as you look out the windshield of the falcon it feels like you re flying the wait was initially an hour but it dropped to minutes the wait time is available on the dl app there is no fastpass at this time we were on the wait list for the cantina but it was a three hour wait and so we did not experience it they will text you if when you can enter you have a minute window to enter once you receive the text we tried some of the food from the food stalls the blue milk is a non dairy frozen smoothie with a fruit flavor the rondo roaster is a spicy sausage and roasted pork with slaw in a soft pita it s good if you like spicy the popcorn at kat s is a delicious sweet and savory mix and is available with or without the souvenir droid popcorn bucket the coca cola brand soft drinks come in awesome themed bottles using the dl app to order food saved us from standing in long lines it s worth visiting even if you just walk around and take photos chewbacca was there and interacted with some of the guests we were there in the evening and had a fantastic view of the fireworks we ll be back ,5,2019-06-06
898,Magical Fun in Magic Kingdom,my husband and i went to disneyland last month with our daughter son in law and their three kids ages and we had fast passes and learned to use them efficiently so the waiting time was minimal we had so much fun and created forever memories with our grandkids the cast members were almost all friendly and helpful and the presence of so many characters in costume added to the experience my one complaint is about the helium balloons i saw so many floating away from children as well as the vendors selling them all three days we were there having seen way too many photos of dead sea turtles and whales full of plastic i think it s beyond time to eliminate the balloons disneyland is too near to the ocean to risk so many balloons landing in the wrong places i was heart sick every time i saw yet another stray balloon taking to the sky this must change otherwise we enjoyed every single moment of our time there ,5,2019-06-06
899,Good,kids enjoyed pop soda costs the same in the restaurants v s at kiosks kiosks sell bottles restaurants have the machines the restaurants you get up to free refills more bang for your buck ,4,2019-06-06
900,Disney....,attended disney institute and disneyland great time great food and excellent experience well done disney ,5,2019-06-06
901,fun for the kids,great day out parking was offsite and required a shuttle to get to the park make sure you get in early and take the maxi pass,5,2019-06-05
902,Great day !,love the fast past for a little as each day it was so worth it great park love indiana jones ride small world at night is amazing family had a ball ,4,2019-06-05
903,Disneyland IS Magic!,disneyland is magical for these reasons it is so clean despite all the consumption you rarely see any litter but the real magic is you do not see sullen employees with tongs and dustpans so who is doing it elves it is a commercial marvel disneyland supports a huge economy castmembers bus drivers security neighbouring hotels and businesses which solely exist for disneyland patronage it is mighty impressive it is accessible so many rides are wheelchair accessible amazing you will see all sorts of children here screaming crying laughing or dazed from fear hunger excitement or exhaustion and yet i have not seen one fight or argument amongst patrons generally everyone i see leaving the gates at the end of the evening are still in a good mood despite all the stresses of the day despite already paying a hefty ticket price for the park airfare and accommodations you just can t help but throw more at the establishment for the awesome swag a magnetic groot on your shoulder so cute pin trading can get obsessive build your own light sabre yes please all with great customer service our light sabre crapped out when we got home one email to disney guest services contact info on receipt with our supporting documentation and a new one was sent to us in the mail free of charge and shipping the best way to have a mediocre time at disneyland is to arrive cold turkey researching ahead of time will save you and time and an overall crappy time at the park tips there are always discounts available online i e certain seasons canadians can enjoy a lower rate costco sells tickets and i m sure there are more never pay at the gate research which rides you really want to go and whether there is fastpass height restrictions and seats so the littles ones are not waiting in line forever only to be disappointed there are some fastpasses that run out by mid day so get these early paper fastpasses are free not really sure why more people don t use them memorize the washrooms and park map i had prepared a target itinerary but kept it flexible as things change knowing where everything was really helped me to change our plans on the fly and where to meet up you could meander around without a plan but you will probably end up waiting longer than you should or not getting to the attractions at all that would have made your visit awesome last of all yes this is not the taj mahal or the pyramids but disneyland is a modern day north american miracle the amount of and creative effort that went into this park is unbelievable take this in stride suspend your belief for a while and just enjoy the ride ,5,2019-06-05
904,My Happy Place,i absolutely love disneyland it just has such a happy feeling all around everything is so clean and they cater to every age and every food requirements i would plan on going for the full day and take snacks and drinks we used to have the california annual pass and we used it to the fullest ,5,2019-06-05
905,eh...,it was ok i guess the lines were veryyyyyyyy long and apparently i am too old to meet minnie mouse i am only and i went on all the rides and broke my back i will only return if my wife linda will come with me she diedin ,2,2019-06-05
906,Star Wars,we got a sneak peek at the new star wars park it isn t fully completed yet but what was finished was a marvel incredible attention to detail creativity is all around you in terms of food beverage merchandise characters etc many friends enjoyed the ride and had rave reviews since it was so different from other rides ,5,2019-06-05
907,Disneyland is a place for all ages!,coming to disneyland several times as a kid before and now with my own kids with me it truly is a magical place the attraction never gets old seeing mickey mouse and the rest of the gang is always a treat now with new attractions mixed in with the regular favorites makes it a place for both parents and kids alike one should never miss a trip to disneyland when they visit california ,5,2019-06-04
908,2 Days And So Much More To See,my first time visiting i very much enjoyed our visit and would love to go back after days i felt like we barely scratched the surface we went after labor day when we expected it to be slow and it still got a little crowded at a popular ride at peak times you can spend a long time in line one odd thing i expected to just run into characters but they all had scheduled spots and lines ,4,2019-06-04
909,Supervisor needs more training,i have been working in hospitality business for almost decades and for the first time i have encountered a supervisor named chris from rowland heights at the main entrance who seemed not to care about my situation my son who is presently serving in the military surprised us by visiting us for a couple of days last memorial weekend he took us to disneyland for our family to bond and have a good time upon entering the park and walked to space mountain ride to get the fast pass my daughter s ticket had a problem so we asked someone on what to do a lady informed us to just bring the her ticket to the front so they can re scan it i asked my son just to take some other rides so they went to autopia when my wife and i reached the front gate i spoke to chris and he didn t apologize for what had happened he only said and i quote your daughter must be here at the gate i explained to him that my son and daughter were both went to fall in line to a different ride and time was very important for us i mentioned to him also that the lady by the space mountain only informed us to take the ticket at the front gate for re scanning without any feelings or care chris just informed us that our daughter must be present and he cannot do anything even if our daughter was already inside the park he just offered us a fast pass and that was it never did own the problem or apologize being the supervisor i don t know how long you ve been working there chris but you have to at least smile or apologize for what had happened to my daughter s ticket because i don t want other families to go to the happiest place on earth and have the same experience that we had a smile is the prettiest thing you can wear ,1,2019-06-04
910,A wonderful 12 1/2 hours in Disney Los Angeles,for two oldies in out s we had a wonderful experience we could have hired a motorized wheel chair if we had wanted plenty of ramps for easy access queues were not too long most people had bought fast pass but as we weren t going on many rides so we didn t bother plenty of food outlets where we could rest so good to see all the happy people just enjoying themselves and everyone was respectful keep a watch out for parade times and get a good view lots of characters walking around prices of disney items are quite high especially with conversion rates from australian and being april the fireworks were not too late but the fantastic evening show was cancelled due to slight wind which was disappointing always check to see if the show is on during your stay ,5,2019-06-04
911,One of the greatest places,if you re an adult or a child this is a place you would need to see if you re traveling to california theres something there for everyone you will not regret it ,5,2019-06-04
912,A fun day at the park that set the standard for all that came after!,if you can make it for christmas season it is the best time to visit you can t really appreciate how awesome the season is if you haven t seen it ,5,2019-06-04
913,3 day ticket - 1 park per day,i brought my family to disneyland anaheim in may to celebrate my daughters st birthday she chose this destination because she loves disney so we ve gone often we had fun again but were disappointed when so many rides were broken down in addition we got stuck on a ride for minutes and didn t even get an apology years ago when a ride broke down while we were on it they gave us a fast pass for any ride also on our rd day we decided to arrive later and got to the park at pm only to learn that most rides were blocked from us to facilitate the local grads there was no mention of this when we were booking our tickets or at the gate entrance it was very disappointing for our trip to end like that the smaller rides that didn t interest the teens were crowded with huge lineups i know disneyland is never going to cap the number of people they allow in the park but it feels like the level of customer service has gone down maybe they re just getting overwhelmed ,2,2019-06-04
914,Classic Disney - A few observations for WDW fans,so yes you must visit disneyland i will not belabor the details there are many good blogs and books that will give you way more information than you can imagine on the parks and i do recommend you check them out before your trip never try to just wing it at any disney park you will spend hours at the park trying to figure out stuff when you should be enjoying the experience a little planning helps to ensure you don t miss something because it was sold out in advance reservations needed or something special was going on and you were not aware before arriving my advice is to start planning at least months in advance i will make a few observations for those who like me come from the east coast of the us and have visited walt disney world many times but never disneyland and you are wondering if disneyland is different and if it s worth your time and money generally speaking in my humble opinion walt disney word in florida is better but of course it s both newer and much bigger with many more parks so if it s just the general experience you are going for wdw is your best bet however if you love all things disney then of course disneyland is the original and you need to visit but you knew that already disneyland does have a unique second park which honestly should just be part of the same park called disney s california adventure dca for short if you have visited wdw you may be unimpressed with the original disneyland park itself as it s basically a smaller version of the one in wdw although again you must visit but california adventure is unique and has lots of stuff that you will not see anywhere else and certainly not in wdw so rest assured that if you do visit disneyland after wdw you will experience new things is it worth the expense to visit if you are coming from the east coast on it s own i don t think so if you just want to fly to california to visit disneyland and then fly home i d tell you to save your money however if you come to california see some of the state and then visit disneyland as a part of that trip then i would say that makes sense as california is a wonderful state to visit finally a note to wdw regulars that have never visited there are a lot of annual pass holders called ap s that visit disneyland unlike wdw where most of the guests are there for a vacation at disneyland the guest are visiting more like folks at your local zoo or park because of this they have a different attitude many times i was waiting in a long line for a ride and someone would just walk by ditching me and everyone else their excuse every time was oh i am just moving up with my family or someone else i know this happened many countless times i spoke with disney cast members about this because i was upset and they told me that line ditching was normal at disneyland that the park had a different attitude than at wdw now i understand a different vibe but when i ve spent a lot of my hard earned money and vacation time to fly across the country with my family to wait in line at disneyland for an attraction only to have people cut the line over and over again well naturally i m not going to be happy with that experience i d challenge disney to do something about this because regardless the attitude of the park ditching other people who were already in line is simply not acceptable i d also suggest that if you are visiting and find that disney still accepts this practive that you take full advantage of disney s approach and move yourself to the front of every line because if you are visiting from out of town on your once in a lifetime trip you should certainly take advantage of every opportunity you can get overall i m a disney fan and so i enjoyed my visit hopefully you will find my comments and suggestions helpful ,4,2019-06-04
915,Disney Experience,we have been to disneyland times before our last trip our kids are getting older and we wanted to try a new experience at disneyland wow in disney fashion the breakfast met and exceeded our expectations yes it is costly but well worth the my daughters are already planning our next trip and the character breakfast is on the top of the must do list ,5,2019-06-04
916,Galaxy Edge,currently here on an am pm reservation spent the night at grand hotel and purchased day max pass at am both the build your own saber and the cantina were sold out what a great disappointment and some of the people were less than nice millennial falcon was awesome ,2,2019-06-04
917,Lot's of Fun Except for Line-ups!,my sweetie had never been to disneyland and although we are now both seniors having been to both disneyland and disneyworld in florida with my boys i wanted her to experience it it would be an understatement to say she thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it at times on some of the rides she looked like she was a kid again a few of our favorites were mickey s soundsational parade toon town with mickey minnie s houses including pluto s dog house and the roger rabbit spin late night fireworks mickey s mixed magic star tours indiana jones raiders splash mountain etc we spent day and day at disneyland our nd day at the california adventure park included car land and the radiator springs car ride hollywood street and the guardians of the galaxy drop pixar pier was neat to walk around and have a drink and a bite we had made reservations at wine country trattoria and ralph brennan s jazz kitchen in downtown disney for the rd day both were good although expensive our only disappointment was sleeping beauty s castle probably disney s most famous icon was closed for renovations i would have also liked to see star wars galaxy s edge but it doesn t open until the summer of also when we went through security they found my spyderco pocket knife i had put it in my bag the night before so as not to take it in my jeans to the house of blues it was a gift from my brother so i hated to give it up disneyland had no means of keeping it until we left so so much for disney hospitality it was a ways back to the hotel and we were anxious to get going because it was late morning already so i let it go thinking i could buy another one for about it turns out it s us to replace it ,5,2019-06-03
918,Loads of fun even as an adult.,don t bring selfie sticks they will confiscate them at the gate bring your own water and snacks if you can because food and beverages are expensive pay the extra for a fast pass make sure you use it for the more popular rides as soon as you can consider bringing ear plugs as some of the rides have really loud speakers for music and whatnot ,4,2019-06-03
919,What a magical place!!!,we had such a wonderful time truly magical we loved the frozen show and fantasmic the character breakfast was also great each one took time with each child food was also good maxpass is well wroth the money a lot of the rides are just like disney world which was nice ,5,2019-06-03
920,We had such a wonderful time. .,good rides for kids between years but older siblings can enjoy as well fast pass is wonderful and the picture process is super easy check youtube for education on the process ,5,2019-06-02
921,First visit,there is so much to do its amazing it truly is the happiest place on earth the rides alone will keep you busy for the day thanks there s food plays performances characters and more pro tip get the max pass unlimited high quality pictures and ride planning ,4,2019-06-02
922,So much fun,we loved disneyland the characters the rides the food and the fun some queues were long but we waited them out used some fast passes and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves wish we were still there very glad to have a pushchair not only for the year old but to use like a shopping trolley ha ha ,5,2019-06-02
923,4 Day Pass .......yehaaaaaaa,we recently spent days in disneyland the half day was spent in california adventure the things we really enjoyed were carsland it is just like walking into the movie incredicoaster ferris wheel pictures with characters and many other events our full day in disneyland did not disappoint highlights included but were not limited to the haunted house guardians of the galaxy ride hyperspace mountain the indiana jones ride and lots of character sightings highly recommend ,5,2019-06-01
924,Great Memories,we had a blast you must buy the maxpass which includes the fastpass and photo downloads it s per person per day but so worth it in essence you are standing in two lines at once with this option use the single rider option to go on even more rides hyperspace mountain has been completely revamped with a star wars theme and it is incredible star tours has also been redone and is worth a wait in line you can bring water and snacks into the park see website for guidelines to save some money food in the park is out of this world expensive hot dog chips and a soda is didn t get a chance to see the new star wars land because getting a reservation is near impossible but i m sure we ll be back to see it ,5,2019-06-01
925,Worlds Happiest Place is not an exaggeration!,this was my first trip to disneyland at years old a first for our daughter and her cousin too and years my husband had been twice before i wasn t all that excited about the trip but i loved disneyland amazing just as i imagined it when i was a child just bigger and better we only spent one day here but we made the most of it we had a magic morning pass so we went in at am took a break for a couple of hours around pm and we got home pm managed pretty much everything we wanted to ride visit experience but could definitely have spent another full day here we had a day one park per day pass we only arrived to anaheim late afternoon on first day so used our first day pass to enter the park very late at night this was a good idea as we didn t have another day to use the ticket and this way we were all set up to enter the parks first thing in the morning you have to get the actual tickets we only had a printed paper from our travel agent and have your photo taken at the entry gates definitely recommend paying extra for the maxpass pass you not only get the fast pass which you can arrange on the app on your phone but it includes all photos taken on rides and by the offical park photographers this is an awesome deal as you get your money back almost instantly we would ve saved hours of time waiting in lines there were several rides we were going to skip because even fastpass looked like it would take hours to wait for availability but keep checking in and often closer times come available you got to have the maxpass believe me and at each this is a bargain compare that to approx each for fastpass at knotsberry which doesn t include photos don t miss the shows there are quite a few throughout the day night the evening light shows are amazing food and drinks can be expensive so plan ahead the staff do an amazing job it s so clean and beautiful the sheer number of people visiting is astounding but this is definitely the happiest place on earth ,5,2019-06-01
926,Amazing!,my family made my dream come true this past february when they took us to disneyland resort for days it was impresive more than i thought it would be the parks are so big i thought i would be able to visit all in hours how wrong i was you need more than days to know it all it is one of the best experiences of my life super recommended ,5,2019-06-01
927,Great time,it s disneyland do it is s very nice park with plenty to do for the whole family get the fast pass and use it wisely one day it was the best thing to have the second day we were only able to use it once they have limited times you can use it one ride at a time i get that if they did not do it that way there would be long waits even with the pass so just plan right and you ll be good to go just expect to spend lots of dough if you eat in the park the food is very good so no issues there you ll just be paying a lot,4,2019-05-30
928,Great visit,always is a really nice to go into a disney park although i think some games need some renovation they are pretty old and everything is very expensive ,4,2019-05-30
929,Not as magical as disneyworld,did not feel the magic here there were no photographers anywhere workers were rude had a girl role her eyes on splash mountain because we didn t want to put our and yr on alone didn t know it was a single rider one would not go back as for my family and i we prefer disney world more so if you re debating between the two go for disneyworld ,2,2019-05-30
930,"Fun time, clean park, friendly staff",went here this time as a chaperone for a field trip with young teenagers about age we had park hopper tickets everyone had a great time also the wait times on the disney app seemed surprisingly accurate lots to do for all age groups there are fewer crowds in the morning it seemed to get busier as the day went on but it was still manageable note it was a weekday ,5,2019-05-30
931,"Had a great time, even as an adult",was a shame the castle was under construction hang on tight in indiana jones it s a rough ride had a terrific time even as an adult ,5,2019-05-29
932,Amusement also for the adults,definitely disneyland it is not only for children you can find yourself enjoying the games and amusement houses a lot of things to see and do,5,2019-05-29
933,Nice place,we love disney and thoroughly enjoyed disneyland the park isn t cheap but there is plenty to do for your money ,5,2019-05-29
934,#BirthdaySquad,amazing trip to celebrate our birthdays as a family my son s first time and he loved ever minute of it fantasmic was the most amazing show we have ever seen this is a must see when visiting,5,2019-05-29
935,Family visit for a memorable Day at D-Land,what is to say the re opened the castle a few days ago star wars just opened too don t miss the parade get good spot early worth the wait buy the fast pass one of the best investments you can make lots of hotels within walking distance or park nearby and take the shuttle bus always memorable especially for a st timer be sure to get a st visit pin ,5,2019-05-28
936,It was great to be a kid again!,this was my first trip to disneyland california adventure park and it did not disappoint we had an amazing time we were prepared for crowds i m not a fan of lots of people so i have to mentally prepare also for standing in some lines but we really didn t have too much trouble with either our first day was good friday we got to the park at shortly after am expecting it to be crazy busy as it was a holiday however we were pleasantly surprised saw a few characters right inside the park went on rides back to back with little to no wait some of the rides had a bit longer wait time we waited minutes in toon town for one of the rides even when we went back with our friends on easter sunday the wait times for rides weren t bad we did learn how to use fast pass for a few rides to help with wait times on our favorite rides the busiest with crowds we encountered was in the evening during the light show fireworks but these are so fantastic i didn t even mind the crowds i recommend standing on the bridge for these as you can see everything no ones head is in the way so magical in california adventure park the hottest ride is cars which we didn t do as the wait time was over hrs although it looked like fun we weren t interested in waiting that long the incredibles roller coaster was awesome and i m not a fan of roller coasters but this was great the water rafting ride was also great especially on a hot day just wear clothes that dry fast it was all worth every penny the sore feet from walking bring good walking shoes the waiting in line for rides parade ice cream or pictures with characters they all do such an amazing job made my birthday and st visit unforgettable ,5,2019-05-28
937,Annual Pass Holder,love it here i have an annual pass and go like once a month my pass is worth every penny my friend with her kids got passes too and she loves it too ,5,2019-05-28
938,Average experience,having been to disneyland in hong kong paris our expectations were higher from california the adventure park was better with some rides however the system of fast pass was a disappointment because we had to wait and wait and wait in lines and ended up in exploring just a little portion of the park too crowded and less focus on customer service we were group of people including children been to legoland and universal prior to coming here and clearly the former two are way above the mark in terms of customer experiences ,3,2019-05-28
939,Get the maxpass!!!,disney original park great use of space rides and restaurants well done we started at and left at max pass was awesome and with a lot of walking we rode everything but rides ,5,2019-05-27
940,Amazing Place,we visited for two days as part of a day park hopper ticket purchased in advance which will save you money we parked in the toy story car park on both days and yes expensive at dollars per day organisation was great and lots of buses which take to minutes depending on traffic no wait at all even after leaving after fantasmic show our fav rides were splash mountain you will get wet indian jones tempel of forbadien eye is amazing pirates of carabien is fab loved space mountian fast pases a must to avoid long ques reseravaions in advance a must to if you want to eat at the sit down restaurants fantastimic is a must show it is amazing runaway mine train fab especially riding at night overall fab visit we will be back next year,5,2019-05-27
941,It's Disney!,you can t beat a day at disney ignore the crowds and enjoy the experience use the fastpass system ,5,2019-05-27
942,Fantasyland adventure,great combination of old and new characters loved the little train to get around the parade was great the food was good the trek from the parking via shuttle made it a long day it would be much easier if the shuttles dropped off it felt frantic inside and the crowds didn t seem to know where to go some of the food places are hidden away and the secret paths between lands need to be highlighted we got stuck in the future trying to get to fantasyland at one point ,5,2019-05-26
943,"Disneyland is always fun, but so crowded!",we had a really nice day at disneyland i would never do it without a fastpass though the lines were so long on a sunday but we ve found them just as long on weekdays in recent years there are still tons of strollers all over the park but they seem to not be as bad as previous visits the parades really mess up the day in my opinion streets are blocked and it gets so hard to get around there were several rides that we never got to go on even with the fastpass overall though it was a lot of fun i honestly don t know how people with children can afford to go there admission food souvenirs it costs a fortune it rained the day we went but the crowds were still ridiculous oh i do wonder why some of the rides are so dark lately like the haunted mansion you can hardly see the details the lights are turned down so low what s with that ,3,2019-05-26
944,Poor planning for weather problems,we had one day to spend in california and decided on disneyland adults and a child we spent a considerable amount of money just getting a shuttle there not to mention the expensive entrance fees we arrived and waited in long queues for security and at this stage the weather was stunning we managed to do the safari ride and the dumbo ride and then all hell broke loose thunder and lightening and there was no where to shelter people were standing under anything that could provide any relief from the elements shops were full and people standing in the doorways meant you couldn t get in we stood for over an hour underneath the monorail bridge with about other people until a bolt of lightening hit close by and we decided to try to get away obviously for safety all the rides closed down there was no where to eat and by pm we were cold wet and hungry at for a wet weather poncho the park made a killing in profits while our entire day was ruined with no rides and no food with a time frame for our shuttle to pick us up again we had no choice but to leave the park with only having done two kiddies rides not eaten and no souvenirs it was a complete waste of money disney definitely didn t deliver on any promises and it certainly wasn t the happiest place on earth so disappointing they need to start getting some wet weather options available but at the very least make large areas for shelter so we can actually be safe ,2,2019-05-26
945,Great Park,much like the adventure park getting there early when the park opens will allow you to get on the most popular rides with very little wait time this park seemed to be more crowded than the adventure park but there is a ton to do and see here fast pass is the way to go to help cut down your time waiting in line ,4,2019-05-25
946,Halloween Fun,disneyland halloween party was lit recommend it we had a variety of ages and it was fun get their early so you can do california adventure before the party ,5,2019-05-25
947,👍👍👍,lover of anything disney so it was wonderful food was just ok beer and wine in california adventure only alcoholic beverages will be available in disneyland when the new star wars area opens there were larger crowds than we expected at the tme of year we went ,5,2019-05-25
948,first time visit,we visited from nc the first time last week and had a wonderful time everything was great except they need to have the scooter w c and stroller rentals nearer to the trams by the time you work from the trams to the rental area you are already tired the meal deals for the different attractions where nice but for the money they need to offer more selections it helped that we had been to disney world because they are set up similar ,4,2019-05-25
949,Terrible,we had a great trip it seems like disney has gotten much more efficient and we got through the rides much quicker the only complaint is there s a fine line between being efficient and being rude their was one point where i saw an employee being pretty rude to a young boy trying to get off of space mountain but all in all great job disneyland ,1,2019-05-25
950,Grandma grand daughter trip!!,its our second visit to this place first was and now the second thanks a lot to the stuff they do amazing job to keep everything running smoothly and clean the only suggestion there is no healthy food coffee shop its such a business opportunity we were looking for fresh fruts and greek yougurt in legoland wee found such place but not in disneyland please somebody make it happen its california and half of fruts in calgary from there ,5,2019-05-24
951,Kids paradize.,visited with family this week great place to see and probably worth the entrance fee however food and drink very overpriced which makes it a very costly day out it s definitely worth going but if you have a small family don t expect much change from ,5,2019-05-24
952,Nice visit but overpriced food and drink,our family has been vacationing at disneyland for many years and it never disappoints disneyland has always gone beyond other typical theme parks focus on fast thrill rides adequate food choices and simply themed entertainment there is truly something for everyone and the quality is so evident down to each detail food choices range from simple snacks to fine dining through out the park cleanliness and friendly helpful employees are major differences i always appreciate about disneyland in comparison to other non disney themed parks these things have really made a huge difference in creating the wonderful experience our family has had each time we have gone disneyland has a variety of rides to please anyone seeking a thrill or a fairytale journey with sophisticated imagination incorporated entertainment is unsurpassed with vocalists and characters throughout the park parades nighttime fireworks extravaganzas fantasmic and more our family has grown up loving the memories we have made at this magical place ,4,2019-05-24
953,Disneyland a Park for Everyone,we visited disneyland as a graduation gift for my sister and took her children disneyland was just so fun we had the fast pass so we were able to go on indiana jones pirates of the caribbean hyperspace mountain and others more the children enjoyed the parade and were able to see mickey and minnie mouse we all enjoyed our time at disneyland ,5,2019-05-24
954,Fun time with family at Disneyland,this is disneyland the mother of all theme parks the ride are great it is expensive but that is what you get ,5,2019-05-24
955,"It ain't Disney World, but still",wish i could afford to go more often since i do live in the area i have so much fun each visit will make another visit when star wars opens ,5,2019-05-23
956,Always a great experience,we enjoyed re visiting disneyland and had lots of fun spent the whole day in the park and did not rush in the different rides ,5,2019-05-22
957,Crowded and outdated,other than the upcoming star wars land the place is outdated it is overcrowded and fast pass is almost as slow as regular lines single rider lines always closing at the whim of the rude cast members sad it has become so un disney like here,3,2019-05-22
958,Bad Crisis Management,the happiest place in the world is perhaps the worst place when it comes to crisis management here i am sitting on a small boat with my family in the pirates of the carrebean ride and the ride has stopped suddenly more than minutes have elapsed and there is no sign of any move to get us out they simply announce that we have to sit in our seats and that s it no staff to help in the site no water that s pretty poor performance for the happiest place in the world i must say as i write this we are still waiting in a small boat in a dark tunnel waiting for help get us out please i want to visit the rest room and get some water ,1,2019-05-21
959,Favourite place,this is my absolute favourite place in the world i ve come every year at the same time for seven years straight and not one moment have i been sick of it there s so much to do here that its a place for everyone ,5,2019-05-20
960,Disneyland Park,i almost can t believe this in an option to review disneyland holds such a soft spot in my heart from visiting as a child to my senior trip in high school to my honeymoon and then taking my own children there and magically having my children return the favor and treat me to a trip magic simply magic ,5,2019-05-19
961,Slightly disappointed,we took our and year old daughters to ca for spring break we flew into san diego diego spent the first two days at legoland before surprising the girls with disney this was my second time at the park and the first for my kids as a young adult guest years ago it truly did seem like the most magical place on earth i remember the fireworks at the end of the night being the most impressive i ve ever seen however traveling with children provided a much different experience to be honest these are my adult thoughts i believe they enjoyed themselves my problem was with paying a small fortune for admission only to find the castle was closed maybe i was supposed to search online to find this out but in calling disney the day prior being on a long hold and listening to their hold spiel they never mentioned any renovations and it wasn t posted at the gate either maybe i m expecting too much in disney s full disclosure before i spent my money also i paid for the maxpass for the photos it was great i instantly possessed my photos and loved that feature we hung out wasted time in toontown after standing in line for what felt like forever to meet mickey so that we could ride the roger rabbit ride only for it to malfunction right as we re assigned a boarding lane we were told we d be compensated via the app but every time i tried to do this the app crashed so that ended our maxpass use it was also disappointing that there were no fireworks at the end of the night instead they displayed cartoons to music down mainstreet usa it was ok but not as cool as the fireworks i remember what i give credit to disneyland for are the character interactions tigger and pooh were fantastic making time for both of my girls to not only take photos but also interact with them outside of the maxpass malfunction castle being closed and no fireworks navigating the park with a stroller and the stroller parking lots were not fun but a component of parentlife,3,2019-05-19
962,One Day at Disneyland Park - Good but Crowded!,first i had to make myself remember that this was the original disney park having been to walt disney world which is much newer and flashier to temper my expectations overall i spent about day roaming around the park as i only had one day to visit the park as well as the disney adventure park wish signage had been better e g how to get from area to area as well as where to board rides lines were extremely long during my visit and seemed to move much slower than at walt disney world inasmuch as i only had day to visit this translated to me either going on rides or seeing the park i elected to see the park and went on only one ride disappointed overall the team and characters were abundant and very pleasant ,4,2019-05-19
963,fantastic.,just don t like having to spend extra on max pass as a canadian it is already very expensive another american is pushing it beyond the budget ,5,2019-05-18
964,Disney experience with girlfriends,went to disneyland with my girlfriends for a bachelorette party in april we bought park hopper passes with the fast pass and photo package options we were at the park from open to close for days straight we had dinner at two restaurants in the park for which we made advance reservations we were able to ride all the best attractions using the fast pass option via the disney parks app the lines were up to hours for certain rides so i highly recommend getting a fast pass so worth the money to also get the photo pass as we got pictures from the two days with various characters and they all sync to the account so you can see the pictures right away i wouldn t do disney any other way ,5,2019-05-18
965,First Time Ever,coming from fl and being an annual pass holder for disney world i wanted to experience disney land and adventure park we had a blast there are a few rides that are in land that is not in world and restaurants too i absolutely loved disneyland park and will be traveling back to the park later in the year ,5,2019-05-18
966,It truly is the happiest place on earth!!!!,we have season passes and try to go once a month very nice to just walk around and enjoy the ambience everyone is so nice and they really go out of their way to help those with mobility issues the more you go the more you know where to go and how to maneuver around everywhere it s definitely worth the drive and the new parking structure will make it even better their imagineering and organization are incredible ,5,2019-05-18
967,Magical Lines,we were hoping to get there a little early but arrived around am on a wednesday morning and sat in the car park entrance for about minutes once through you go up to a specific level that the traffic wardens allocate and a directed straight into a car park pretty efficient walk to the tram terminal go through the security check point and then wait for the tram to take you to the park entrance tip it was quicker to walk from the car park to downtown disneyland getting into the park isn t too bad but the wait times at each ride and the food stands are a massive let down the energy is pretty good and for the kids it is magical for the adults is magical no one loses their mind standing around the amount of strollers we saw parked to one side was enormous we thought it was a ride itself bring your own food if you can most of the options that are easily accessible after you wait in line are pizzas hot dogs etc so not massively healthy but as expected so no surprises the atmosphere the staff and the entertainment is awesome only let down is that the park unbelievably isn t big enough to have more rides and reduce the wait time average on a good day was minute wait ,4,2019-05-18
968,"4-day park hopper..worth every cent, staff made it the best family holiday",we purchased our tickets in nz and needed id on day one after that they take your photo and it pops up when you go in took us a day to get used to max pass worth every cent photos taken by the crew is fantastic you couldn t help but be happy at disneyland everyone made you feel special it s a really happy place to be the food stands are expensive and found downtown disney a cheaper place to eat fast pass comes with maxpass book rides that go fast radiator springs and hyperspace mountain were the favs swinging option ferris wheel splash mountain and grizzly river run were other favs but hav a poncho because your likely to get wet colour show great but not sure about fastpass option for fantasmic get your walking shoes on because there is a lot of walking we will be back loved our time at disney and it was a very special family holiday don t forget your mickey ears and shirt everyone is a kid when you walk in to the wonderful world of disney we got our disney gear,5,2019-05-17
969,The super max pass,when you buy your expensive ticket add the super max pass that lets you get a fastpass on your phone you can get it anywhere in the park so you don t have to go to the fastpass kiosks it is so worth walking past miles of people in line and board your ride ,5,2019-05-17
970,Magic hour disappointment,i think disneyland is magical and have great memories from visits here as a child we tried to come when it would not be so crowded weekdays in may but i think it is always crowded my main complaint is that we stayed at a disneyland hotel a major expense in order to have magic hour where you enter the park an hour early however it seems that disney is extending magic hour to many people above and beyond hotel guests there were huge lines to enter at am at the front gates by the time we reached fantasyland there was already a minute wait for peter pan a minute wait for toad s adventure and a minute wait for dumbo it makes me reconsider staying at a disney hotel next visit as the benefit of the magic hour was our main reason for spending the extra money ,4,2019-05-17
971,Who doesn't love Disneyland?,disneyland is clean laid out well the staff are friendly the rides seem longer than in florida we had a great time i would come back here again in a second my kids loved it ,5,2019-05-17
972,Vacay,always love this place i can t see how anyone would not enjoy the greatest place on earth so much to do and so little time plus the overall atmosphere is unreal ,5,2019-05-17
973,AMAZING,everything we were told about how awesome this place is is absolutely true this is a must do visit and absolutely spectacular everything is done to perfection the rides are enormous and so much fun the shows are absolutely spectacular and are constantly on i can t talk highly enough of disneyland the magic hour and fastpass is an absolute must to ensure you beat the queues with the best possible chance so much fun,5,2019-05-17
974,Early Spring is a great time to visit.,splash mountain is great on a rainy day no lines the fantasmic light show was very well done we were able to go on many of our favorites multiple times ,5,2019-05-17
975,Dream Come True,this was the best day and more than i could ve hoped for the weather was great and i loved walking around and looking at all the sets which were amazing so much attention and effort has been put in to this even all of the staff are in character all day the parade at pm was my favourite part of the day ,5,2019-05-16
976,Not the pleasant experience as it used to be a few years ago.,i would give this place give stars if i could way too many people long lines and way too expensive several rides had technical difficulties just when it was time for us to use fast pass also fast pass can only be used once every two hours overall a bad experience forget about watching the parade the curb sides are hogged by the annual pass holders who will use towels electric wheel chairs and many such things to reserve the area for others and if you want to stand back and watch the park employees will threaten you that you will be escorted out of the park if you don t move this is after spending dollars on a family trip this was my last visit to disneyland it is not the same delightful experience it used to be several years ago ,1,2019-05-16
977,fun as always,it was very crowded but we had fun anyways couldnt resist to post our funny picture of our daughter and kid that looks boring ,4,2019-05-16
978,Great for Young Families Of All Ages,there is something here for everyone and it was thoroughly enjoyable for our three generation family group entry price is high food is not cheap but reasonable water is very expensive so bring in your own or a refillable water bottle there are lots of water fountains there are more spinning slamming rides and more noise than thirty years ago so take ear plugs and gramma and gramma make sure you leave your hearing aids at home ,4,2019-05-16
979,Disneyland vacation,had a blast the main complaint i have was how many rides things were under reconstruction but we were able to do a ton of things while we were there would do it again ,4,2019-05-16
980,"Overpriced,overcrowded under construction",the magic is how they get so many people to pay the obscene prices for park during the week food is bad and expensive construction everywhere the castle parking structures by frontier and adventure land worlds most expensive construction site to visit the strollers and electric scooters are out of control they should issue a standard sized stroller and ban or severely limit those electric lazy scooters some people think it s nascar on the electric scooter and must have been hit times with strollers that are full of junk as people carry their kid anyway this was on a wednesday weekends must be out of control star wars land is going to be like a war zone with the chaos ,3,2019-05-16
981,Crowded and Getting Worse,my first trip here was in or as a child my wife and i have been here at least once or twice a year for the past years or so every year the crowds and hassle become worse the security lines are long the lines at the turnstiles are long the lines for the rides are long and it is so busy that it is difficult just to walk down main street so why do we continue to subject ourselves to this abuse i suppose part of it is that traditions die slowly but also there is a certain timelessness to the park and having been there so many times we don t really care if we do the rides or not it is fun just to mingle with the crowd and enjoy the children who care little about the congestion and just want to see mickey or minnie or goofy or so will we come back of course however in all honesty i would have to say that if i had small children i would stay away if you have a kid less than about years old the end of the day will likely see a very tired cranky child and equally tired frustrated parents and it will definitely not be the happiest place on earth my suggestion take the thousands of dollars that you will inevitably spend and put it in your child s college fund ,3,2019-05-16
982,Disney vacation.,visited disneyland with granddaughter and her fiance and his little girl had a great experience he proposed to her while there ,5,2019-05-16
983,Say Yes!,thinking of visiting to see what everyone is talking about then do it do your research download the official app and lock in the most memorable family vacation you will ever have i promise you will catch the disney bug there s something for everyone ,5,2019-05-15
984,A Magical Few Days ❤️,had the most magical time at this park knowing that it was the first disneyland park that disney opened himself adds to this we had a day park hopper ticket which we had bought online for and i would highly recommend there was no hassle at the gates they printed off small tickets for us and that was it the park is beautiful despite the iconic castle being under refurbishment the rest of the park manages to make you think you are in the wild west or the jungle however tomorrowland seems a bit neglected which is a shame over the days we were able to do all the rides we wanted which was a good majority of them the most we queued was probably about minutes which i don t think is too bad ride highlights have to be space mountain splash mountain indiana jones haunted mansion and matterhorn bobsleds the parade is fantastic the songs always end up stuck in your head the firework castle show at night was also fab it was great how they projected the images along the buildings of main street usa and not just on to the castle we brought our lunch to the parks which i would recommend as it saves time queuing for food an ice cream sundae was about we would store our bigger bags and food in lockers which could be rented for the day for for a small one which fitted a large rucksack and a few other bits and bobs overall we had the most amazing magical time and i would return ,5,2019-05-15
985,This park is a must durin your visit,we have come and gone for over years and we always enjoy all the rides it s incredible how hey have managed to have the perfect in the best conditions the only thing that we had trouble with id the food there are many good options for healthy or vegan people ,4,2019-05-15
986,To many people,as everywhere in the us there are just to many people for this to be enjoyable plan on long lines and crowds,4,2019-05-15
987,Strollers strollers strollers,i haven t been to disneyland in years as expected it was fairly crowded cast members were great as always two concerns i ve been to this park probably times through the years and the restrooms were always clean they were horrendous on this trip it was really gross i don t know if it was from under staffing but i noticed in all the table areas where you eat the tables weren t cleaned except maybe every hour so i believe they are just not properly staffed the other issue is the unbelievable amount of strollers parked everywhere people are bringing in large strollers packed with blankets food clothing etc stored on these and they just park them and go to other areas of the park to go on rides i saw many families that bring more than one of these large strollers basically avoiding locker rental fees because you can get away with loading up a stroller or two there are places in the park like by the river area that are literally deep in strollers and barely enough room for people to walk by if they want to keep this park an enjoyable experience for all they will need to limit one stroller per family or no strollers and families can rent one stroller that is small in size the stroller parking needs to be monitored if some park there stroller in the same place for longer than minutes staff should be able to move the stroller to an area for pick up later it was really unpleasant to have families with two or three strollers and they re all pushing them together side by side making other people go around them ,3,2019-05-15
988,Expensive but Necessary,you have to visit once in your life this is my third time to anaheim and disneyland it s very dated in disney park i struggle to see what s new in the past years that s why florida hong king paris etc are around i guess usd for a corn dog is simply crazy i saw a lot of families bring their own food and that s sensible rides broke down today and were out of action for serveral hours on the whole it s ok however very tired and really needs a complete overhaul in my view,3,2019-05-14
989,You better bring a FAT wallet,what can you say about disneyland greatest theme park on earth everything disney is first class it takes money to keep it clean secure and functional so you need to understand when you ticket prices of per day per adult i did not want to go with my family for my wife s birthday but i did hours to find a parking spot where i got the privilege of paying to park we arrived on the disneyland property around am and we did not get on a ride until i was furious and felt ripped off by the time the park closed we were able to go on rides total a small bag of popcorn while waiting in line was worse than at the movies just bring a lot of cash and let go ,5,2019-05-14
990,Magical,what an incredible place so much to see and do and so many experiences to have we were a little taken aback by the crowds especially as given this is supposed to be during a quieter period however we used magic hour as well as maxpass fastpass to maximise rides and minimize waiting the fantasmic show was a standout i can t believe they do that show every night pure magic ,5,2019-05-14
991,family vacation,this was a great experience for all the family but it is really expensive to eat there for water come on ,5,2019-05-14
992,Love Disney,live disney and always will found the main park to be extremely busy and really long wait times although still had a great time found the adventure park to actually be more fun than the main park the cars ride is the best and just exceptional sadly splash mountain was closed when we were there which i was really sad about,5,2019-05-13
993,mostly standing in lines,disneyland is fantastic but i want to point out some observations from our last trip last week it was supposed to be a really low crowd time mid week and before the big star wars opening later in the month but the crowds were pretty shocking to me it was not unusual for many of the attractions to have wait times of an hour or even two hours i educated myself extensively before the trip so that i would understand about fastpasses and the maxpass thing we took full advantage but the basic problem is that there are so many people there who want to do the popular rides something s gotta give even with a fastpass you may have to wait minutes or more for a ride while the standby people are waiting much longer other times the wait was minimal and i kind of felt bad for the other people i was passing up just because they didn t understand how to work the system as well as i did one problem we encountered several times was that the maxpass app would tell us that fastpasses were available for a particular time so we cancelled a different fastpass so we could replace it with a different ride or different time that would work better for us but then after we chose the new option they said it was no longer available so now we lost out on the previous pass we had which was no longer available either we completely missed out on one attraction because of that i think they need to fix that so that the pass is reserved for you for a few minutes so you can complete your change before you lose it so everybody says do all the rides you can as early in the day as possible the peter pan ride has no fastpass and it s very popular so my plan was to use our magic morning day and bolt to peter pan so we wouldn t have to endure an hour line for it the magic morning is supposed to let you in hour before the general opening in this case at am we got there early and were inside the park at there were already a zillion people there and the wait for peter pan was already minutes why don t they do what they say they will do and open the park at am so much for my peter pan plan if you can use it the mobile order is a great thing super fast by the end of our visit at disneyland i really wished i could pay twice as much to visit on a day with only half the guests there i also started thinking that the fastpass maxpass and mobile dining strategies just don t really seem fair why should i get to go to the front of the line or at least pass up a whole bunch of other people just because i understand how to work the system better than they do shouldn t everybody just have to wait the same amount of time ,4,2019-05-13
994,We loved it!,we just love this park and the app with the optional max pass which includes the rides photos is awesome we used it all the time this grandma will definitely be back ,5,2019-05-13
995,2 great park,disney california adventure great park great rides small enough to do in the morning which we did then headed over to disneyland park a lot of walking and rides until we stayed to watch mickey mix souncheck which was pretty amazing would do it all again,5,2019-05-13
996,Great fun but SUPER long waits,we decided to go during the week before school was out even though there were still tons of people it wasn t as many as during the busy summertime i love the fact that they re open until midnight simply to try and see everything since we only had one day dedicated to go to disneyland we tried to get there at the opening time and stay until closing our feet were exhausted but it was worth it i definitely wish there were either stools or chairs in line to sit on or some way to break up standing in line for hours though great place for a family trip ,5,2019-05-13
997,Making memories that will last a lifetime.,amazing something for everyone beautiful gardens lots of fun rides for all ages lots of shops restaurants nightly fireworks and mikey s mixed magic extravaganza loved the mark twain river boat paddle wheeler too many wonderful things to list ,5,2019-05-13
998,"Too long for ""big rides""",a minute posted wait time shouldn t mean hours smaller rides were less but accuracy withing minutes or so should be there too many fast passes are given out for the times and stand by riders shouldn t be ignored in favor totally to the fast pass line ,4,2019-05-12
999,Land of happiness,so amazing so many cool areas and rides everything is built with such care and attention to detail perfect for everyone as there are so many different themes all over the parks the wifi was pretty terrible so it was difficult to use the app properly lots of people but crowds managed pretty well ,5,2019-05-12
1000,Home,it s always smiles the staff are always friendly may seems a great time try to do a weekday less cues also get the app and maxi passes take advantage of staying at one of the disney hotels or sister hotels and get extra magical hour it s so worth it a must is the train ride ,5,2019-05-11
1001,How can you not love Disneyland?,it s classic it s amazing it just didn t have a castle which is a real bummer and also a lot of rides kept breaking down but overall it was really magical very clean and i can t wait to visit again ,5,2019-05-11
1002,So many people,i know its a very popular place but why not limit the number of tickets sold the crowds and lines make for a less positive experience we went in a off time but i felt it was still to crowded the waiting is the worst part even with the maxpass i am glad we got them though ,4,2019-05-11
1003,Disneyland,wonderful so clean organised and happy thousands of folk there pn the day so spent more time waiting than riding goes with the territory rest rooms amazingly clean people very respectful of hygiene and not one piece of litter anywhere ,5,2019-05-11
1004,Very disappointed,i went with my family all of us for the first time i have a and month old baby i was very disappointed to not see characters walking as advertised on tv i was also very upset when my year old went to storm trooper to ask for his book to be autographed and a picture taken and was denied this magical dream he had storm trooper raised his arm along with his weapon not sure what they call it and walked off he made my son feel so little and made him cry who does this i wouldn t be upset if he politely said i will but right now i can t i dont care say something don t walk away that was the worst thing i have seen happen i can t even believe how they are working there that really ruined and messed with my son emotions he doesn t even know what to think of storm trooper i had to take the time to explain to my son he did nothing wrong because he didn t he was excited to see his favorite character and was made feel like he did the worst thing in this world to approach his hero smh ,1,2019-05-11
1005,Family Celebration!,we enjoyed all the sights sounds of disneyland with our family while we celebrated the engagement of our nephew such a great place to hang with the family and downtown disney has some great food ,5,2019-05-10
1006,Visiting fun land!,kids are the perfect excuse to visit this wonderful place even or kids are young we where able to enjoy with them for us as adults we were able to go back un time and remember or favorite characters we are coming back for sure ,5,2019-05-10
1007,Truly the happiest place on earth!,i just love how happy and friendly all the staff is there i transform into a kid everytime i enter the gates ,5,2019-05-10
1008,HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH,this is a very busy place so if you can go late night it is the best time to not have to stand in line for what seems like an eternity blue bayou is the place to eat if you can get in reservations are highly recommended ,5,2019-05-10
1009,Excellent Park,my visit to disneyland was excellent this is my second time visiting disneyland i love the characters food and stores i enjoyed the cars ride i hope i ll be back soon ,5,2019-05-10
1010,Truly the Happiest Place On Earth (when you don't have to wait in lines!),first of all i would avoid hitting the parks on a saturday unless you want to wait in lines that average hours we were just here and got frustrated by the length of so many of the lines the prime time for attendance seems to be from a p in disneyland park itself i would strongly urge you to download their official park app which indicates the length of lines at each of the rides and shows quite helpful when navigating around if you can handle the extra cost of an already ridiculously priced ticket i understand that maxpass allows for online securing of fastpasses if you can find a time to hit the park during an off peak period its well worth the joy that the theme park instills ,5,2019-05-09
1011,how to walk the park so u dont dack track,first as u walk through the park turn left keep going in this direction till u go allaround the and end up back at the enterance then go straight up the middle i found this to work out just fine for or day passes,5,2019-05-09
1012,Fun times with long lines,we had a family trip to enjoy disneyland and california adventure park was a fun time but we were all caught off guard by the long wait times at a time that was supposed to be a slow time kids were frustrated by the min hour lines ,4,2019-05-09
1013,Daughters Birthday Surprise,my daughter was celebrating her birthday on may the th and i surprised her with a visit to disneyland for her birthday my daughter is and she has special needs and to say she was excited is an understatement we purchased our ticket for the park through the hotel and we had a most amazing celebration we spent two days in disneyland and days in california adventure park one the first day there it was my daughter s actual birthday we both received pins saying it was her birthday and every staff member that we came into contact with wished her a happy birthday at the end of the first day my daughter and i both were made honorary citizens of disneyland this thrilled both of us and we just loved the joy and the experience of attending on her birthday everyone treated us with joy and kindness we purchased the max pass so that allowed us to use a fastpass for the rides as well as download all of the pictures that we had taken with the disney characters although the lineup were long we enjoyed visiting with people and played games while we were in line well done disney a trip to remember,5,2019-05-09
1014,Best Amusement Park!,i ve been visiting disneyland since before i was in grade school the memories i ve made here will last me a lifetime so glad i m able to share this with my family best park in the us better than six flags fiesta texas etc my husband is not a traveler and definitely not a theme park goer but disney is different for him and he always suggest coming back here they are in the process of updating everything with the new star wars and marvel parks it s a bit congested right now due to all the construction but once it s complete it s going to be fantastic love all the upgrades please bring people movers back this was one of my favorite rides as a kid ,5,2019-05-09
1015,Magical,how could disney be any less than magical tons and tons of rides and fun things to do i would go back again and again if i lived close everyone who is a child or a child at heart should make it a point to attend some day,5,2019-05-09
1016,Hated it,went on family holiday to usa from australia and thought we would tick disneyland off our bucket list as a family we hated it it was so over crowded and really did not suit our teenage kids i was told it was a fantasy world well my idea of a fantasy is not over crowding long waits for rides over hr and more and micky mouse ears would suit year olds but i must admit there were so many americans that looked so happy with the place i couldnt understand it but california adventure park was great as long as you pay the extra money for the max pass,2,2019-05-08
1017,StarWars,goodprice empty lines vip treatment food is good mickey is funny looking wont go back because is not free for all,5,2019-05-08
1018,Stroller Nightmares,love disneyland which can be the happiest place in the world except for the the thousands of strollers clogging the streets and sidewalks the other big issue is the adults pushing the strollers they cut you off they often just stop which blocks the pedestrians and some just plow ahead regardless of available space slows everything down and can be frustrating the park is always crowded even when schools are still in session don t go there in the summer the upsides are numerous great rides fantastic entertainment very friendly and polite cast members and great food in some select restaurants try wine country trattoria on the california side for outstanding italian food and a wonderful wine list blue bayou on the disney side is excellent as well grit your teeth and deal with the crowds and strollers and you should have a good albeit tiring experience ,4,2019-05-08
1019,How can you not love Disney?,disneyland is great it s disney however it was so crowded and it took forever to get onto the rides you just have to expect that if you go in the summer my recommendation is to either go in the evenings when it s cooler and when most of the families have gone if you don t have kids or to go to disney world which is bigger and has a lot more things to do but hey it s disney how can you not love disney ,4,2019-05-08
1020,Quintessential but Crowded and Costly,plan your trip well either early in the day or late in the day is the only way to do disney otherwise it is a problem with getting on rides even in the off season can t knock it tho as where else do you see the marvelous mind of walt ,5,2019-05-07
1021,Average Average,facility is showing its age and has not changed busy busy and busy look to discounted tickets as at full price you will be very upset ,3,2019-05-07
1022,Had to work to have fun.,took our grandson for his th birthday his first visit so he had a great time but i agree with many others that is is getting to be overcrowded and makes the experience seem like work to get around and get on the rides ,3,2019-05-07
1023,A Must Do!,i am a veteran walt disney world visitor who had the chance to visit disneyland in july during a conference i attended in anaheim visiting disneyland was on my must do bucket list for some time it did not disappoint there are a number of attractions that are not available at wdw so make sure to take those in i did find that the food available at disneyland was better in my opinion that that offered at wdw would definitely recommend that everyone visit at least once in their lifetime ,5,2019-05-07
1024,Wow this is the happiest place on earth,disneyland is the happiest place on earth for young and old from rides for the little ones fast jolting roller coaster style rides for the adventurous and the many spectacular stage shows disneyland is definitely worth the years of planning and money i totally recommend getting the day pass before leaving australia disneyland are huge days and nights with this ticket you can take your time and break up the days by adding day trips and shopping whilst still exploring the park at night the fireworks and laser shows are must see just a hint the ride lines are much quicker when the fireworks and shows are on use the fastpass option where you can this is a must do adventure at least once in everyone s life,5,2019-05-07
1025,Awful,we had a one day hopper park as we only had one day to visit well worthh it we went to both park from when it openend till it closed really enjoyable and amazing fireworks mickey show at the end went home to bed very tire,1,2019-05-07
1026,fantastic day out at both parks,very pretty place to visit the shows from the parade doing the day and night atmosphere was great a little hot please get lots of water to drink and the park is big enough to accommodate the large crowd if you are thinking about visiting do it it s well worth it ,5,2019-05-07
1027,Family vacation,the park was overcrowded when it was supposed to be a slow time we found out from talking to security that a lot of people were visiting to use their annual passes before block out dates start it was wall to wall people making it impossible to walk at times and people using phones stopping in the middle of traffic looking at their phones doesn t help either you can tell the park is overcrowded when you have to wait minutes for a small world or minutes for the haunted mansion the park needs vast improvement when it comes to the fastpass system they use in california as a guest of the disney resort hotels you should be guaranteed a minimum of fastpasses per person per day like in florida but they make you pay extra for their maxpass instead to get guaranteed passes if i m already paying at the resort why should i have to pay more to get a guarantee that florida gives you included in your stay or you can try to get a fastpass the old fashioned way of running to the attraction as soon as possible to try to get a pass which for some rides is impossible fastpasses go very quickly if the system is working the last day we were there the fastpass system kept going down all day so you couldn t get any paper ones and i would hate to be someone who paid if it s this bad now i hate to see what happens when star wars opens in the days we spent in the park we got on almost all the rides only once the staff for the most part that we encountered were friendly and sometimes helpful when you needed a question answered they are lacking in help though because a lot of the snack carts were closed during the week and only sometimes open on the weekends there are plenty of shops to visit if you are a shopper but a lot of the merchandise is the same throughout the park soda and water are expensive in the park so if you can bring your own it will save you money as of may a bottle of soda is and water is they parks are definitely not managed as well as the ones in florida i would probably go back in the future sometime but not for at least or more years i ll stick to florida instead ,5,2019-05-07
1028,Overcrowded and No Longer Magical,i went to disneyland for my birthday it was alot like the location in florida but a bit smaller we went in october which in florida is a slower time of year however this location was not i highly recommend spending the extra money to fast pass the rides or you will never be able to get on most of them as the wait was well over and hour or more for most ,2,2019-05-06
1029,Definitely a fun place !,we had the most amazing time the days we were there we went to both parks disneyland and disney california adventures the staff here is amazing everyone was so happy and friendly parking was per day the first day we were able to park in the mickey and friends garage and the trams took us to the parks the last day we had to drive to the toy story lot and use the toy story buses to get to the parks the lines to load the buses were so long but moved fast get there before the mickey and friends garage is full to prevent this everyone at disney must drink happy juice i love the special attention given to my son because it was his birthday everyone celebrated him for free lol,4,2019-05-06
1030,Happiest Place on Earth, people a day in first week of may crammed like sardines everywhere nothing but a money grab had to buy maxx pass for our phone at pp pd just to get a fast pass and find out which rides had lines less than an hour long disney can move more people than the stockyards can move cattle and they re very good at it but even so it s not fun with that many people crowded shoulder to shoulder in such a small place and it s dangerous one disaster and there would be mass trampling couldn t get restaurant reservations couldn t get seating wait lines long for snacks beverages everything nothing anywhere was less than a minute wait even the rest rooms entrance was lined up out and down harbour boulevard just to get in don t take a bag or fanny pack and you can bypass up the middle a little faster strollers the size of mini cars everywhere impossible to get around kids fussing due to long waits who could blame them wait an hour for a three minute ride it s no longer the dream park of our memory very disappointed in you disney you re better than this bring back the real disney experience you don t need to make so much money on the backs of families and children i m sad to say we will not be back if this is how you run your business ,5,2019-05-06
1031,No longer the happiest place on earth.,firstly this disneyland park needs a revamp asap the main disney castle was under renovation and there were curtains all over it with a picture of the castle instead many sections were either closed or not open for whatever reason we don t know the park itself i think is highly over rated i have been to other disneyland parks and if i compare to the one in hong kong then anaheim la one does not stand anywhere near from the main entrance to the last ride it was total chaos we bought fastpass maxpass from the disney app when we were inside the park its a total joke it comes with so many restrictions like its available only for select rides and that one cannot request another pass until an hour in fact in many popular rides like space mountain the queues for fastpass were as long as general and to control that they simply stop the lines of general entry even if you can generate a fastpass the time slots are for hours ahead when you could easily wait and get a ride entering a general queue on top of that there is a frequent error in generating pass from the app and have to retry a number of times we made use of fastpass in rides only and felt cheated with the way this entire fastpass program exists the rides were good especially the space mountain splash mountain mountain railroad indiana jones matterhorn some of the shows were also great the food was priced super high and there were only few options for hot food ,2,2019-05-06
1032,FastPass/MaxPass is a Joke!! I paid to stand in queue!,we had a great day trip to disneyland last week except for the high crowd levels it was hard to even move in the walkways our kids had a blast and the parks are beautiful again if the crowds were better under control maxpass def helps with wait times but disney needs to figure out a better way to control crowd levels i second another reviewer that disney could have had rides working at full capacity and employ more cast members and pay them higher wages to ensure a better customer experience they have the money so not sure why they aren t doing more to ensure guests are having the best experience possible still an amazing place to visit ,3,2019-05-05
1033,What can I say!,my th personal visit and the most crowded so crowded each ride between mins and an hour wait and wait we did all the good things still exist but changes are continually happening the tiki room is still a favourite just magic we missed the new star wars land by a week darn all in all disney land should be on everyones bucket list at least once ,5,2019-05-04
1034,Wonderful Wonderful,having first visited disneyland with our children in and later on our grandchildren our many visits would be in total around times and our most recent visit last week for days in disneyland park and days in california aventure with the youngest of our grandchildren i feel quite experienced to make critical comments the parks are as good as ever but the wait times over the years have increased to a point where we lost a full day adding up the hours we waited in line during our visit having travelled across the world to show our little ones the happiest place on earth it became rather testing at some stages last week we did invest in the maxi pass but even then on some rides we had a minute wait prior to our visit to anaheim we spent days at universal studios who have a fast pass far superior and operates far more efficiently than the disney max pass which can only be accessed by an app on your phone bearing in mind the efforts now needed to visit the parks we all had a wonderful time and once again being a part of it all ,4,2019-05-04
1035,Vacation,happiest place on earth max fast pass is a really good idea lots to see and do parades were fun and the fireworks spectacular mmmm dole whip is so yummy,5,2019-05-04
1036,Pushing the Price Limits,i have been a huge fan of disneyland since i was a kid i now feel that disney is increasingly gouging their loyal customers by way of example a monte cristo sandwich in the blue bayou for a lousy sandwich a simple balloon for our toddler i am so tired of paying hundreds of dollars to stand in line all day ,2,2019-05-04
1037,If you dream of standing in lines then this is your dream come true.,recently roy disney s wife shared her concern that corporate disney is not sharing its profits with the employees in light of the box office hits that just set records i would agree i m so disappointed with the disney experience minute wait times to see most attractions during the so called off season time yes it is a place of wonder for kids and even adults but standing back and reflecting on the bigger picture i became rather bitter for example auto topia had a wait time of one hour but the park would not open up three more lanes of cars to cut down on the wait time standing in line is an expectation unless you pay for the privilege of not waiting and guess what you wait in line to buy that privilege too to get into the park you must wait in huge lines to pass security it wouldn t cost much to make that process more efficient then you wait in huge lines to get your ticket even when you ve purchased in advance online an investment in higher employee wages efficiency and customer service would be so beneficial a message to the world that would hark back to walt s original vision ,1,2019-05-03
1038,Time with Granddaughter,we had a great time at the park with our grand daughter check out the parade and later the fireworks everyone was nice and very clean dont pass thi up ,5,2019-05-03
1039,Still have piped music in my brain,just as you d expect disneyland is amazing plastic super fun frustrating memorable in so many ways even with the castle under scaffolding the disney magic was on display and it was a special time for our family we stayed in a park hotel which gave us access to the magic hour am which in turn enabled us to smash out space mountain rides before the hordes arrived recommended and once we got our heads around the complicated fast pass system we really enjoyed ourselves over days we walked a full marathon each amazed to see some people in high heels recommendations this is not a place to just turn up at and do you need to prepare your plan beforehand and make bookings for shows literally as you walk through the gates it is astoundingly busy so you have to be strategic if you want to make the most of your time in the magic kingdom if you do you ll have a great time just be ready to be humming disney tunes for days afterwards ,5,2019-05-03
1040,Who Doesn't Love Disneyland,if i could find one place on earth that brings happiness to just about everyone who visits it it would be disneyland this is the perfect place with great people working there we as a family loved it ,5,2019-05-02
1041,Sweet 🖋❤️Disneyland,what a place disneyland great place to check out with your wife husband couples an kids friends many great memories disneyland what a fun place to check out check it out west coast los angeles ,5,2019-05-02
1042,Awesome Picks from Daisy 6,my sisters and nephews went there last april early monday if you leave within anaheim or nearby area it is best to go there early to avoid heavy traffic we parked at nd level number yeah that s why it s daisy they allow bottled water and food inside small bottles and flasks for water and small food package for food we brought cheese rolls from portos am not sure if they allow other types of drinks we did not take the fast pass ticket so we patiently waited on the stand by lane waiting time is indicated on each area s entrance thus enabling one to organize the day s activities we were able to take matterhorn bobled super worth the wait man in the splash mountain ride i removed my shoes and placed them in my bag haha i came out dry while the others were soaked we didnt buy raincoats there however got a huge splash from the pirates of the carribean ride hahaha if you did not bring extra clothes you can buy a change of clothes there but if the budget is a consideration you may use the hand dryers found in restrooms i saw several kids and teens trying to dry their leggings and hair while waiting in the big thunder mountain railroad i noticed a couple of coca cola cups by the stream i just hope guests will be sensible enough to use the rubbish bins that are located all over the park we immensely enjoyed the cave mazes and barrell bridge on pirates lair on sawyer s island quite chilly on mark twain river boat have to bring your jacket we stayed on the rd level view was spectacular disneyland railroad twice this served as leisure plus rest time there are available tables and seats for those who wish to eat but we just ate while queuing for the rides we were able to take pictures with minnie mouse but her house was closed that time huhu goofy mickey mouse amazing items in his house eeyore and tigger in the garden i love tigger s bright orange and black colors eeyore was fun surprisingly haha for one day we were also able to see underwater in the submarine voyage amazing sights if your child is not much into scary stuff do not go to the haunted mansion kids were crying it was great to see the parking for walkers strollers min before faireworks make sure you find a good spot along main street they place guide ropes and vacated some areas make sure you do not get lost in the crowd several people were smoking by the entrance ticket area ,5,2019-05-02
1043,Still magical,this place has always been and forever will be special the feeling you get entering the park seeing the characters and different attractions is just priceless this is definitely a dream trip for all ages especially young kids spend the money and go to disneyland you will not regret it,5,2019-05-01
1044,So much fun for all ages,a great day of simple fun and thrills bring cash nothing is cheap but we knew that it s disney but they are great letting you bring in your own food drinks etc but read the list closely we list several items at the entry gates selfy sticks glass refill bottles etc it is worth buying the photo pass and fastpass have fun ,5,2019-05-01
1045,Great place,all and all a great day was had the crowds are huge and ride times sometimes up to a min wait but worth it very disappointed the castle was under repair and covered but we understood if you want to take a short cut on the rides grab a max pass for each it allows you to book a time every mins and believe me it s a great feeling floating past the ques ,4,2019-05-01
1046,Great family time,we spent days at disneyland and days at california adventure park it was great but tiring kids loved it we loved the bigger rides at adventure park better especially guardians of the galaxy ride and incredicoaster lots of good options and heaps of souvenir shops ,5,2019-05-01
1047,"A Compact Version of Disney World, but Still Great",having been to the florida location numerous times over the years i didn t know how this one would compare the much smaller footprint made it quicker easier to get from ride to ride the cinderella s castle was much much smaller but also being renovated many of the rides were identical while some were notably different the indiana jones ride which fl does not have was awesome space mountain was much more puke worthy it s a small world was way more beautiful from the exterior they had several of the old rides that fl doesn t have like pinocchio and mr toad i love how their fast passes worked it was easy to use and we were able to use them back to back on rides fast passing almost everything we wanted to ride we went the first week of april and while crowded i didn t think it was too bad we were only in the park for like hours and i do wish i d had about more hours to do everything ,5,2019-04-30
1048,"4 Days, LOVED them all!",had the day pass spent at dl and one at ca great place to visit we will be back saw a lot in those days but there is more that we missed and more we want to see again ,5,2019-04-30
1049,Horrible experience unless you like paying USD 500 / day for standing line...,disneyland park is totally overrated we went on a rainy monday so there should ve been less than normal lines the different lines we stood in parking lot line line to enter the park area line to enter the monorail line to enter attractions line to receive fasttrack in order to cut in line while other people jump in line without fasttrack line to toilet line to buy food line to pay for your souvenirs line to get out the park line to take shuttle bus to parking lot yards at night time totals up to for eating attractions hours of standing in line never again ,1,2019-04-30
1050,Fun unforgettable,oh my god you can really forget your self and enjoy everything you face there its a huge word of fun,5,2019-04-30
1051,It was a blast!,we were so sad that the castle was under refurbishment but we didn t let it ruin our good time i purchased the maxpass before we went and it was super easy to use and very convenient maxpass includes free pictures taken by disney photographers i have been to disney world and there is no shortage of photographers this was not the case here they definitely need to add more we were able to do all of the rides that we wanted to do and we got the snacks that we wanted to try we spent two days here and on the last day we watched the fireworks show it was amazing all of the workers were polite and helpful ,5,2019-04-29
1052,Best Weekend,the lines were quick the park was always clean the food was amazing and everyone had a smile we were without children and had so much fun ,5,2019-04-29
1053,You need lot of time & patience,took my son to the park on a weekend fri sun very busy all over the places my son enjoyed it but he was very sad that he could not try a lot of attractions as the wait time was huge ranging from minutes if you have a lot of time to waste waiting in the line for the attractions fastpass system at the park is just a ripoff you can have only one attraction added to your plan at any point once you complete that attraction you can add one more ,3,2019-04-29
1054,Still the best amusement park but EXPENSIVE,there s nothing like disneyland and it should be on your bucket list if you ve never been park is well maintained and parking is ok but not cheap at tickets can cost up to per adult years old and up during peak periods food is not cheap either if you take a family without a season s pass you could easily spend hundreds of dollars just on admission tickets if you go frequently get a disney credit card to get free park perks and park promotions downtown disney is also a fun place to visit ,5,2019-04-29
1055,I Love Disneyland!,i think it s because going to disneyland is one of my earliest memories but i just love visiting the park every few years you won t find a place with friendlier more helpful staff and the entire park is so clean yes it s expensive for many and there are crowds but you can adjust the timing of your visit for fewer crowds and you can visit on a budget if you plan ahead it s such a special place for so many people and kids enjoy themselves too there are loads of online resources on how to visit on a budget such as staying at an offsite hotel and bringing your own snacks and meals i highly recommend that everyone try it once but be warned it s highly addictive ,5,2019-04-29
1056,The Magic never gets old,i ve been going to disneyland since the early s and the magic never gets old this was my th visit this year we have developed a strategy that works best for us we stay at a disney resort and you can get in at we can actually get on about rides in less than hours as the day goes on the crowds thicken and wait times are over an hour making it difficult to experience everything max pass is worth the extra by nightfall the crowds can be overwhelming so early is better ,5,2019-04-28
1057,It is the happiest place on earth …. It's what you make of it,ok this trip has been a long time in the making and we were going to ensure we made the most of it we went there knowing that it is crowed and the lines are long but out of the days we actually hit the jack pot and waited no longer than minutes for the rides you need to plan ahead down load the app and see where to go for each ride to get the most out of your day we waited no longer than mins for each ride as we planned where to go i personally think the fast pass is a waste of time i also paid dollars nz for passes for day of us travelled and what a complete waste of money very disappointed when we booked the tickets they were hours away like booked maxpass at am and got the booking for between pm the only advantage of max pass is for the photo opportunities so basically i wasted my hard earned money we had a day park hopper and visited and rode on everything during this time all the lands of disneyland are worth visiting but the must see is the fireworks mickeys dance party in the evening it is amazing just wow we also watched the parades something that make us all feel like kids again one thing though when watching shows like fantasmic remember the little ones there is limited space unless you get the fastpass for better viewing i don t agree with this i think it should all be open and all the unoccupied space used people big adults pushed and shoved and blocked views my family adults teenagers had front viewing we also let the little ones behind us come in front as they would not block our view yet we blocked theirs remember people it s a happy place be kind of the staff are very happy indeed and nothing was ever a problem again yes some have to get grumpy but when managing something of this size firm voices need to be used for crowd control food is as to be expected fast and convenient and expensive but if you want better options go out to the disney district still expensive but better dining options too many people on those ride on scooters i know some genuine people who really need it but there are a lot of out and out lazy buggers who in fact should walk these are a hazard to many to fast bumping into the able walkers summary you are never to old to enjoy this place go with an open mind a positive attitude and enjoy being a child again ,5,2019-04-28
1058,never looses the magic,the last time i was here the area disney s california adventure now occupies was the parking lot it was magical then and through the years and changes the magic remains this was the first visit for my wife and daughters and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves i could go every year and never get tired of it i understand why some people opt to get annual passes to guard against disappointments research research research i cannot stress that enough if there is an attraction that you have your heart set on experiencing check multiple sources to see if it is undergoing a refurbishment and what the timeline for said refurbishment could be i knew castle would be encased in scaffolding and would not be visible during our visit however it did not detract from our experience if you have friends and or family members who recently went hit them up for advice and learn from their experiences another thing expect crowds regardless of what time of year it is granted some times of the year can be busier than others we were fortunate that the time we were here crowds were not overwhelming fastpass return times were reasonable and we didn t have to wait too long on the rides where everyone rides standby use the app it will really really help you seeing standby times and fastpass return times can help you adjust your plan to how things are at the moment or help you decide what to do next it will also help you locate where specific characters are and when they will be there lastly i highly recommend seeing mickey s soundsatonal parade from start to finish i also highly recommend seeing both night shows fantasmic mickey s mix magic if you want to catch the earlier fantasmic show you should probably go get your fastpasses for it right after rope drop as the earlier show will likely go fast by the time i went to get our passes only the later showing was available ,5,2019-04-28
1059,Happiest Place On Earth is not what I would call it,this is going to be a lengthy review only because this trip had been planned for over a year let s start with the lines now myself and others had planned this trip for over a year we went easter long weekend and we already were fully expecting it to be busy we had a day park hopper pass to be able to get on everything and enjoy both parks fully the friday and sunday were the least busiest days and the most enjoyable but there are lines for everything lines to get your bags checked lines to get in sometimes lines well past the monorail and took minutes or more and lines for rides of up too minutes or more these parks are so packed full its impossible to move around fast pass is a joke unless you get to them early got a fast pass at am and was to come back at use it at pm the rides with the days we did manage to get on everything at least twice but more often then not indiana jones was broken space mountain went down a few times splash mountain went down big thunder mountain incredibles coaster pretty much everything was broken at one time or another waited in line for minutes for cars before being given a fast pass and told it was broke at about pm it never did reopen that night if you only have a day pass or hell even days the wait times and the amount of broken down rides would make it near impossible to get on everything food maybe i am picky but my friends agreed it was near impossible to find anything decent here the red rose tavern wasn t bad but it was fast food and it wasn t exactly cheap or anything to rave about odered a burger and it was ready before i was done paying the grey stuff was pretty delicious though i can t understand why the bengal barbeque has such great reviews it cost me for a chicken skewer that has little pieces of chicken on it we did the dinner and fantasmic tickets with the hungry bear resturant and what a joke you got a piece of chicken and or salmon rice with cranberries and peaches in it yuck and a arugula salad with chick peas it came in a plastic container like something from a cafeteria the blue bayou was the only place in disney that was absolutely blow your mind fantastic it is not cheap however it was a splurge dinner the best food we food was outside the park better food and prices ot is nice they let you bring in water and food now since a water bottle cost the churro stands were really good and so was the popcorn stands the wine country trattoria in california adventure was very good amazing pasta and wine pairings and we did the world of color package and we got excellent seats for a person the shows fantatsmic and world of color are incredible and must watch while your here get there early to get good seats and don t be suckered into the dinner and show packages for fantasmic the one through hungry bear was a massive disappointment the food was terrible and we were told to get there by pm but they had already started seating people way before that we were sat on the side and were obstructed by lamp post and a gate we saw fantatsmic the second night and went early stood on the bridge and it as a primo spot the world of color we did the dinner and show through the wine country trattoria and there the food was fantastic and the seats were right up front that was a package and that was worth it overall i ve learned a lot from this experience i would love to come back but may better select our dates from reading other reviews though sounds like they over pack these parks no matter the time of year for how much you pay the wait times and food are just not worth is eat outside the park get fast passes when you can hope lady luck is on your side and the rides aren t all broken down for how much money they must make the rides are always broken it was fun made some great memories i guess i just expected more but if felt like a money grab everywhere you turned ,3,2019-04-27
1060,Overpriced and Overrated,it is no doubt a legendary place but i just dont think it s worth the money and headache of overcrowding and overpriced everything disney continues to raise the price of admission and the crowds are ridiculous every single day there are plenty of things to do in socal that are cheap or free save your family hundreds of dollars and go somewhere else ,2,2019-04-27
1061,Fun but really crowded,i always love to go to disney land the kids have a blast as well as adults downside is that it s to crowded not alot of room,5,2019-04-27
1062,BEWARE -- arbitrary security checks and application of fictitious rules?,the thing that motivated me to write this review is that i was stopped at the security check to the disneyland california site for the first time in my several disneyland disney world trips the security lady there said that i m not allowed to bring a lock to the park and she ll either confiscate it or i ve to bring it back whence it came from i was shocked i just walked min from the hotel to the park and now i ve to walk back minutes in order to be allowed into the park the lock was a tiny tsa lock that i always keep on my backpack it poses no security whatsoever i was never stopped at any of their parks prior to this because i was going to bring a tripod and i kind of know what i m allowed or not to bring i even checked several websites including the official disneyland site before travelling to be sure i don t bring things that disney won t allow i didn t remember seeing mentions of locks and i checked again on the night of the incident and still don t find any mention of locks i asked the security lady what the reason was behind the ban but she could not give a valid reason only saying those are the disney rules after trying to reason with her we saw there was no use i asked if they have a locker so that i can put my lock inside no was the answer i need to get past the security to get to the lockers we already had plans with the family but if we can only carry through our plan if we d have to give up the lock however we didn t think it fair that we should sacrifice our property for this so called rule we re frustrated as going back and forth would take a while and it ruins our plan finally after discussing with the family i decided to run back to the hotel to drop off the lock fortunately i m still fit but i could have gotten a heart attack from the running now that i checked the official disney site again and saw no mention of locks i m wondering if this isn t some kind of racial profiling by that particular guard who somehow came up with something to make life difficult for us as we are a member of visible minority my whole experience with they disney parks would have been good but we felt sad by the incident the memory is tainted by this unhappy experience disney i feel sorry that you have such heartless employee i still give out of because the rest of cast members are quite polite and act kindly ,2,2019-04-27
1063,So fun on Easter Day!,who knew easter day is light no line was more than minutes wait and that was the popular rides great day definitely hit indiana jones thunder mtn the matterhorn ,5,2019-04-27
1064,Miserable employees,may be my review is biased on the fact that i am a disney fan and this was my dream destination i mean not exactly this but disneyland paris i would request you to take the full ticket that also has the provision of taking photos this gives us a full day access to all rides though it is costly the experience is worth every penny spent at the entry even the guards ticket seller are cheerful with a smile always once you get the tickets you have to stand in a queue throgh which you will be transferred to the main disneyland through buses all the sections if disneyland are worth watching but the most important and a must see is the fireworks in the evening it is mesmerizing make sure you get the right seat so as to get the best view also few more must see are the parade the water show the band in front of the castle big thunder mountain road jungle cruise and space mountain be sure to be there till in the midnight it is a wonderful feeling ,1,2019-04-26
1065,Dream come true!,always a magical experience even when you are older i would recommend this place to everyone it s magical ,5,2019-04-25
1066,Our Easter before the crowds,last time i was there was for grad night in my wife won disney tickets for so we took our youngest granddaughter many of the sights i remember and haven t changes a whole lot the experience was great and i thought the afternoon parade was outstanding definitely will not be waiting another years before returning ,5,2019-04-24
1067,Disneyland 40 years later.,honestly if you are reading this review then you are seeking different tips for the disneyland park experience once you decide to visit there is no turning back every person should have at least one experience with mickey minnie and their entourage hack prepay your ticket park at downtown disney parking rate is the same at the park every minute counts and waiting to park then catch the tram is wasted minutes board the monorail located in downtown disney and you will be delivered in tomorrowland near space mountain that s right you skip all entry lines your pre purchased ticket is entry at the monorail boarding station if you desire to take pictures at the entry of disneyland then this is not a hack for you hack the disneyland railroad east of the monorail deboarding station takes you around the entire park and different entry points of the various lands the train ride is fun it is an actual attraction and you see much of the park and boarding at tomorrowland is less crowded than the other points i highly recommended that you complete the full tour and then map your experiences of what to do next pirates of the caribbean is always a long wait i would recommend to begin your day in new orleans square where much of the popular attractions are located hack late november to early january is the most beautiful time of the year to experience disneyland i find it less crowded and wait line times are minutes and less i ve been going to disneyland when there were colored tickets to get on the rides did i just date myself disneyland is overpriced food is uneventful yet the new orleans square has good food food is pricey lines can be so long that your hour day may only be rides families come to disneyland for a technology alternative togetherness unfortunately the long lines will tempt you to take out your phones to entertain your children rather than endure the complaining parades and other events are worth delving into let me know how these hacks optimize your experience ,5,2019-04-24
1068,3 Disneyland Secrets to Decode,pure magic for both children and adults alike happiest place on earth how can you not be happy at disneyland sure it is a little expensive but when you really immerse yourself in the experience it is money well worth spending we had days nights and purchased the park hopper tickets definitely recommend the park hopper as you can come and go as it suits ,4,2019-04-24
1069,Disneyland you were everything we dreamed of,great place for people like me that prefer the more relaxing in life than the thrill seekers its never been a cheap destination and it has only increased in price but i would still recommend it at least once pirates of the caribbean big thunder railroad indiana jones rides have always been go to for me,5,2019-04-23
1070,Worth the trip,we found this park to provide family friendly fun with a variety of shows and rides we pre paid our tickets to save time which was a benefit and were glad we paid extra for the park hopper tickets which give flexibility to move between the parks as you wish over the days to suit the rides attractions you want to do i enjoyed this park the most there is a range of eateries so not just fast food and there are lots of shopping options for disney merchandise if that s what you like we enjoyed the mix magic fireworks music light show every day and only wished we had watched the other show also the parade was fun too and both were impressive there can be long queues for some rides but waiting times vary and are displayed to inform your decision although fast pass could be purchased for an extra cost when we visited we also found that around show parade times queues reduced for some rides ,4,2019-04-23
1071,Fun,my partner and i paid each for tickets to this park as my partner wanted to see the original disney castle when paying for the tickets nothing was mentioned about a couple of issues we had firstly we walked through and tried to take a photo using a selfie stick to be told we either have to throw it away or take it back to the car or hotel as they are banned so we had to leave and come back again then once we finally got back in we saw countless people with cameras on selfie sticks which was very annoying but not as annoying as them not pre telling us before paying that the castle isn t even visible as they are working on it or something it was just wooden panels with a castle painted on it so we paid full price for partial access and activities to be available to us we should have been told as we d have left the park for another la holiday and not wasted disney this is unacceptable and a true disappointment the only good thing was out breakfast in the carnation cafe where the staff were superb and the apple cinnamon pancakes to die for all in all a very expensive disappointing day thanks to disney not pre advising people at the gate as to what works were or are being carried out ,5,2019-04-23
1072,Disneyland is a Magical Place to Visit,disneyland is always a magical place to visit with friends and family or even on your own for a day ,5,2019-04-23
1073,Happiest place on Earth,my wife and i loved disneyland we spent days with a day hopper pass in between california adventure and disneyland we still could have spent more time in both the family and happy atmosphere is compulsive and can t wait to get back stay for the fireworks down main street plenty of wifi hot spots food stores and great gift shops unexpectedly good rides like the small small world in fantasyland are a must ,5,2019-04-23
1074,"It’s Disney, what more do you need?",this was our first visit to disneyland after two previous visits to dw we felt slightly cheated as they were refurbishing the castle and it was closed down however we had a great time we did the adult only thrill seeking ride thing we really enjoyed indiana jones but make sure you re in the front the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean rides hm and pirates are both much better than dw ,5,2019-04-22
1075,Family holiday at disneyland,disneyland was an amazing experience it was clean organised with lots of staff highly recommend getting the fast pass for one of the days so you can do all the fast pass access rides in the one day the ship and island rides close at pm so plan accordingly the night performance is definitely worth it fast pass gets you better entry into the show also get there early around am to beat the rush merchandise is very expensive there we ended by buying from the disney outlet in citadel the pizza express in tomorrowland has great food and an excellent dinner option when you want to see the night show ,4,2019-04-22
1076,I don't think I will ever get tired of going to this theme park.,i wish they had better food restaurant choices but the attractions make up for this deficit so it s all good ,5,2019-04-22
1077,So much better than Disney world,i m a florida resident so disney world holds a special place in my heart we only had time to visit park in anaheim and everyone else was pushing for disneyland i really wanted to go to california adventure so glad i was out voted disneyland is so adorable and quaint compared to the much larger disney world the lines were much shorter the people much friendlier and you could see the parade right from the lines it was great happy i went ,5,2019-04-21
1078,Solid 4 stars with a few things that I wish were different,so here are the pros lots of characters located throughout the park fun rides incredible shows overall atmosphere cons long lines fast pass not what you think although it does help not as many rides for the year old plus compared with other parks summary nice place to visit at least once in your life to say you have been there we really enjoyed the overall atmosphere at disneyland but the fast pass was not what you think as you can get two to three rides per day for adults that are pretty chill waiting in long lines isn t a big deal but with crazy twins it can make it a little challenging wish there was a true fast pass you could pay extra for to make the overall experience better i d give it a solid b grade wise but liked universal much better,4,2019-04-21
1079,All I saw was the magic,great place please do not hesitate in visiting disney the shows the rides and the food everything it s perfect,5,2019-04-21
1080,What happened to Walts vision?,to all who comes to this happy place welcome well walts vision has been lost along the way over the past few years as this is my third and final trip to disneyland i have never experienced so many rude and obnoxious staff throughout the park as we did this time if the staff are that unhappy with their jobs or pay then step aside and give a job to someone who wants to work disney has just turned into a massive cash cow who can t handle the large crowds but keep jamming people into the park until it becomes uncomfortable we were fully aware of the large crowds of the christmas period but disneyland promoted activities for you to enjoy and when we arrived at these events people were being moved along by staff saying that you cannot stand there disney have made wifi available in the park aswell and this just leads to people not watching where they are going because all people are doing is looking at phones instead of watching where they are walking do yourself a favor and go to knotts berry farm its a lot cheaper and not as crowded ,1,2019-04-20
1081,Marvelous experience!,the original is the best and taking my kids gave me the chance to feel what my parents did years ago when they took me the park does everything right from the decor to the facilities to the staff pay extra for the maxpass feature with photos it s excellent allowing you to get fast passes on your phone and get the staff to take your picture for you the rides ate great and so are the shows can t say enough good things ,5,2019-04-20
1082,Just another cliche review,yes i will admit that this review is very cliche of a disney advertising campaign or anything you have heard elsewhere about disneyland however if you ask anyone of us in the family you ll get the same answer it was awesome after starting the day by entering the park hassle free we went off to get brain washed by it s a small world i couldn t get the bloody song out of my head for the rest of the day and i think it really is some sort of psychological programming that sets up the remainder of the experience leaving their with a huge weird zombie smile on my face we proceeded to experience the rest and it was a hoot the rides were all pretty cool in their own way and the shows were all over the top which is what you come to expect i guess it s the place where you easily get drawn into all the entertainment on hand and have a fantastic time this is one place where everything is made to cater for everyone rarely did we see kids having tantrums or parents pulling their hair out you just go there and have fun full stop there is nothing more you need to do definitely worth the extra few bucks getting the fast pass and definitely need the day park hopper includes adventure park which is also a must in my opinion we had a great time that now we are looking at a possibility of going back or visiting another disneyland in either japan or paris it is worth every penny for a family holiday and an awesome opportunity to bond ,5,2019-04-20
1083,Lots of Fun!,had a fun couple of days fastpass was so worth it the park is not as big as i expected and you could pretty much see do everything in two days the dance party at night pm with the fireworks was actually so much fun and as an adult i wasn t expecting it haha ,5,2019-04-20
1084,The Wonderful World of Disney!,get on your comfy clothes and shoes have cash sunscreen sunglasses and be prepared to wait sometimes relax and give in to the experience and have a fantastic time ,5,2019-04-20
1085,"Be Smart, use your Smartphone, Get the Disney Max Pass, and get the ""Disney Wait Times App""!",i highly recommend you do your research before you visit disneyland anaheim ca you can go to disneyland com and find out so many things before your day s at the disneyland resort you can find out which rides are closed for refurbishment plan for showtimes and parades if you like those or want to avoid them you can research all menus and plan your meals and make special restaurant reservations if you want i d recommend booking reservations online days before your trip most importantly download and use the max pass when you get to disneyland have a disney photographer link a max pass card to your smartphone and all the disney photos taken by the disney photographers are automatically loaded to your disney account to collect and download later the max pass is pp per day and we found it to be so worth it the max pass helps you to easily arrange for all your fast passes on one smartphone rather than running to fast pass distribution centers of each ride we used this in conjunctions with the disney wait times app so simple to use to plan your rides based on wait times and fast passes and along the way the disney photographers including the ride pictures are happy to link the photos to the card and then onto your disney account for you to enjoy the photos for days the disneyland app was also helpful necessary for using the max pass you can store your disneyland park ticket on the phone browse restaurant locations menus and in most cases order your meals before you arrive at the restaurant these apps made our day so much more enjoyable and we were able to visit things we d never seen or done before ,4,2019-04-20
1086,Lots of family fun,we had a great time the park is super beautiful although the castle is still being renovated we were a little disappointed we did not get to see the iconic castle it s nice to go during the week when it s not super super crowded the wait time is in lines weren t bad at all can t wait to start planning our next disney trip ,5,2019-04-20
1087,Great Disney Vacation,this was our first trip to disneyland we live on the east coast and i have been to disney world many times like i actually found some things at disneyland to be nicer likewise some things i prefer at disney world i wouldn t say one is nicer than the other just different even the same corresponding rides are different at each park for example i found the haunted mansion and it s a small world to be nicer here and splash mountain better at disney world i love that they have a parking deck at disneyland it s only been there since or so because where california adventure is now is what used to be part of their parking lot i think it looks very nice that the sidewalks are brick as a pass to the pink colored concrete of disney world the brick looks more aesthetically pleasing cinderella s castle at magic kingdom florida is prettier though i think it looks very nice that the sidewalks are brick as opposed to the pink colored concrete of disney world the brick looks more aesthetically pleasing cinderella s castle at magic kingdom in florida is prettier than sleeping beauty s though i really love this park and will be back ,5,2019-04-18
1088,Every Year...the HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!,expensive value for your money priceless that s right mouseketeer s disneyland resorts are the happiest places on earth period end of story love it or leave it year after year we make at least one trek to this place in anaheim ca to revel in our own epicureanism and it s worth every penny parking at this point is per day preferred parking is more tickets start at per day at the ticket booth if your good with that then go and once you re in the park let go relax and forget all your worries the rides the atmosphere the food the cleanliness the incredible sculpted plantings and all those fabulous disney team members will take your breath away the best part just being there the worst part leaving it can be crowded so do your due diligence on line before hand we have never had the experience where we were disappointed due to the amount of people in attendance blackout days will be crowded that s why they are blackout days be sure to stay long enough to enjoy the evening fireworks spectacular and every night planning months to a year in advance is your best bet as soon as we leave and get home from a wonderful disneyland vaca we are planning the next visit this week in this reviewer s opinion disneyland has earned this highly recommend points review ,5,2019-04-18
1089,Loved it!,i found i liked disneyland better than disney world it is not so overwhelming sweet could have easily spent more time just soaking it in every detail has been attended to as well as it is sooo clean ,5,2019-04-18
1090,Iconic Theme Park,this iconic theme park has a lot to offer and it is worthwhile doing some homework before committing to a visit check favourable times in terms of potential overcrowding research deals to take advantage of dynamic pricing and install and master the fast pass app also as far as possible check on any maintenance scheduled for landmark attractions and rides ,4,2019-04-17
1091,Every Kid's Dream,i took my four year old son to disneyland two weeks ago and the glow still hasn t worn off it was legitimately the greatest day of his life both as a kid and as a parent watching a kid going to disneyland is one of the best parts of living on earth absolute bucket list item for everyone on the planet so special ,5,2019-04-16
1092,Spring Break 2019,best trip ever it all started at the grand california with one of the best customer service moves ever i recently broke my leg and was expecting on renting a wheelchair i ran into on of my old friends who worked at valet after catching up for about a half hour i politely asked if they had wheelchairs so i didn t have to walk to the whole way to the park in a blink of an eye he went back to the back room and pulled one out for me i had a fully automatic wheelchair for the park disney s cast and crew were extremely accommodating in regards to the chair saved the trip ,5,2019-04-15
1093,Best part,i like this part of disneyland best main st is excellent the food atmosphere are great using fast pass helps even with long wait times they keep you busy so it s not too bad ,5,2019-04-15
1094,Sisters Birthday Getaway,traveled to disneyland with my sister and niece we all have been to disney world several times was surprised how close in proximity the parks were in land as apposed to world everything was magical ,5,2019-04-15
1095,Great,loved loved loved not my first visit to a disney park but it was absolutely great wait times were a little high as it was in the beginning spring break but def worth it food is a little expensive so if you want make sure you fill up on a massive breakfast to sustain you though the day unfortunately the castle was under refurbishment or something as it was all covered up which was sad but hey disney is disney ,5,2019-04-15
1096,So Much Variety,a little expensive in some areas but a great variety food vendors everywhere no shortage the park was a magical place loved every moment ride show fantastic love fantasia would love to go back great experience had a day pass and needed it ,5,2019-04-15
1097,"Wait, Wait, Wait",long lines hrs for one ride was a little much for active kiddos but the ride was great once we got on it ,5,2019-04-15
1098,Happiest Place,i can never get enough of disneyland it never disappoints always clean and workers are great we will be back,5,2019-04-15
1099,Completely Magical,we spent two days at disneyland we had a maxpass totally worth it which was awesome so we were able to do every ride some two or three times we loved every minute of it the classic rides are still so fun and remarkable to think of when they were created the newer ones are super fun and thrilling we all had different favorites space mountain star tours autopia jungle cruise big thunder haunted mansion splash mountain the employees are incredibly helpful and kind the park is super clean and fantasmic is just jaw dropping you have to go see it ,5,2019-04-15
1100,You can’t go wrong with the Mouse!,we went with our family and had a great time although the grandparents needed a nap one day the disney app is excellent for wait times on favorite rides and it can be a little crowded on weekends the cast members and staff are so accommodating happiest place ever ,5,2019-04-15
1101,Definitely the happiest place on Earth,our day park hopper pass with maxipass allowed us to experience every ride at least twice and avoid the long queue of up to hours on some rides it is definitely the happiest place on earth all the staff were pleasant and helpful the grounds were clean and vent kids i long lines were happy and patient i would recommend the maxipass to make full use of your time in the park ,5,2019-04-15
1102,Always fun,i just went back for the first time in years dlr is showing its age but it is still fun there is a lot of work being done around the park which takes away a little of the atmosphere more than a couple of the rides stopped mid ride the frequent interruption is off putting it was very busy but that was to be expected most lines moved fairly well definitely take advantage of the single rider lines at dlr and dca if you don t mind your party being split up a little it is a huge time saver i was able to ride matterhorn space mountain and indiana jones many times with little wait ,4,2019-04-14
1103,Intergenerational trip to Disneyland Park,in spite of the rain we had a wonderful time it really is the happy place bring your own rain gear and save some money we enjoyed a mid afternoon lunch as we waited for and then watched the main street parade the light show was spectacular and well worth staying for although it was a bit too loud for my ears and so i had to turn down my hearing aids be sure to use very good and comfortable walking shoes that are also water resistant ,5,2019-04-14
1104,Simply Magic,we took our daughter to disneyland for her first time this week she had an magical time disney never disappoints the lines were not that bad and we enjoyed every ride fantasmic was an amazing show and the night dance and fireworks were so much fun we did the minnie mouse character breakfast in the park and it was so worth every penny our little even got a late night up close and personal dance with mickey and pluto we just got home but can t wait to go back ,5,2019-04-14
1105,Disneyland Family Trip,spent days of day pass at this location was great family trip not as busy at night and great to get a lot of rides in with fast pass fast pass helped a lot ,5,2019-04-14
1106,It’s Disneyland. Enjoy the magic.,we went with two young boys we used a double stroller ours is the citi mini gt double we had a great trip and enjoyed a very different trip from when we would go before kids parades the disneyland band buzz lightyear astro blasters and autopia were huge hits for the kids small world and pirates kept them very entertained as well ,5,2019-04-14
1107,Disney is the best,enjoyed all the rides and having the maxpass is a must and very worth it enjoyed the rides and the fireworks and parades it s a small world is still timeless ,5,2019-04-14
1108,Happiness,i wish i can go there this is awesome place for real happiness you must go there minimum once in your entire life ,5,2019-04-14
1109,Mini Vacay,we love disneyland we took a nice little trip taking advantage of southern california discount ticket and rented a room from a neighboring hotel food was good rides were great as usual the staff was friendly we spent one day at california adventure which was way too crowded and the other two days at disneyland which was not bad as far as the wait times we took advantage of fast passes and went on rides during parade and showtimes we had a great time we re exhausted and it was money well spent the only thing that was not good was the cream cheese filled pretzels next time i ll get a churro thanks mickey ,5,2019-04-13
1110,Birthday celebration,had a blast we spent the whole day there excited to bring my grandkids here soon lots of characters out taking pictures,5,2019-04-13
1111,Great park,my family and i really enjoyed our time at this park we especially enjoyed the meet and greets the rides and the food and restaurants we also liked the parades and fireworks would highly recommend ,5,2019-04-13
1112,"Great time spent with my now boyfriend, then it was reuniting with a high school friend",it s a busy time of year to go but the christmas decorations were beautiful which brought you into the spirit of christmas the rides were fun too ,5,2019-04-13
1113,First visit - comparing to Disney World,after several visits to disney world in florida my daughter requested to visit disneyland this year none of us have ever been we absolutely loved this park if you do not have a lot of time to spend at the park than i cannot stress enough how worth it the maxpass is we paid for the day and we had done all the rides with fastpass by midday which left us enough time to do the rest of the rides by early evening we found this park to be kept very clean and the rides were great i liked the classic rides that are not in florida most of the rides that are the same as florida are not the same space mountain small world pirates are all better at disneyland in my opinion the monorail is better too the employees here were fine but definitely not as disney as they are in florida i don t really care about that but i definitely noticed it they don t seem that interested in talking to guests most of them were chatting with other employees and not paying attention to guests and that would never happen in florida also the food options are better on florida in my opinion i do like the fastpass system here better although you have to pay it is worth it overall we had a great time and we will be back ,5,2019-04-13
1114,Don’t go on a Monday,we spent days at disney with our kids hoping that they d enjoy it as much as i had as a kid unfortunately the greed of disney has destroyed some of the magic the monday was so busy that we almost left i made a complaint about the overcrowding and was told to join a queue to complain some of the rides are years old and need to be retired my kids laughed at many of them the fast pass system is poor go to universal and see a proper fastpass system in action our next two days were much better it was a shame that the first day left such a bad taste in the mouth this was my th time at disney and i think it s my last ,3,2019-04-13
1115,So Fun!!,we just returned from our trip the second week of april this was a fantastic time to go wait times for the rides were very reasonable max pass is a must we enjoyed the fastpass feature this gave us from our phones on the disney app it was so easy to book our rides and as a result we were able to go from ride to ride with little wait the max pass doesn t have all rides but has the most popular ones covered the max pass also gets you all photos taken by cast members or on the rides themselves at no additional cost do yourself a favor and get the max pass the food in the park is great it can get a bit spend but it is convenient if you want to book reservations at the restaurants in the park do so well before your trip via the app most of the restaurants were booked well in advance of our trip that said many of the other places to eat give the option to place a mobile order we used the app to order food and waited only minutes and never stood in line don t forget those comfortable walking shoes and sunscreen overall our trip was amazing can t wait to go back ,5,2019-04-12
1116,Disneyland more like.... um ... good place,great place but there are hundreds of other reviews that can tell you that so umm ya that s it good place i recommend it,5,2019-04-12
1117,Happiest Place On Earth,disneyland has been my second home since i was nine years old i am now i go as often as i can and always enjoy myself if i take friends we have a blast sharing our remembrances or new experiences and if i go alone i am always thrilled to see folks enjoying and being in awe of the many experiences the park has to offer ,5,2019-04-12
1118,Fun,great time warm sunny weather lots and lots of big strollers now i see why they are doing a restriction,5,2019-04-11
1119,Amazing!,started our pch road trip here for days visit took our year old daughter and i was skeptic on what it would be like it was amazing the rides are great and so much effort and originality in them make sure you use the fastpass to skip queues daughter loved the characters even though it can get busy everyone seems so courteous and polite it makes walking around pleasurable ,5,2019-04-11
1120,Not adviced,old setup smelly some games under renovations others got broke while in the line or even inside it when complained the responsible person said either leave or wait at least one hour till we fix it no apology even racers and haunted mansion house games visit euro disney or orlando much better ,1,2019-04-09
1121,Disneyland park Paris,i give this park a grandkids loved the park it s catered for young older kids face painting disney character photo opportunity restaurant s loads more,5,2019-04-09
1122,Such a happy place, day hopper park has allowed us plenty of time to do all the rides we wanted to in both parks and then double up on favourites used the fast pass system a few times but generally found that if we used the disneyland app throughout the day to check wait times we could determine when to do the popular rides we also used ridemax to help with planning our day ,5,2019-04-09
1123,Love disneyland!,disneyland is the happiest place on earth it should include the maxpass with the ticket prices it is a money grab and i don t like that moblie oredinrg was cool on the app they should also have more vegy fresh food options like california adventure hey have very few and i went to one and it was closing right in the middle of the day and the next one was so far away ,5,2019-04-08
1124,Great time at Disneyland,had a good time at the park the park has many rides for all ages and although it was crowded as expected we were still able to do those rides we wanted the park didn t feel cramped as in the case of california adventures ,5,2019-04-08
1125,Happiest Place on Earth,i grew up coming to disneyland and now i have season passes and bring my own kids i am always amazed at disney s customer service they do the best job of making you feel like you really are at the happiest place on earth i love their efficiency with wait times and i m a huge fan of the fast pass i especially love that you can download the app and check wait times on your phone ,5,2019-04-08
1126,Disappointed,i am really disappointed with disneyland old tired over crowded and prices are simply a money grab the fast pass is a rip off and only allows you to reserve a ride every hours fast pass again is a money grab that allows people to pay extra money to jump the queue in front of other customers this is so wrong on many levels honest paying customers having to wait in line longer while others jump the queue i absolutely hate what the fast pass allows it makes my blood boil as these rich people jump the queue ahead of me from listening to others in the lines others agree poor form the characters are hardly seen forget a photo there are so many people admission price really very over priced put of stars,1,2019-04-07
1127,Loved it!!,we visited with our year old with park hopper to california adventures absolutely loved every minute the max pass feature is awesome we used it to ride all the major attractions with no wait fyi get your radiator springs racer pass early they were out by noon ,5,2019-04-07
1128,Disneyland visit first week of April.,purchased day passes for family of three usd cdn only went two days and skipped third day due to absurd ride wait times in california park averaging to hours in lineups and long wait times in disneyland park averaging minutes plus in california park one could use standard ticket for fast pass return time however only a few rides offered this option and most rides closed fastpass lines by lunch time while of course disney does some things great and unbeatable the current ride wait time is unacceptable for money charged for multi way passes only was able to do four rides in two days as was interested in the most popular rides hmmm ,2,2019-04-07
1129,Disneyland was the most fun we had in California,disneyland was the most fun our family had while we were visiting california the park is well laid out and all of the rides are designed for a vast age range younger children will enjoy the park as well as the older adults there was always something to see and do the food was very good we had a great time there on holiday ,5,2019-04-07
1130,Disney trip,very clean and everyone is super friendly the only struggle we had was the line ups i wish i had known we could get through quicker with my sons autism diagnosis that would have prevented a lot of meltdowns and being over stimulated but otherwise we did have a blast so anyone with kids on the spectrum look into that ,5,2019-04-06
1131,truly is the happiest place on earth and probably the most expensive.,this place is magic everyone needs to go to disneyland in their lives but they must plan accordingly save money ,5,2019-04-05
1132,It’s Disney!,not sure why there are two separate reviews for each park the line up to get in was long security was tight i was a upset they took my selfie stick i didn t see anything on any website saying you can t bring these in although i m sure it s there somewhere they give you the option of taking it back but we had hopped a bus from the hotel most hotels are within walking distance to the huge parking lots to the park and then there is a minute bus ride to get there for the long line to get in get there early the park gets more and more crowded as the day goes on it took a little while to figure out how the fast pass worked you have to use the app it didn t seem to work very fast you d get a timed entry but it was hours away and you can t book another time until you do that ride and we weren t there on a particularly busy day i can t imagine on a summer weekend we were there for only one day and i suppose this is why folks book multiple days we were too adults and got to see a lot of it in the one long day but it s impossible with kids the shopping area outside the parks downtown disney was great with lots and lots of shops and places to eat ,4,2019-04-05
1133,Kids dream!,this was our second visit here the first being years ago i will say it was all in all a great time a couple of the attractions were closed for refurbishment one being indiana jones which was a little disappointing but other than that the day was pretty smooth rides were not overly busy the fastpass system worked really well we had a rougher day at california land the day previously where lines were a lot longer and more rides closed here was more effecient i will say though that i think the prices are tough to take we are not well off but we also don t do too bad and i feel they are high you pay a lot to get in and then more money is required to do the small stands like shooting games basketball hoops etc which i feel should be included just don t give prizes away they would be great to play whilst waiting around etc also it was a little rainy that day luckily i listened to my good lady and took a raincoat many didn t have coats though as it did start off warm and sunny now this is where disneyland made some good money they were selling the cheapest plastic ponchos available for each i seen thousands of them mostly torn and ripped it would have been nice if people could have bought them for sub i honestly felt bad for the people there that saved up a long time to fulfill kids dreams and then get gouged apart from the money side it really is a great experience especially for the kids the staff are mostly friendly and it is run well ,4,2019-04-04
1134,Very nice day,a very pleasant experience nice and friendly staff good food and a relaxing atmosphere the rides are fun and the variety is great,5,2019-04-04
1135,Max pass not worth it. Made things worse,the max pass worked ok for disneyland but not california adventure all the fast passes are gone within a few hours so it is a waste the new system has doubled the wait times in the stand by lines because as they will tell you fast pass riders have priority under the old system you pulled a fast pass ticket for free when you time to use it came you stood in a short line while you waited for the fast pass time you stood in a line now you either stand in a line for fast pass if you can get one or you stand in a line with a few hour wait time this was all a scheme for disney to make more money and in the end it made things worse as far as wait times go ,1,2019-04-04
1136,Always the highlight of the trip!,both parks are a must but on a day park hopper definitely spend of the days here the classics are all there the matterhorn space mountain pirates splash mountain indiana jones star tours and on and on great ice cream shop on main street golden horseshoe is a goodlittle restaurant to stop for a quick snack have to go here at least once in your life ,5,2019-04-03
1137,Hooray For Walt,i love this place took our grandkids there and it was really their magic kingdom while i personally don t ride many of the rides iit s fun to watch the kids they went far out of their way for our grandsons birthday the express pass for rides is great ,5,2019-04-02
1138,Great Time!,haven t been to disneyland in years took our daughters for the first time and we had a blast not just with the rides but with the parade dancing with the characters at night and the water show ,5,2019-04-02
1139,Spring Break 2019,we had a great time at disneyland it was nice to see fantasmic after missing the last few times although we didn t have a great spot we did our first trip years ago and it s likely our last with the kids so it was special we stayed off site but close enough to walk pros it s disney love pirates indiana jones space mountain etc we got to see a little of star wars land which looks pretty impressive cons it was very crowded the castle was being refurbished not an issue for us but if you had a year old princess lover it could be a problem the current fireworks are not nearly as good as the old ones kind of odd for us i think this is our th trip so we know the park very well and move around it all the time our kids had the app down to get quick time estimates we found some times when ride times were low and were generally out of park mid afternoon but there early and late we quickly found out it was best to hit rope drop a the park not on early hours to get in some quick rides ,5,2019-04-02
1140,Wonderful,great been to see multiple times and enjoyed the visit here immensely would recommend marissa if visiting during a busy time ,5,2019-04-02
1141,Hap Hap happiest place on earth,what a great time we had kids under having a stroller was key everyone was helpful and friendly use the baby care centre if needed switch off is also key,5,2019-04-01
1142,It's all about the max-pass.,the best way to experience the park is to enjoy the rides as well as exhibits to get the most out of the rides the group needs at least one person savvy with the cell phone app system we were lucky to have an organizer who tapped into the max pass fast pass system ,5,2019-04-01
1143,Always a Magical Time,we went on our magic morning and was a bit disappointed with this extra hour of fun as we found most everything was closed only one land is open which includes buzz light year space mountain and star wars we found that most people just line up at another land waiting until am to be the first ones into that land otherwise disney is always a great time just to stroll down main street is enjoyable be sure to get a reservation early if you want to eat at one of the sit down restaurants they book up fast otherwise there are lots of great choices at the walk up counters my favorite the fried chicken at the plaza at the end of main street enjoy ,5,2019-04-01
1144,Horrible Visit!,came for anniversary trip rides were extremely long couple of them broke down the castle was under construction and no where does it even state this some people come for the whole experience what a huge disappointment for the large amount of money you spent visited both parks and were extremely overcrowded i m so happy to see you are making it no smoking maybe you could make it an adults only morning admission sometime i have kids and we went for a little getaway and gift to each and it was not even what we thought my experience at the other park was the worst i was knocked over by a little boy just horrible it was a horrible visit this truly is not the happiest place on earth ,1,2019-04-01
1145,FUN Disney stuff.,parking day be the last to exit the park and easily find your car great stores and food check out the premium mickey chocolate covered ice cream bar to die for ,5,2019-04-01
1146,"Fix your rides, wifi and communication",dear disneyland after paying usd for tickets for my family i don t think i m being unreasonable to ask for the following disneyland castle i couldn t believe that there wasn t any notifications to advise you are renovating the castle and it s currently all covered up we missed our chance for the iconic photo in front of the castle working rides we wasted so much time on your broken down rides we were stuck inside splash mountain for mins and then escorted out of the canoes through the attraction and out to the backlot there was no apology indiana jones broke down times my husband and daughter were stuck for mins and we were turned around twice due to the ride malfunctioning haunted mansion closed as we approached with our fast pass and then we went up to roger rabbit in toontown only to be told the ride is closed after lining up then being part of an angry mob of people who were turned away and having to rejoin the back of the queue when it reopened please update your app to advise when rides are closed fix your wifi your wifi reminds me of australia s nbn never working and only available in a couple of spots around the place in it s a minimum to offer wifi especially with a large percentage of international travellers crowd control last thursday i felt like a sardine there must be a limit to the number of people who can access this place it was really unpleasant being squashed in a crowd with young children and aggressive pram pushers the good fast passes and golden hour i would have left disney without these options also having the option to go to california adventure park it s a shame that it s taken me years to get to disneyland and although i enjoyed my day it was ted the magical experience that i hoped for ,2,2019-04-01
1147,It’s Disneyland!!!!!,it truly is the happiest place on earth pay the money and get a fast pass for sure but make sure you understand how it works a little confusing to say the least everything is expensive but to be expected if your canadian check for their canadian prices for the park pass ,5,2019-04-01
1148,Disney,the park was outstanding the characters and rides were amazing only downfall was the enormous waiting times of the major attractions did not get to enjoy all the rides due to this overall had a ball ,4,2019-04-01
1149,Disnerds travel to “the other Disney”,my daughter who is are huge disnerds we go to disney world frequently my daughter has already been there times and that s not counting the trip she made in utero i was at disneyland years ago but my daughter had never been there i was afraid i d be disappointed but i wasn t some things were very similar or identical to things at magic kingdom but there was enough that was different that i knew i was not at disney world i like their magic pass system better than disney world s in some ways but it was a pain carting our tickets around luckily i had heard about that ahead of time we picked out lanyards on etsy overall it was a great trip i m so glad we went ,5,2019-04-01
1150,It is Disneyland!!!,who doesn t know about disneyland this place to me is better than disneyworld it is smaller but way better rides always a great time get the maxpass so you do not have to wait online get fastpasses right to your phone mickey is waiting ,5,2019-03-31
1151,Fun place to visit with family. Park has activities for all ages,disneyland has some activity for all ages to spend the day it gets really crowded on major holidays we were there end of march for spring break and the park is loaded and see people doing park hoping from the adjacent adventureland all through the day took the day pass for disneyland alone bought online and saved and took the maxpass ticket after seeing the crowd through disney mobile app the maxpass was in trial period as of march and it offered speed pass to few rides not all maxpass included photopass which allows you to download pictures shot by the photographers in the park and from some rides it definitely helped to quickly get to the rides with less than minutes wait compared to minutes to more than an hour wait for some rides you can still get fasttrack using your ticket in the stations next to the rides you can reserve time for rides through the disney app with the maxpass but it allowed you to reserve only one ride at any given time we need to wait for an hour to reserve another ride you cannot reserve all rides at your preferred time in one shot the wait time keeps changing every few minutes based on the crowd only issue with reservation is the rides in demand have long wait times and may not be available when you closer to the ride in the park you have to reserve whatever is available and walk back and forth between different parts of the park it is still worth for the money and i definitely recommend taking maxpass,4,2019-03-31
1152,Read blogs before you go,we took our year old for the first time we booked a three day pass with one park per day we did not book the maxpass on any day and i m glad she was only able to ride the little kid rides and it wouldn t have been worth it our daughter is shy but after the first day wanted to meet all of the characters this was surprising to us so i would advise you to be flexible with your plans we did two days in the magic kingdom park and one day in california adventure this truly seemed like the right call for our family the park is delightful and there is something for everyone i would highly advise you to read all disney blogs you can find before you go there are people who spent a lot of time in disneyland and california adventure who have a lot of great advise there is a blog for everything you have a question about ,5,2019-03-31
1153,Really the Happiest Place on Earth,so here s the thing it is expensive but you can bring in your own food and supplies and bring an empty water bottle you can fill it again all over the park the park is open for hours ech day and so compared to another major attraction in so cal this one is by far the most reasonable for a family and value for your money per hour it off the charts we were able to get day park hoppers for the price of one day hours at another attraction if you have to choose between disney and another location for your family this is the place you can save some money believe it or not ,5,2019-03-31
1154,Disneyland relive your youth,the park was just as much fun as when i visited in the s the fantasmic night time production was spectacular it is definitely worth getting a fastpass to view it ,5,2019-03-30
1155,Happiest Place on Earth,disneyland is so much fun for families highlights include splash mountain space mountain peter pan s flight and the matterhorn the park gets very busy by late morning fast pass helps get you on the rides throughout the day the only negative is the cost it s not cheap they give you a lot of food for the price but beverages are very expensive ,5,2019-03-30
1156,amazing imagination and pagentry,bought a season pass probably wont be able to use it enough for it to pay for itself but it is still a bit of a thrill way way overcrowded way long lines to ride even the more pedestrian of attractions still interesting fun thrilling colorful costly understatement ,4,2019-03-29
1157,Hectic Day but fun,with two of my girlfriends we visited disneyland it was a bucket list item and for the most part fun finding our way to attractions we wanted to see was more difficult then it should of been but we managed to get there when the park opened and enjoy three fast pass attractions the food and water was a little expensive since we visited during spring break time the regular price was increased by there were attractions closed which included the cinderella castle for the extra money all things should be open lots of strollers scooters and people everywhere by pm ,3,2019-03-29
1158,"Oh, How Fun!",my cousin came down from n california and we decided to spend the day at disneyland we arrived early quickly went to adventure land to get in line for pirates of the caribbean and the ride is as good as memory served next we went to haunted mansion since teri had never gone on it before our blue bayou restaurant for lunch was next the sleeping beauty castle is currently being renovated so a huge cover is what one sees shows a pic of the castle the character parade was filled with floats colorful dancers and performers in the evening a light show takes place on the river of the americas and at the fireworks display goes on next to the castle the castle s cover now acts as a projection screen with a variety of animated disney characters singing and dancing on it the park closed at midnight so before that time shopping at the emporium on main street was our last stop before heading for the hotel s shuttle bus ,5,2019-03-29
1159,Happiest Place on Earth Needs Repairs,we paid quite a lot for admission and parking and expected to take multiple rides instead we wasted several hours of our time waiting in lines for rides that broke down pirates of the caribbean and thunder mountain the grounds were beautifully maintained staff were outstanding the the environment was spectacular walt disney would not be pleased with electronic breakdowns is disneyland being simply being loved to death more work needs to be done on guest through put and rides being in working order ,3,2019-03-29
1160,Fantastic park for grandchild age 5,we had a fabulous time with our granddaughter and her family to celebrate her th birthday the rides were great except that pinocchio scared her and she absolutely enjoyed splash mountain she insisted on sitting in the first seat and thought it was funny to get soaked she got to meet a lot of characters including capt hook the mad hatter minnie mouse eeyore and winnie the pooh she met gaston who was totally in character and would not sign her book insisted she was in love with him etc pretty funny she loved it s a small small world buzz lightyear astro blasters the tea cups dumbo and her makeover at the bibbidi bobbed boutique followed by in person meeting with princesses ariel cinderella and snow white she enjoyed the afternoon parade the nighttime light show churros and a corn dog all in all an expensive but amazing experience ,5,2019-03-28
1161,Disney California Adventures disappoints,extremely long wait times and short ride duration posted wait time min and ended up waiting for and hours at cars ride fast passes out by am some staff helpful but normally looking like they would rather be somewhere else food costs high and again staff unenthusiastic at providing assistance we ve been to disney florida universal florida and california and have never encountered wait times like this there is no entertainment no updates on wait times or staff available when waiting in these lines just the same tracks of music playing over and over very disappointing way to spend the day and lots of money ,1,2019-03-28
1162,Disneyland,no les recomiendo visitar disneyland esta bien ocupado y las lineas vien largas mas de dos horas es ridiculo y los tickets bien caros uno trabaja bien dura por su dinero no es justo que cobren tanto espere mad de horas para el juego de carros radiators spring para que me dijeran que se desconpuso no se los recommiendo no es gusto para uno como papa tener que esperar tanto really busy and long wait for rides we waited hours for radiator springs racer just to me told the ride was not working they gave us a fast past but still its ridiculous we had day park tickets so we went the next day and got a fast past to avoid the issue of waiting when our time came the fast past line was long and the wait was min we could not wait as we had to leave there was a lot of people and tickets are so expensive as an adult i would not want to visit disney again your better off visiting six flags ,1,2019-03-28
1163,Bucket List!,after having already visited wdw paris and shanghai i was excited to add disneyland to the list the park is very similar to paris but sadly the original attractions are a little dated now i think galaxy s edge will be a welcome edition to this park to inject a little life into it fantasmic mickey s mix magic and star tours are must dos ,4,2019-03-28
1164,It was nice,i went here years ago but i really enjoyed the scenery and the attractions and many other things that it provided,4,2019-03-27
1165,Great view of Fantasmic with the reserved dining meal at Hungry Bear Restaurant,we had the ribs with the reserved dining package and a great view of fantasmic you do have to sit on the pavement but the adults enjoyed the show it was a little scary for our year old grand daughter as the focus seemed to be mostly on the villlians and scary parts of disney movies ,5,2019-03-27
1166,Terrible customer service... WARNING be very sure of what you buy,we visited disneyland in october november we bought our day passes online and due to an error online we were unable to buy the canadian rate discount and were charged full rate about at error called disneyland and told them what happened online talked to different service agents at different times agents were rude the last nice all they would say is sorry last agent said try the credit card company or talked to the front gate customer service mastercard said the transaction had already been processed went to the front gate more sorry nothing can be done here go inside and talk to customer relations talked to customer relations just more sorry we can t do anything from another agents i have been to disneyland over times since i will never go back the whole experience ruined our trip be warned disney is a corporation and only cares about their bottom line,1,2019-03-27
1167,First Visit to Disneyland,this was our first visit to disneyland and it was fantastic we have been to the orlando wdw parks many times and they are different this parks may be smaller in size but it still provides all of the excitement and rides for all ages make sure you don t wait for the last night to watch the fireworks if the wind is blowing towards the interstate the fireworks can be cancelled ,5,2019-03-26
1168,Lots of construction work impeded the experience,disneyland is a place i like in general but this visit was a bit disappointing the castle was covered for renovation the dinosaur part of the train ride was also under construction the spaceship in future land was also covered this for a full price entrance i really liked the mickey magic show with the fireworks and the whole feeling of the park ,3,2019-03-26
1169,Happiest (most expensive) place on earth,rides were constantly breaking down or being shut down i didn t mind not seeing a few things due to referbishment indiana jones cinderella s castle but having rides constantly breaking down splash mountain shut down for hours rocky mountain roller coaster shut down after standing in line for min etc staff were all great line ups to get in were long but moved quickly wish there was an early morning option for california park and not just disney as that side is way better if you have older kids or are a kid yourself look for the fast pass kiosks near each ride you can get a new fast pass every hours for free and this enabled us to ride the cars ride times while there get to the fast pass line prior to am as it sells out and then you re waiting for hours to ride unless you have small children avoid toon town rides and even avoid if you have small children as most of the rides are kinda dark and scary pinocchio alice in wonderland etc don t buy bottled water us go to starbucks and ask for a large ice water free eat outside the park if possible bubba gump pho lots of options within walking distance that will save you some ,3,2019-03-26
1170,Disneyland Experience,it was alright good times however it just wasn t the same as fl s disney world in times have changed inflation dollar value has gotten trips to states to be quite costly and customer service is mostly self serve and if i m being honest a bit subpar this vacation was great in a sense as it provided us a mini getaway from our regular living quarters and for reminiscing good times however in comparison i d pick disney world in fl if the price was more reasonable affordable for people from canada visiting there the weather was great during the day and a bit windier at night no fireworks just the light show at night with disney remixes which was a tad disappointing different experience overall good times however as you grow older you will realize what is broken cannot be fixed just have to move on in life ,3,2019-03-26
1171,Happiest Place on Earth,spring break crowds were noticeable in mid march max pass worth the extra money for the popular rides the magic mix fireworks was a great show we arrived at the fantasmic fast pass area about minutes before the time on the fast pass and the line was already very long and we were not really able to see once we made it to the fast past viewing area really enjoyed the minnie and friends breakfast at the plaza inn ,5,2019-03-26
1172,Not quite what I remembered,i had some very fond memories of disneyland from when i was in my late teens i remembered an amazing place and couldn t wait to return fast forward some odd years and i felt a little disappointed most of that comes from me probably over hyping it in my head i just found that it wasn t as magnificent as i remembered i was really disappointed in the prices of everything once inside the park i expected things like souvenirs and food to be overly expensive but at times i felt like it was robbery some of the clothing items especially of course i had to buy a shirt for each family member but it could have been two or three different shirts and or hoodies instead of one t shirt i just had a hard time justifying what they were asking for things the attractions were good and the rides for the most part were ok thankfully we had fastpass or spending the day in lineups would have not been fun and a waste of time overall i do recommend the park for everyone at least once in their lifetime but i am done with it ,4,2019-03-25
1173,Seniors will especially Enjoy a trip to Disneyland in California,this is a wonderful park and so family friendly we traveled here for a convention and took advantage to the discounted convention rate for a one day pass we have been to disney world in florida and liked disneyland better since we were two adult women one a senior we came on a mid week day which was less crowded it is more compact but has so much to offer we especially loved that we could have our pictures made with chewbacca and darth vader in tomorrow land i would recommend taking rain ponchos or purchasing if needed we happened to be here in march and had rain showers for half the day the parades are fabulous and at family friendly times we especially enjoyed the pm evening parade and went minutes early to get a bench seat the park also honors veterans at pm in the main area near the train depot i would recommend if your budget allows to get the photo pass the photographers are so patient and you get some very special pictures at present the cost is about worth every penny the carnation cafe on main street has some really fabulous appetizers that are not costly the chili is great ,5,2019-03-25
1174,So Much Better Than Disney Florida,disneyland is clean easier to get around the people are nicer the food is better and i think the whole california healthier lifestyle just makes it a more enjoyable place to visit the rides were great and the attention to detail in the park made it more of an enjoyable place to visit ,5,2019-03-25
1175,It’s Disney!,the disney experience would have given it five stars but a lot of the rides were not open definitely do the startours ride and indiana jones ride use fastpass otherwise will be stuck in lines much smaller than florida ,4,2019-03-24
1176,Best birthday ever,we went to disneyland on my daughters th birthday and it was magical from her birthday badge to the minnie mouse cupcake she was absolutely in awe of the whole day the food was diverse the rides were amazing the tiny touches make it all so incredible we spent too much money can only be expected but wow you get great bangalow for your buck in terms of your entry ticket my advice is don t ever think day will be enough we ve done days and know we need more time there it really is the happiest place on earth i was surprised to see how un wheelchair friendly it is if you are wheelchair bound there d be little you could do in terms of rides it is incredibly crowded shops and restaurants and eateries very full and most rides said wheelchair users needed to get out of their chair to rides ,5,2019-03-24
1177,2019 March Vacation,was a great experience for our family group of nine ages ranging from to the only reason why i m not giving them stars is because of their fastpass system is inefficient and they had several attractions under maintenance and out of service they should try to go with a system simular to universal s express lane however the total disney experience is awesome and will experience again someday ,4,2019-03-24
1178,b beautiful,so much fun my son loved every minute there love the rides we didn t get to see the castle because is under construction but everything else was fantastic,5,2019-03-23
1179,Always Magic, when you wish upon a star is always true for a trip to disney we ve been to both disneyland and disneyworld and loved them both disneyland out of season was still busy but worth every minute no pre booking needed no lines short waits at rides loved it we didn t use fast pass and didn t wait more than minutes for any ride the downside to off season is that some rides were down for maintenance but very few ,5,2019-03-23
1180,Fun for the maxpass enabled,the maxpass disneyapp and smartphone are essential to enjoy disneyland at peak times fortunately we had all three and a smart phone wiz to schedule all the maxpass rides walking past all the folks in the stand by ie everyone without maxpass fastpass i couldn t help but think disney is making it very tough for those folks we were stuck on two rides on roger rabbit we had to be escorted out of the tunnel on radiator springs california adventure park racers we we stuck for minutes and then ride resumed splash mountain was closed as we neared the entry it closed several times over two days but we did find a window to take the ride several other rides were closed temporarily for technical difficulties during the two days be prepared to alter your route through the park fireworks were cancelled one night due to winds we found the staff cast members to be very helpful and the park was clean despite the large crowds good salads at plaza cafe typically you have to wait in line to meet the characters who are moving throughout the park if you can do it a great but not inexpensive way to have the kids meet a bunch of characters is to have dinner at goofy s kitchen at the disneyland hotel overall basically you ve got to go here but the value for more than one visit is questionable it is pricey kids of course had a great time ,4,2019-03-23
1181,We disliked it. many of the rides were closed for maintenance but we still had to pay,we had a less than average time many of the rides were closed due to maintenance yet we paid over for entry and the bus ride from la ,1,2019-03-22
1182,The Happiest Place on Earth!,i recently became an annual pass holder again after working for disneyland the past and a half years needless to say the magic is still there for me and i can t stay away i ve taken some solo trips but i usually go with family and friends the last time i visited was a family trip with my parents as i got my brothers to pitch in to get them passes too we were were also celebrating my dad s birthday it s spring break season so the parks are crowded but we made the most of our time together we like to take it easy especially when it s so crowded mostly watch shows and eat we were able to watch mickey s mix magic with fireworks my parents first time and fantasmic their first time watching the reimagined version i feel so happy and fortunate that i can reverse the roll and now take them to disneyland and see smiles on their faces experiencing the magic of the parks and time spent together there ,5,2019-03-22
1183,Great Trip,my wife and i are disney world annual pass holders and have been since our kids were little so we wanted to give disneyland a try it is not fair to compare them directly but as a theme park on its own disneyland and california adventure park are a lot of fun we found that the fast pass system worked fine and the wait times on the app did not reflect the actual time waited but we had fun the staff was friendly the food was good the restrooms were clean ,5,2019-03-22
1184,Finally made it,it was everything and more for me and my family word of advice don t try and cram it all into one day impossible we did three and still missed a few things but we finally made it took me years to finally come so happy it was very packed but also very manuverable loved the turkey legs parking is a little crazy but after our first visit we got the hang of it easier to park and walk through downtown disney then wait for the tram overall i think it was magical for me my wife and three kids ,5,2019-03-21
1185,Very Nice. Super Packed.,this park was neat but packed there are plenty of rides and attractions for small children we traveled with teenagers so this one wasn t out favorite ,3,2019-03-21
1186,Security line was terrible!!!,i have been to disneyland many times over the last years and have never encountered a security line like this it was all they way out to harbor then down for a block unbelievable i am used to the lines for the rides but security i did not expect to spend minutes outside the park get it together disneyland ,5,2019-03-21
1187,"Find a world of Adventure, and fun",the saying is true go and visit a place for a day become a kid and have dreams come true what a day of fun and adventure princesses and characters space adventures and future fury friends and rides great food and music it has it all for the young old and in between there is always something for everyone just make sure you go through the week if you don t want to wait in lines for the rides my favourite time is not summer but the cooler months everything makes you feel like you are in a place where all your worries go and the outside world doesn t exist love it ,5,2019-03-21
1188,Disney!,just an amazing place and staff we spent three days here recently and has a great time lines are long and prepare to walk a lot but totally worth it the get your ears on special event running now has a lot of super cute merch and tasty treats to try pick up a food guide at the entrance the maple bacon churro was delish we rode everything we wanted to ate at some new places for us and came back to the hotel every night with aching feet but ready to do it all again the next day,5,2019-03-20
1189,Always Fun For All,you can t go wrong for a fun family outing even though the cost keeps going up i recommend downloading the disneyland app you can make restaurant reservations check wait times for an extra fee daily per person we paid each you can get the max pass which enables you to get your fast pass ride tickets for any ride in disneyland or california adventure from anywhere in either park you can also get any ride pictures or other photopass pictures for no extra charge the max pass is worth the extra money we did not wait for any fast pass ride for more than minutes ,5,2019-03-20
1190,Fun!,feel like a kid again experience the magic of mickey as you ride rides and beer characters walt s dream come to life he was a good man with a good heart love his story of family adoption and always thinking of others ,5,2019-03-20
1191,Great spring break visit.,the weather was a little overcast and high of and it was perfect it wasn t too crowded in the morning and we were able to go on about rides before am that lest enjoy the rest of the day and take our time we signed up for max pass for the first time and highly recommend it it saves you a lot of time from having to walk to go get a fastpass and you can do more than one at a time after i think hours after you reserved the last one it was nice being able to download your ride photos the best was being able to order food from some of the restaurants and it being ready and paid for when you get there can t wait for star wars to open ,5,2019-03-20
1192,Disneyland - magic hours,great time coming back after years indiana jones ride is still amazing kids loved the corny jungle tour be weary of buying extended magic hours because they are only good if you stay in resort and on certain days of the week kids still had a blast ,3,2019-03-20
1193,Walt is turning over in his grave on the management of his dream!!,california adventure was a fantastic day little to complain about after we got over the fact that we couldn t get in for early entry with our magic moments package like we thought our next days at disneyland were fun don t get me wrong it s a fun place but the volume of people allowed entry was ridiculous there were wall to wall people every place we turned the max pass purchase was a saving grace but even that was oversold and a way way overpriced benefit that did not apply to enough of the rides or keep the wait times as low as they should be many lines blended max pass and regular standby waaay too early which made for a lot of disappointment coupled with breakdowns of mr toads wild ride snow whites scary adventure and splash mountain all broke down we had to be evacuated from the first and wait in max pass line for more than minutes only to lose out when ride broke down buzz lightyear ride stopped and started at least a dozen times when we rode it s very sad that money is all this corporation walt built thinks about walt is definitely turning over in his grave ,3,2019-03-20
1194,"Day in Disneyland , California Adventure and Downtown Disney.",fantastic time strolling through the park enjoying the free entertainment taking in the rides and probably one of our favourite places is the tiki room which was also one of walt disney s favourite attractions ,5,2019-03-20
1195,Fabulous,what can i say i had an days in the happiest place on earth and it truly is i thoroughly enjoyed myself the cast members are truly phenomenal helpful polite funny for example i went for breakfast at the riverbelle terrace i was looking forward to trying the monkey bread but i was told that apparently the monkeys caused a huge ruckus and refused to get into the car to come to work so they didn t have any i m still laughing i can t wait for my next visit ,5,2019-03-19
1196,Too crowded,we used to love it at disneyland but the park is literally just getting busier and busier everytime we go it ruins the experience minutes waiting for a minute ride isn t worth it i m not sure there s anything they can do but it won t continue to be our go to destination,2,2019-03-19
1197,Nice to see the original,enjoyed our first visit to disney on the west coast the two parks and downtown disney are all one destination so it s a nice change from all of the travelling between parks at disneyworld there is still a lot to see between both parks but nice to have less travel time to see it all ,4,2019-03-19
1198,Holliday,well what can i say it s disney land good points photos with mickey minnie and all the gang rides and adventures galore the cars ride is a blast you must visit disney at night no matter how old you are it s magical and there s so many places to eat and drink you will be spoiled for choice the down side of disney land it gets so busy it makes you want to go back to your hotel for a break the waiting time for the rides can be minutes which is not good if you have small children the food is obviously nice but can be expensive oh and just one other thing wear a good pair of comfy shoes all that said good and bad it s disney land enjoy ,5,2019-03-19
1199,Check the Calendar,we enjoy disneyland but be sure you check the park calendar if you can go on a day when there are no extra magic hours of major events during the off season ride rides during parades if you have a multi day pass or if parades aren t your thing it gets ever more crowded so if you don t it s just the magical world of waiting ,4,2019-03-19
1200,"Timeless, magical, must do!",disneyland is always fantastic my biggest recommendation is to arrive at the park ish minutes before it opens you can be inside lined up at the ropes before it opens then you get so much more done that first hour ,5,2019-03-19
1201,Pre Birthday visit,as always disneyland beats the expectations everything is always in its place and they make everything magical ,5,2019-03-19
1202,Christmas in Disneyland,its the happiest place on earth it never fails its always a magical experience for both adults and children during christmas it was difficult to get around the crowds with a stroller food is on the expensive side but other than that it was an amazing experience ,4,2019-03-19
1203,AMAZING,i never have any problems with disney ever it really is the happiest place on earth and i will continue to daydream about visiting until the moment i can set foot in the park again one of my favorite places on earth hands down ,5,2019-03-18
1204,Spring Break in the Sun,we spent a week in anaheim over spring break we had lots if fun spent time at huntington beach six flags universal and disney parks definitely got our money s worth from disney with the fastpass phone option it makes it super convenient to use the app and catch all the rides well worth the money if you can swing it and only visiting once it pays to shop for your tickets we were able to save buying day pay hopper tickets from the disney website vs the disney app we had a great time and our teenagers definitely enjoyed the magic of disney ,5,2019-03-18
1205,Disney Magic,every time i turn down main street its pure magic i thought it couldn t get any better than when i was a kid i was wrong watching my kids light up and get so excited when they see the castle or riding splash mountain make it all worth it i love this place and we make an annual trip every year ,5,2019-03-18
1206,Disney’s disappointing disability situation,i m sad that disneyland makes you wait in line for hours to plead your case for why your disabled child should get a disability pass it s unfair in a very cruel way they won t look at your doctors notes you have to explain or beg why your child should be allowed a pass which i kinda get but at the same time find it very discriminatory i don t think they like they way i looked he didn t even listen to me said he didn t understand big words medical terms mean nothing to him he is not a doctor he was beyond rude he was outright mean i picked a disney vacation because they cater to families with disabled children or at least i thought they did we were celebrating my daughters last chemo which is great and all but unfortunately because of months of intense chemo and the high dose steroids to treat blood cancer she has severe osteonecrosis which we can t treat because it requires total joint replacement of her ankles knees and hips which is not possible during treatment so we have to wait until her anc comes back with normal numbers and she is healthy enough to undergo such intense surgery in about months until then she lives in intense pain which is ongoing for over a year osteonecrosis is dead bone my daughters is extremely severe it s an extremely painful condition but that didn t qualify her for a pass but a lady standing next to me her son didn t like loud noises he got a pass i was mind blown i didn t even go seeking this out a cast member an employee of disney told me to go do this to get a das pass after seeing her struggle to stand and wince in pain while meeting tinkerbell the man assessing whether or not my daughter was disabled enough for a pass looked me dead in the eye and asked me why i brought her to disneyland if she was sick and in pain what kind of question in that i thought it was disneyland the happiest place on earth she has at least major upcoming surgeries she has been on treatment for cancer for over two years why wouldn t i bring her to disneyland we could have went there for a make a wish trip but she wished something else she later expressed her desire to have went to disney and i took her on my own make a wish and even though disneyland is actually quite crappy to disabled people i still got to see her smile and light up at seeing the parade the joy on her face was contagious at meeting tinkerbell all in i m glad she got to complete her dream of going to disneyland she could only do about hours a day on a day pass but it s whatever we came and saw we rode ride a day we wouldn t dream of ever going back and for that i m thankful ,2,2019-03-18
1207,Mini Magic Kingdom,i took my year old daughter to disneyland and this was the first park she has gone it was good but i was expecting more after being visited the magic kingdom in orlando which is a better park for me disneyland is smaller so you can go easily over the whole park in one day but the lines were huge it has almost the same rides you have in orlando and we had so much fun here if you live closer to disneyland the visit is totally worth it but if you can choose go to orlando ,4,2019-03-18
1208,Happiest place on earth!, if you can handle the crowds we expected busy and boy was it ever i prefer the wdw prebooking of fastpasses and the magic bands to manage long lines and waits but you can add maxpass if you want to pay for it park is clean and well themed all the cms are friendly and accommodating tried walt s chilli didn t get to ride in the front of the monorail but we tried having park hopper is nice between these two parks as they are so close together a few rides went down a couple times but never for long if it is your first visit and you want to see it all i would say two days at each park that factors in eating shows parades rides and lines ,4,2019-03-17
1209,No longer leading the world,we visited expecting to be blown away however the theme parks of the world are now operating to this standard so it felt familiar rather than outstanding,4,2019-03-17
1210,Terrible employee...once again,cindy is by far the worst employee i have come across in the yrs i have been going to disneyland she was working at the red cart which sells corn dogs she lied to us and was super rude when we found out other people had ordered the exact thing we were trying to which she claimed was not possible seriously disneyland needs to hire nicer people if they are going to advertise disneyland as the happiest place on earth so disappointed in cindy and the way she treated us ,1,2019-03-17
1211,Great family destination,this was my first trip to disneyland there were three adults and one yr old we all enjoyed it we got a three day special you must download the app easiest way to plan rides based on wait times and figure out food also if you get max pass which we did its the best and easiest way to do the fast pass and if you have pictures taken you can see them all on the app the only issue i found was that it can be very difficult here to figure out where the entrance to the rides are this park is smaller than disneyworld and a lot is crammed in and at times the sheer volume of people makes it tough also some of the lines are very narrow which is challenging with a toddler our fave rides were indiana jones must fastpass the roller coaster in toon town and all the rides in tomorrowland the third day we saw a lot of characters but the other two days they were sparse take snacks and water in with you and save your for a dole whip and a churro best value to eat is red rose tavern massive and yummy breakfast until am oh and every kid will want the bubble wand it s but worth it get your ears lanyards and character autograph books on amazon way cheaper and just the same definitely do a character dining it is pricey but its a buffet the food is great and the characters do an amazing job be sure to make a reservation ,4,2019-03-17
1212,It keeps getting better!,first of all i have to mention that i always use a crowd predictor calendar to plan my visits and will not go to the park when the crowds are expected to be high because it s not fun waiting in line all day my family prefers to wait less than minutes for rides this is doable if you go on a slow day and utilize fast passes and single rider lines we last visited in march close to spring break and the lines were a bit longer than we usually like but went anyway since we were meeting friends the line for the matterhorn was min but i was able to ride it twice in minutes thanks to the single rider line disney has stepped up their food game lately and it shows the food and wine festival at dca is nothing compared to what is offered at epcot in florida but it s nice trying different items the new tropical hideaway next to the tiki room is very well done and the treats are excellent i appreciate seeing more vegetarian and vegan options throughout the park i would love to see disney stop using artificial food colors in their foods more organic options would be nice ,5,2019-03-17
1213,"Lots to do, download the app to be well-informed",my husband and i went to disneyland together with a day park hopper for both the magic kingdom and california adventures this was a perfect amount of time for us to see all our nostalgic favorites and check out the new fun stuff in california adventures i loved the incredicoaster and since we did it early in the day we got a fastpass that was ready for about minutes after we got there i strongly recommend getting the app so you can know what wait times are ,4,2019-03-16
1214,Disneyland,i would say california adventures was much better i was a little disappointed in disneyland my family didn t get to see any characters i cant complain that it was too packed because it was disneyland but the overall experience wasn t very good i was hoping to get pictures with all of the characters with my daughter but didn t see not ,5,2019-03-16
1215,No need to return.,grew up going to dl as i lived about hours away moved about years ago and decided to go back that won t happen again the fastpass system is ridiculous why can t they catch up to dw why should you only book one at a time once in the park we were able to go on rides three every single other ride we tried shut down every one haunted mansion shut as we walked up indiana jones while we were in line what a mess just told everyone to leave we were all the way up ready to load and all those people trying to back track out that tiny cave hallway wouldn t let anyone use the emergency exits was a madhouse small world min wait then shut down after we were in for we were able to go on bobsleds star tours and buzz lightyear after pirates shut when we were in line for min we gave up and left too many people not enough to do not the disneyland i remember as a kid thats for sure ,3,2019-03-16
1216,Getting a bit more magical in the magic kingdom.,had a great time with the kids this year disney is working on major improvements the castle was closed for remodeling and paint so many improvements are underway and have been implemented lots of little surprises on even the classic rides if you are a disney park fan you will notice the changes ,5,2019-03-16
1217,Best site of Disneyland Anaheim,we prefer this site more than california adventure even if california had more teenager adult rides the only problem we had difficulty to access free wi fi our phone didn t had internet access so it was hard to get our fastpass we had need to take our fastpass at the booth but we really appreciated our time in this site ,4,2019-03-16
1218,"Amazing Disneyland, at a price",disneyland park is truly an amazing attraction the original in anaheim must rightly be on many people s bucket lists the park environment and staff makes it such a friendly and fun experience however there were so many people in the park it was quite crowded and the overall cost of the day is very high as are most of the foodstuffs and drinks so on entertainment alone it s perfect but overcrowding and overall cost takes the shine off a little ,4,2019-03-16
1219,Always a great time,went here as a young boy and always seems to get better the rides are fabulous still love the matterhorn pirates of the carribean is still a favorite the submarine ride is a bit dated but still fun autotopia and tomorrowland are wonderful best exhibit is still meet mr lincoln be sure to take a train ride around the park ,5,2019-03-15
1220,Birthday celebration,as always it was a great visit to the disneyland park it was very crowded but for us being in the park at opening the lines for rides were not as long and sometimes it was a walk on using the magic morning also was a good idea for shorter lines as well as having a plan on what rides and where helps navigating the park ,5,2019-03-15
1221,Excitement,i took my grandsons and they had so much fun they are still talking about it just make sure the kids are at least inches for most adventurous rides ,5,2019-03-15
1222,Use the Disneyland app!,disneyland is still fun after all these years if you show up with the right attitude and a willing to wait periodically during the day the smartphone app is extremely useful for getting some of your advanced passes and to find wait time at a touch the fireworks show is one of my favorites and best enjoyed from within the park actually all the shows are worth attending ,4,2019-03-14
1223,Deeply disappointing,overcrowded long lines for everything from rides to restaurants to restrooms broken down rides insufficient seating areas few characters walking around and little disney magic to be found this trip felt like a total money grab with very little in return ,2,2019-03-14
1224,Crowd was not too bad and not as many disgruntled people,having been to disney world magic kingdom in florida and had a not so happy time we decided to give disneyland park a shot the florida trip was in the middle of the summer so it may not have been the best time to go we went to disneyland at the end of february during nh school vacation week we bought day hopper passes so that we could also enjoy disney california adventure our first day was on a monday and the park opened at am we arrived at the security gates at about am and there was already a pretty good size line security will check your bags and you need to go through a metal detector you are allowed to bring in food and drink within reason after getting through security you then need to get into another line to enter the park the security line is for both parks we did get into the park and it was only about a minute travel time through security and the front gate this was on a day when the crowd level website predicted a out of the park was pretty full so we wandered around to get a feel for the park this was until we got into tomorrowland and there was no line for the buzz light year ride so we went on that we went on twice as there was not a line when we came out we then went right across the way and got on the star tours ride star wars ride as we kept roaming around the park the ride times started to get higher and higher but still not as bad as in florida we were able to get on most of the rides with less than a minute wait this included the big rides like matterhorn big thunder mountain and the jungle cruise haunted mansion and indian jones overall we had a great day at disneyland it appeared that there were not as many disgruntled people in california but this could be due to time of year temperature parking did not seem to be an issue in disneyland as a lot of people walked into the park or had the bus drop them off out in front even though the park is not as big there are lots of things to do shopping dining and the parade to finish off the day is really entertaining on a side note it was extra day to get fast pass if you wanted it we did not use it and were able to get on all the rides ,4,2019-03-13
1225,Smaller but With Charm,having grown up on the east coast with family in florida wdw was always our go to destination but we finally decided to make the trip out to california we did the park in one day and went at the end of august when ap holders were able to return after blackout days we stayed off property but walking distance and the hotel had a great shuttle and pretty much went open to close and felt that the park could be done for the most part in one day the first thing is that sleeping beauty s castle is just so much smaller than cinderella s but i think that is part of the charm as well it s great to be able to experience the park that walt actually walked through and saw open knowing the history behind the park gives such a larger appreciation to the park itself the park itself is smaller then magic kingdom but is set up similarly making it very easy to navigate we were able to ride everything we wanted to including trips on space mountain and rides on star tours for the brothers i will say that the pirates of the caribbean far exceeds the one in florida we loved it my mom also though the thunder railroad was better but thought space mountain was better in florida it was interesting to be able to compare the two parks that had similar rides while appreciating the unique rides like indiana jones having the app and pulling fast passes is absolutely the key to success we also did enjoy not having to take a monorail ferry from the park to the car and then the car back to the hotel it makes for a painful end of the night when leaving magic kingdom in florida in california we felt we could sit and watch the fireworks and then just walk out of the gates it was amazing we also walked off site for dinner at a denny s with a minute walk from the park for a quick break from the action we did dca and disneyland back to back open to close i really wanted to give stars but the system doesn t allow for that i was so so so excited to finally ride the matterhorn i know so ridiculous since everyone says it is a rickety rough ride but you can blame the disneyland sing a long vhs my parents got me when i was younger and my disappointment in realizing that ride is not in florida once we finally got there and don t know when i ll be back in the area the haunted mansion one of my moms favorites also was down for the halloween overlay to happen and it went down the day before we got to the parks having two major attractions down was a bit of a bummer when we were there and probably contributed to the multiple rides in tomorrowland coming in august i didn t expect this to happen we also loved fantasmic however not having seating and a roped off area did make seeing it hard with tall people and parents holding their children even with pulling the fastpass for it ,4,2019-03-13
1226,Fun week!,my family of did disneyland for days and california adventure we had a great time and glad we did that many days the crowds were large and we didn t feel rushed that way there were some rides and attractions closed for refurbishment but that s what we get for going in the off season can t say much more about this place it s well run and almost all the staff are great we only saw one grumpy guy running a ride ,5,2019-03-12
1227,The happiest place on earth,we went here without young children loved the rides the turkey leg lunch and especially fastpass it s nicer than orlando to the extent it is more compact the lines are definitely shorter and it is an easy in and out,5,2019-03-12
1228,Make it count,are you at the park for maximum efficiency riding all the rides or are you here for the experience either way you need the disneyland app it has enhanced our trip and experiences you gotta let go and let disney i promise they know what they re doing ,5,2019-03-11
1229,Thank you Mickey and friends!!!!,my wife and i planned this trip a few months ago and he hesitated a bit about it because our baby girl is just months all it didn t matter her smile worth every single second of this trip it s a really magic place and i cannot be happier ,5,2019-03-11
1230,Beautiful Nostalgia,what an amazing experience having visited disney world times over the last years we were nervous to visit disneyland we bit the bullet and decided to plan a day trip to disneyland on the way to disney s aulani it was fantastic our only regret is that we didn t plan enough days in disneyland i know that people say you can do both parks in days but that s just not possible the entertainment in disneyland is captivating there are so many can t miss shows some of the rides like the incredicoaster are amazing and riding it just one time would be a shame there were many things we didn t have the time to experience while walt disney world is still our favorite i cannot wait to return to disneyland ,5,2019-03-10
1231,Love Disneyland!,it just doesn t get any better than disneyland this is the best time of year to go the lines weren t bad and the weather was fantastic the park is always clean and amazing it always has such a great feeling there thanks disneyland ,5,2019-03-10
1232,Amazing (just not as magical as in Orlando),so we arrived months ahead of the opening of star wars galaxy s edge of well we ll be back but our highlights were meeting chewbacca rey and kylo ren as well as an imperial stormtrooper too the evil witch from snow white who met us in one of the buildings on the right down main street was perfectly in character what a wonderful memory another highlight was pirates of the caribbean longer and more fun than its likeness in orlando we had to go twice same for it s a small world it s longer and more intricate than in walt disney world and great for all ages our last day it poured rain but we still had a blast ,5,2019-03-10
1233,Best place for family vacation,just spend days open to close at disneyland how can you go wrong visiting disney wife and daughter already wanting to go again star wars lane opening later this year ,5,2019-03-10
1234,Enjoyable Experience for the Children,arrived just after opening my children enjoyed their day out but since they have already been to hong kong disneyland a number of times they tended to get a little bored as it is very similar in fact we left after or hours where we stayed the full time the disney adventure park was open still enjoyed our experience though ,4,2019-03-10
1235,Happy Place...but Orlando is Happier!,disneyland very clean well kept restaurants were decent but the friendliness of some of the staff surprisingly was not even close to orlando interesting enough the hotels on site definitely were not as friendly as disney hotels in orlando nor did it match up to friendliness and wow factors like disney cruises some of the disneyland sites need some updating and more wow added to them when one goes to orlando disney world cinderella s castle and surrounding have that wow factor disneyland looks in places dated disneyland s weather sure beats disney world s s but for the rest well ,4,2019-03-09
1236,Charming,i grew up in orlando so i have spent a lot of time going to disney world honestly i was looking to hate on disneyland but i ended up finding it very charming the lines were not as long and it did not feel like i was standing on the surface of the sun like it does in orlando disneyland is much smaller than disney world but has many of the same lands and rides as disney world the fact that it is setup the same as disney world made it easy to navigate but everything was a lot easier to get to it was also interesting to see slight differences in some of my favorite rides like pirates of the caribbean and the haunted mansion i think pirates is actually better at disneyland and it has a restaurant overlooking it the haunted mansion is more setup like a louisiana mansion which somehow made it creepier even if the ride was almost identical there are also many rides that i have never seen so that was a lot of fun also the food seemed to be better we ate at a mexican place and it was really good ,4,2019-03-09
1237,PERFECT for Ages 2-5!,our grand babes had the time of their little lives and were much less overwhelmed than if we had gone to orlando i recommend using pinterest to gather ideas for a family vacation in addition to trip advisor the park was clean and the staff was very fun and courteous with the exception of one of the security guards as we were going through security on the disneyland hotel side joke is on his snotty self we still loved our disney vacation ,5,2019-03-09
1238,Crowds and rides that need to be updated,disney has a difficult time as it has to cater to traditionalists but attract new attendees at very high prices don t know why anyone goes on autotopia not sure about the submarines as we didn t bother pirates jungle cruise and haunted mansion are stuck in a time warp if you went on these rides years ago very little has changed the little kid rides are also unchanged but that is fine as dumbo and small world are classics i m sure that star wars land will be awesome but i won t be going back until my grandaughters next trip in a few years ,4,2019-03-09
1239,Family Vacay!,went to disneyland for my baby nieces birthday had so much fun i only had issues the first was that some of the rides we wanted to go on was closed for renovations including snow whites castle and that through out the park it smelt like sewage ,4,2019-03-09
1240,Never gets old,our th time at disneyland anaheim my wife and i have been fortunate to visit every disneyland park on the planet and when asked which is our favourite we always reply anaheim the original it s called the magic kingdom and i can see why ,5,2019-03-08
1241,Disneyland in the rain,first time visit we went to disneyland park for one day while in los angles not nearly enough time to see the entire park rain was persistent on and off all day however i was surprised that guests and cast members still made it the happiest place on earth with hundreds of people going in the interior areas tile floors were wet with rain water we did not have any trouble walking nor did i see anybody slip employees kept puddling to a minimum with brooms one advantage is that most of the lines were reasonably short in hindsight we should have taken the disney train around the perimeter of the park to get a idea of all the sections a return visit is a must for us with a few more days set aside so we can visit both parks ,5,2019-03-07
1242,couples disney trip,went there on thinking it would not be too crowded boy was i ever wrong as an annual member i signed up years ago for their least expensive package in the beginning it was great but the last couple of years the place has been getting too crowded no matter what day we go i don t know if i will be renewing my pass this year ,3,2019-03-07
1243,Come all the time,i try to come to the park once a month i know the big bad prices get pretty high but if you live close by getting your pass in monthly payments is a lot easier i think everyone should ,5,2019-03-07
1244,Great fun!,having visited disneyworld in florida several times we were delighted to find lots of fun here in california too while much smaller a footprint there is so much to do and see in a more manageable way in march temps were cool and a bit rainy making wait times on the ride no longer than ten minutes we really liked the max pass feature which frankly is better than florida s magic bands the rides are all fun the food and lots of it is very delicious we loved being able to walk to our hotel too ,5,2019-03-07
1245,Great Birthday Celebration,we went to disney for our daughter s th birthday we had a great time they have her a button stating we were celebrating her birthday and she received birthday wishes all day max pass is the way to go it let us skip the long lines i can say a couple of the rides need some sprucing up overall it was such a great trip i m already planning our next trip ,5,2019-03-06
1246,Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services,we have been coming to disneyland resort for years and big fans my year old granddaughter has a severe hearing loss but knows about signs my wife did research and found that they do frozen with a sign language interpreter at some shows we checked with guest services at the entrance and they told us it was on friday at the noon show they also told us that mickey and the magical map also had interpreter services on monday at noon while at the mickey show we met to if the interpreters and learned how to access the weekly schedule of all the shows and parades that they do if you google interpreters disneyland you will find a link to disney s website go to the dhh link and embedded in the synopsis is a calendar link to download the weekly schedule they offer the services friday through monday they have special areas for parades and shows the plus side is you don t have to show up hours early for a parade the downside is that it is not a premium view but not bad considering the other surprise on the schedule is that also do some of the rides as well including jungle cruise story book etc the cast members are excellent and enthusiastic in their roles we were most surprised that this service has been around since it is just not promoted by disneyland in fact at various rides and at city hall they were either unaware of the service when it was offered and generally gave contradictory information it was the two cast members that we met at mickey s magical map that we learned about everything that they offer i highly recommend that if you or anyone in your party can utilize this service that you find the schedule and use it to your advantage to provide a much more enriched experience ,5,2019-03-06
1247,Always something new at Disneyland...,we go every few years and have never been to disappointed prices are getting up there and food is getting better in the park i was disappointed when i heard they control the wait times of all rides meaning if one ride doesn t have much of a line they have ways to slow it down all in an effect to control the crowds still a fun place to visit with family friends ,5,2019-03-06
1248,I love going to Disney Parks.,disneyland is such a great place for kids there are so many attractions and a large variety of rides the food does cost a bit and there are a lot of people around but it s worth a day of lots of enjoment and fun i love how the park is divided into its own categories and sections which gives the rides a large variety bring water on hot days ,5,2019-03-05
1249,LOVE DISNEY,i love all things disney the park is very clean you ll pay a lot for food and drinks in the park so either be ready for a ok lunch or pack some food with you ,5,2019-03-05
1250,Fun,we went on a monday tons of people but we had a lot of fun so many things to do just wish it wasnt so expensive wide variety of rides and entertainment for everyone tons of food choices too ,4,2019-03-04
1251,So much calmer than DisneyWorld,we had the opportunity to visit disneyland with our grandkids while traveling in the west being a veteran lover and frequent visitor of disneyworld in florida i was very impressed with how much easier this park was to navigate the july weather was perfect and we were able to ride everything that we wanted to ride ,5,2019-03-04
1252,Band Trip to Disney,trip with high school students all had a blast had my service dog with me in my wheelchair as always very accommodating in my chair tried a kennel at one of the rides for the first time and she didn t like it barked during the ride which prompted a visit from park security a little heavy handed in talking to me but respectful we just did swaps for any ride she couldn t do the rest of the day fun souvenirs too ,5,2019-03-03
1253,The Happiest Place on Earth!,be patient take lots of cash lots of photos and use max pass know ahead of times its pricey and plan accordingly i love disneyland ,5,2019-03-03
1254,Fun place to visit,i have now visited twice and it never gets old always a fun adventure with the family i hope to take my grand children there one day ,5,2019-03-03
1255,Love this place as much as I love Donald and Mickey plus Goofey,since i have visited this park most of my live and lucky me it cost once upon a time i always enjoyed all the adventure spots and the splash mountain and matterhorn ride also indiana jones you will decide once there bring money and energy ,5,2019-03-03
1256,Happiest Place on Earth!,not much needs to be said the place is magical disney does an amazing job always making you want to come back one thing that i i always notice compacted to other theme parks is disneyland is always clean other theme parks have trash all over the place bathrooms are always dirty you step on pieces of gum and things need to be cleaned not at disney i ve seen popcorn fall and people drop their churro wrappers and a disney staff member picks it up seconds later just awesome,5,2019-03-03
1257,Happiest Place on Earth,love all the security makes us feel safe always enjoy the park during off season the lines were tolerable cast members are always helpful and we learn something new every trip this time we learned the perfume shop in new orleans square suffered water damage years ago and the damaged mirror was never repaired replaced beautiful shop the painted mirrors are gorgeous and the shop is quite special ,5,2019-03-03
1258,Not a Good Time to Attend,many rides were closed for maintenance then other rides shut down while waiting in line couldn t even use the fastpass for one of them indiana jones because it never re opened had to return to thunder mountain after already waiting an hour before it broke down the first time was able to use the fastpass from indy to shorten the wait when we returned the main iconic castle you see in the pictures is covered with some sort of canvas that has a picture of the castle instead not worth the few rides we were able to go on for each ,2,2019-03-03
1259,Disneyland Fan,have been a fan since changing our trip to week days really helps with crowds and wait times always have a magical time ,5,2019-03-03
1260,"What Can You Say About ""The Happiest Place On Earth""",we had visited disneyland with our children in when california adventure park was a parking lot so we were raring to explore with our grandchildren in we started planning our trip in july so spent a great deal of time researching the parks and the area very overwhelming but so glad we did the research probably should have spent more time researching parking we purchased day park hopper tickets with max passes taking advantage of the well advertised canadian resident deal and in february escaped the polar vortex in alberta canada and headed to lax the weather was cooler than expected but our house rental and the heated outside pool and hot tub always warmed us up and a rain coat or poncho was packed i had also rolled my pack jacket up and put it in my backpack great idea the parks are overwhelming and you really need some kind of a plan the first day you arrive for us the mornings were too cool to make use of our early morning entry that we paid for so we often arrived around after having a morning swim and good breakfast unfortunately the disney business has not put any upgrades into to it s security system which is very archaic and chaotic kind of seems like a make work project actually a joke as some random person persons dig through each bag with a flashlight the security experience was a very frustrating start to what became great days yes the park is expensive but almost every visitor is wearing some kind of disney gear we had hoped that february would be a less than busy month to visit but in retrospect will choose for weather rather than crowds next time can not imagine the busy season restaurants always had wait times from to minutes so if you are planning on eating in the park that you plan your seating time around a close ride or gift shop we did eat at a couple of on site sit down restaurants and the service was always friendly and great the food was ok but the bill was always grand and us dollars so extra grand for us perhaps the prices are somewhat inflated to compensate for the the no alcoholic beverages sold in the park policy our grandchildren are ages and and their heights allowed them to experience all of the rides the kid in them loved mickey s toontown but not the haunted mansion or the matterhorn bobsleds which were a little scary for them but indiana jones thunder mountain railroad and splash mountain were big hits be prepared to get wet on splash mountain they sell towels at the exit of the ride we of course took them to places we remembered from like pirates of the caribbean the jungle cruise and the enchanted tiki room also hits who doesn t enjoy a leisurely ride through it s a small world the parades throughout the day were enjoyable and a must see at least once the light and fireworks show will be remembered we grabbed a late supper at the carnation cafe our first evening and it was the perfect setting for the fireworks show on our second visit to disney we parked in the simba parking lot and after clearing security jumped on the monorail which took us directly to tomorrowland smoothest park entry we had the first day we did comment how few disney characters we saw they only seemed to be in the parade but on our second visit we saw some unfortunately the lines for photos were always long and quite often it seemed like it would almost be your turn and the character would head off to a new location oops another missed opportunity perhaps if the kids had had the first visit button we saw a few times they may have been given the once in a lifetime opportunity pluto just happened to be at the back door of the camera shop in toontown on one visit snap got it be prepared to walk for hours grab a warm churrio or pretzel splurge on a funnel cake we shared one and maybe grab a dole whip the kids each had their own money to spend in the gift shops which was a great idea as they may have wanted everything if they were spending some else s money but took great pride in their shopping experience downtown disney is actually just outside the two park entrances but inside the security area it is filled with shopping restaurants and entertainment it is accessed without a park entry ticket so is busy not only with park goers but anyone who cares to visit downtown disney super busy and almost impossible to get a reservation at any of the restaurants the saving grace a the end of our day and as we left the park was a warm coffee from starbucks i journaled our themepark visit and read it to the kids the other day they are still smiling ,5,2019-03-03
1261,An amazing place to visit even without kids!,have been to disneyland a few times and it has never let us down we are a couple and visit with park without kids it is just as good for adults the attention to detail never ceases to amaze us and every employee in the park is there to help you whenever you need it does get insanely busy and can be an expensive day out but a little bit of preplanning before you go will go along way make sure to download the disneyland app before you go to get an idea of ride wait times and we always bring a packed lunch and snacks with us so keep the food costs down make sure you plan in at least one parade the floats and costumes are amazing and you will get a lot of character sightings in one place it can be done as a day trip from la but it will be a long day so be prepared you can get the from downtown la straight to disney but it does take hours if you are ok with paying more look into a shuttle bus the best thing to do is get there a bit before opening times and once it opens head straight to the rides which normally have the longest lines they wont be so long first thing in the morning the main tip have a great time and enjoy what the park has to offer ,5,2019-03-02
1262,Disneyland,great park even better than disney world i will be back i m sure a shame some on the rides were broken during our trip ,4,2019-03-02
1263,Truly Amazing,wow had the best time ever really hard to describe how spectacular disneyland is everything is so well done and the staff are super friendly truly is the happiest place on earth ,5,2019-03-02

1266,"Poor weather, but still fun",we managed to hit the coldest and rainiest weather but were able to enjoy some fun walks through disneyland and california adventure the train that goes around the edge of the park is a great way to get around short trips a few times a day seem to work best with young children ,5,2019-03-01
1267,It's magic in here!,what can i say what hasn t been said about disneyland we come here on a yearly basis and every time we leave we look forward for our next vacation it s such a great place to experience with family yes it is pricey but it s worth it sure you can eat elsewhere on the cheap but they they have some great food onsite ,5,2019-03-01
1268,Very good walkable park. We enjoyed it,the nice thing about this park is that it is walkable and can get to the california park if desired the hits were haunted house smallworld star wars launchbay star tours indiana jones,5,2019-03-01
1269,Great 50th Birthday Celebration location,had visited disney years ago alot the same and alot has changed line waits were minimal for this time of year only had to fast pass one ride had a great time for my birthday staff all around were welcoming and happy weather was great zero complaints loved the parade and the light show ,5,2019-03-01
1270,Legend of fun for kids and adults-planning helps,this was our first trip to disneyland after many trips to dw it did not disappoint at all with slightly less crowds than florida for this time of year the fast pass system is annoying and requires planning if you have a limited time window and want to get a lot in our kids loved it though and the princesses were amazing in how they made my youngest feel so incredibly special ,5,2019-02-28
1271,Not what I remember.,i love disneyland i was so excited to be able to get to take my son here when i went the first time i was in awe and everything was fun and magical i was just like a big kid well this time i saw it a little differently it was so crowded that it was hard to get around sometimes the lines were always really long some of the rides kept experiencing technical difficulties etc we eventually just did the single riders line to avoid the hour waits the rides weren t as good as i remembered however in saying that i feel this park is geared more towards the younger ages still love the place though huge disappointment though was that the castle was under refurbishment so my son never got to see what it looked like at nighttime i would say definitely get here early and absolutely take advantage of the fastpass option ,4,2019-02-28
1272,Great first visit for grandkids!,we took our and year old grandkids to disney for he day and they absolutely loved it it was a bit rainy which helped keep the crowd down but did nothing to dampen our fun the only downside was the new entry process with extremely long lines to get through security outside the park gates we had two strollers and multiple bags along with thousands of others and waited nearly an hour after initial arrival to actually enter the park plan accordingly my granddaughter loved her princess makeover at the boutique in the castle and really loved meeting the princesses who did a great job of interacting with her while remaining in character great visit highly recommend taking the kids when they are in the year age range ,4,2019-02-28
1273,Simply Amazing,i don t like disneyland said no one ever it s just the best place to recapture your youth and forget all your troubles i try to go at least x year more if i can afford it ,5,2019-02-27
1274,Disappointment Land. Not DisneyLand,broken down rides unhappy employees dirty definitely not the most magical place on earth i will go to disney orlando again in a minute as we ve been there many times the girls wanted to try something new so we went to california disney instead so disappointed snow white ride malfunctioned and my husband was hit with the cart employee didn t even care just picked up his back pack that was dropped in the process and handed it to him the ride was closed down due to him being hit though none of us ever have the want to return to disneyland again ,2,2019-02-27
1275,Not a fan of the Land!,we recently went to balboa island on vacation with the family we also have never been to california but figured since we were so close that visiting disneyland was a must we went in february which was off season and everything was just okay it was so overcrowded even being offseason i can t imagine what the busy season looks like or how you could even function everyone is packed together and the park is pretty outdated and it shows for the amount of money disney brings in and charges they should be ashamed of the condition of the park just slapping new paint on old rides and giving it a new name i know its a type of marketing and branding but the park size is just way to small for the amount of people to go in there people are rude my daughter and wife got puked on by some guy getting off a ride at the park ive also been to disney world as we are from the east coast if you are reading this based on choosing go there its the same cooperate structure but it is far larger and superior as parks go if i had a choice now i would have gone to knox berry farms instead ,2,2019-02-27
1276,Disappointing not as good as other Disney’s,disney to us as a family is usually magic we have been to florida with the children for years and have also been to paris but what a disappointment firstly it took over hour to get through a bag check then to wait in yet another line to get into disney finally we arrived to look at the castle it was covered in what looked like cardboard there had been no warnings on their website to a refurbishment awful and it was almost laughable the fast pass worked but was rarely checked and many people walked through fast pass queues without tickets and was not checked which made it a joke this was not the disney i was looking for ,3,2019-02-27
1277,A legendary Disney experience!!,if you love disney and even if you don t when you come to la you should visit disneyland it is magical i wasn t really interested doing it for my kids but i got into it had a fabulous time went on many more rides than i expected to get the fast pass more expensive yes but saves you so much time priceless ,5,2019-02-27
1278,Fun First Experience,my family is a wdw family due to living on the east coast we decided to try disneyland park for the first time during our mid winter break the crowds were not as bad as we expected we did pay for the maxpass which i feel is a must here the maxpass grants you photos and fast pass options there were pros and cons to the fast pass system for me the fp only allows you to select an attraction once you enter the park trust me it knows when you have entered once you select your first fp you can not select another until you either use cancel the first or you wait two hours a selection can be made every hours unless you are in the park first thing in the am popular rides will only have fps late afternoon or early evening to start my suggestion is to get there early enough or grab the most important and find something to do for two hours until the next opportunity i like that this gives an opportunity to all guests at a fair rate however the wait time is a bit much we ended up experiencing several rides by entering the stand by line while waiting until our fp for another ride we loved that the characters interact out in the public with everyone and that you are not always forced in an outrageous line to see them each character really gave you a welcoming feel which i feel has been lost a bit in orlando florida i was upset that the castle was draped with tarps that had a picture of a castle it was not noted online until we arrived that it was not available some rides that showed as down for refurbishment online were actually open there is no dining plan as orlando has so snacks beverages and meals are out of pocket that was a damper especially when it was only myself and my daughter i paid usd for a souvenir cup filled with a slushee outrageous thank goodness for our club level room at disneyland hotel where we could walk back to for a mid afternoon snack if we wanted ,4,2019-02-26
1279,Magical place. Do not forego FastPasses!,we went during a busy week and the fastpasses were our ticket to fun can t imagine doing the park on a busy day without them we had soooo much fun disneyland is truly one of a kind and they do an amazing job in every aspect clean friendly fun even when the lines are long it s a wonderful way to spend a few days thanks for the memories ,5,2019-02-25
1280,Service has gone downhill,i visited disneyland about years ago and thought it was amazing truly was the happiest on earth visited again this week and was very disappointed the characters are fantastic but the rest of the staff were definitely not happy very poor customer service wherever we went whether it was ride operators or staff in the restaurants it was my partners birthday while we were in the park and they got more birthday wishes from other guests than staff will not be visiting again universal is much friendlier and we had a much more enjoyable experience ,2,2019-02-25
1281,Disney magic,i mean it s disneyland it s amazing love the maxpass system super helpful in gathering photos and not running all over the place to grab fastpasses ,5,2019-02-25
1282,Great Place,we had the magic hour and since it was raining it was great and not that busy if it was busier i would recommend fast pass for sure ,5,2019-02-25
1283,Great day out,i had bought a one day park hopper pass and went to disneyland second because i ve been here before i went on a tuesday and there were a lot of people but i didn t have to wait overly long to get on the rides my first stop is always star tours and i ll definitely have to come back when the new star wars area opens up i used the fastpass for space mountain but i didn t really need to because i found the single rider lane after i got off the first time and went around and got straight back on i also used the single rider lane for splash mountain the only ride i didn t get on was the matterhorn bobsleds because there was a mechanical issue with the fastpass i was disappointed that you can only choose ride at a time and then had to wait mins to make the next selection having the photos with the maxpass was great the christmas decorations were up and the they look fantastic at night i also came on the local bus from los angeles and it was a cheaper way to get to disneyland and see the city rather than just the freeways ,5,2019-02-24
1284,Great time with Granddaughter,what a wonderful magical place to bring kids of all ages never disappoints brought our three grandchildren and they all loved it including us big kids ,5,2019-02-24
1285,the original theme park,amazing destination for any disney fan this is where it all started you ll experience all of the sights and smells of main street sleeping beauty s castle space mountain pirates of the caribbean the tiki room and more ,5,2019-02-24
1286,Fantastic Disney Experience !,what s not to like about disney parks the disneyland park is the main park in anaheim sitting opposite from it s partner disney california adventure park and is definitely the better of the two as with other sites disneyland is divided into a number of themed zones radiating out from the central sleeping beauty castle these zones include adventureland new orleans square critter county frontierland fantasyland mickey s toontown tomorrowland and the soon to be completed star wars galaxy s edge summer home to many of disney s iconic rides such as the original it s a small world space mountain splash mountain big thunder mountain railroad and matterhorn bobsleds this park should not be missed ,5,2019-02-24
1287,cool in February but fun,they were taking down the covering on the castle just before we left so that wasn t so great didn t realize how much the sight of the castle enhances the visit but it was amazing as always,4,2019-02-24
1288,Military- Get the 3 day pass if u have time,so glad we waited to purchase at the park there was no line for tickets the clerk was extremely helpful explaining our options and saved us probably or more adults children days was not enough time lines were long if you have young children the just go to the old disney right side after security we paid for parking each day per vehicle and rode the free shuttle worth it so much walking during the day i have bad knees i thought the park could use a little more outside seating did not see any security but it must have been there as everyone left their strollers unattended bring an extra bag or backpack food example burger fries single turkey leg so recommend pack a lunch saw no drinking fountains so bring water but its heavy we went days with over and year old i would have liked to have seen an information center or more signs in the park on where you were and what direction attractions were easy yo get turned around bathrooms always had paper and paper towels very clean and well maintained ,3,2019-02-24
1289,Special!,there is definitely something special about this park compared to all the other disney parks around the world even though it is quite small lots of amazing rides history the cm are helpful crowds can be large but it is well managed the food is some of the best that i have had in a disney park the disneyland app is very useful and even though we did not pay for the max pass we were able to get fastpasses for all the rides we wanted ,5,2019-02-23
1290,First time in many years,was not thrilled with the long wait for the bag check but understand they importance of keeping people safe once inside the park it was great and my family enjoyed our time ,5,2019-02-23
1291,All time Fav,disneyland is an all time favorite hardly any thing changes from the time we were kids best time to go is when weather is cooler,5,2019-02-23
1292,This is an Institution,disney does not disappoint allow at least a full day in each park and invest in fast pass to avoid standing in the long lines that are always present at the more popular attractions rides something to do for everyone young and old just go and have fun ,5,2019-02-23
1293,Grandkids loved the park.,took my family and grandkids to disneyland for many this was their first time in disneyland it is very clean and well organized our granddaughter had her th birthday when we were there and wore a button stating it was her birthday so many staff and characters recognized her birthday which she really enjoyed and will remember forever we found rides to be excellent and staff were very accommodating use of fast pass on rides worked well only complaint is that we were only allowed to visit one park per day as per our ticket we were able to take in food and drinks for the young kids which helped keep the expense down ,4,2019-02-23
1294,Busy,had a fantastic time we had a day pass which was needed as it was very busy even though it was february but it s disney if you go expecting queues you will be fine we found it quicker getting in taking no bags as the line wasn t as long,5,2019-02-22
1295,Must do once,the wife is a disney fanatic so this place was not an option passes were expensive for one day hopper for two people just under us during the weekdays max pass is a must if you intend to do both parks as a couple we managed to do both sides and missed a little bit but overall saw and did what we wanted again maxpass enables us to book a time for another ride while waiting in line for a different ride without this feature and data and the app you need to visit in person each location to obtain a fast pass parks were very clean a few suffered breakdowns during the day but very acceptable service apparently when there is lightning multiple rides no longer operate be sure to check the app weather when you go to see which ones are down the castle is currently under repairs and not visible to the public last thing is we were told the fireworks are fri sat sun only for low season so unfortunately we missed them ,4,2019-02-22
1296,A Classic,i love walking around the park and seeing all that walt created it was busier than i expected but fastpass helped us avoid a lot of lines and keep us on the attractions ,5,2019-02-22
1297,Christmas 2018,our first visit to disneyland did tons of research and made the most of early mornings was there at rd rope drop and was able to use max pass to get my kids on many rides amazing experience ,5,2019-02-22
1298,where dreams don’t come true,if walt disney is currently in a cryogenic chamber above the fire station in disneyland s main street he must be wanting to pull the plug having been a fan and visitor of orlando s walt disney world disneyland was a disappointment most of the staff seems to hate working there it was hard to receive a smile i don t blame them they have recently had disputes with they re salary the park was mostly dirty and the bathrooms in eleven were cleaner that most of the restrooms across the parks about of the rides had issues midway through and they were unannounced closures throughout the day one good thing was the day passes that included maxpass for fast passes and photo pass which were a great value i went in trying to feel like a kid but they brought the adult side of me ,3,2019-02-22
1299,Awesome Day,we had an awesome day so much to see it was pram central lines got rides were too long to wait so we only did the ferris wheel we wanted to do more rides to get our monies worth but you d waste too much time in line disappointing some of the rides were closed and the castle was covered up the parade was awesome good day though ,5,2019-02-22
1300,Wasn't as fun the 3rd time.,maybe i m getting old or maybe i have been too many times but this time lacked the luster from before no real changes or improvements same as years ago it did however do a good job of lifting our spirits and lighten our hearts ,4,2019-02-21
1301,Definitely NOT “The Happiest Place on Earth”,oh my gosh where do i even begin we drove to la from northern alberta canada we decided to take our three teen preteen children what an awful experience from the grumpy parking man we parked preferred man at the ticket office implying that maybe the max pass add on was too expensive for us to the even grumpier older blonde haired lady wearing black tuque named cheryl scanning tickets and taking photos it was awful the castle is under construction so there s a tarp with a cartoon picture of the castle definitely not the same everything in the park is way overpriced unless you re a season pass holder most of the rides were down today feb th and some breaking down and the ride operators were so rude when letting us know that the ride was shut down seemed like they hated their job and i noticed all of the negativity and so did my children we rode rides and decided that enough was enough we left in the worst mood and what a waste of money we spent usd which was close to cad for hours the staff needs a reality check and learn some workplace positivity especially when you work at disneyland ,1,2019-02-21
1302,Best Place On Earth,just the best place for family fun bring your wallet book your max passes be prepared to do a lot of walking but you will have the best time ever recommend minimum day park hopper ride with max pass,5,2019-02-20
1303,Very fun,lots to do here that isn t in florida carsland was fun pixar pier only recycles midway mania from what i could see some old fashioned rides like symphony swings jellyfish and golden zephyr the huge rollercoaster was great i was told by my kids be forewarned that the line for the ferris wheel as you are facing it from the pier has two sides the right line is for moving cars the left is for stationary cars went to the right and hated the swinging kids loved that too soaring ride is same as florida the bakery tour was cool and ghirardelli chocolate store had sales ariel ride is same as florida check the schedules online it was lunar new year celebration and very cool the way everything was themed use fast passes lines are terrible otherwise ,5,2019-02-20
1304,Great Apps to find Shortest Lines,an hour day wow the kids were as happy leaving as they were arriving we had a character breakfast to start the morning kids and adults had a wonderful breakfast loads of fun used the app to figure out which rides had the shortest lines worked wonderful well also used the fast pass perfect ,4,2019-02-20
1305,Great fun,i have been toallthe florida parks i enjoyed disneyland more it is smaller yet we got to more rides it condenses the magic with some of the rides at epcot and mgm plus it is atthe same entrance than the other park and downtown disney so it is all there ,5,2019-02-20
1306,"Loved Disney and CA in Feb, some attractions closed though",disneyland is still really awesome for me ever since we went as children in the s the experience and variety you get cannot be emulated by anyone else round the world the two parks were pretty busy in the february weekend we went tips we bought a special offer days for the price of two pass for effectively per day we also bought a max pass additional pp which helps hugely as you can book fast passes on your smartphone the first fast pass you can book is after you enter the park so everyone has to get up and go through the entrance then you can start booking further passes hours after the initial one the photo offer with the max pass is tremendous as the photographers are really great and you get to have all your photos sent to your smart phone i ve posted a photo of us where the disney photographer photobombed our photo with my minnie mouse soft toy i had bought sooo cool you could also go in the single riders lane which we found we only had to wait minutes at the california adventure roller coaster ride check the disney site as many attractions were not running just so you can manage expectations significant attractions not running when we were here were world of colour ca expected to open up again in november bugs world fantasmic night show splash mountain sleeping beauty castle was being renovated there was plenty to do but make sure you check the fireworks schedule too as in the off season that doesn t run mid week i noticed i would highly recommend the frozen show which is an hour long at california adventure park that s a world class disney musical especially suitable for the girls and ladies i felt we really got our money s worth on the ticket by attending that show all in all another enjoyable time at disney have fun ,5,2019-02-20
1307,Most magical place on Earth!,this was a trip that i wanted to do all of my life disneyland was very fun and the lines were not too long granted it rained the day i was there mr toad s adventure is fantastic and i recommend going on more than once if possible this was one of my favourite stories as a child also highly recommend the rose tavern delicious food and cozy interior ,5,2019-02-20
1308,Always a perfect time!,amazing place to visit with the whole family we visited last week and it was great an overcast day with some rain didn t stop us from having fun we still enjoyed every minute of the park and actually rode almost all the rides the wait time was less than mins which was awesome the churros were delicious and the popcorn was just irresistible had to purchase more that one we will be coming back again ,5,2019-02-20
1309,Great time,we enjoyed the park disappointed that the castle was not real but all in all we had a great time take plenty of money because everything is way over priced ,4,2019-02-20
1310,Happiest Place on Earth!,rainy days make for short waits take advantage of the app to check wait times buy a maxpass for one person in your party to have the park photographers capture your visit ,5,2019-02-19
1311,"Happiest Place on Earth, flow control lacking this time!",disneyland is always magical and this visit did not disappoint the park was clean the rides were updated and fun the employees want to please for the most part our favorite rides we have older kids are space mountain indiana jones thunder mountain pirates star tours and the matterhorn the max pass about extra per person per day really saves time and you can download any pictures taken in the park right to your phone we took pictures at the front of the park in front of the mickey and the photographer was excellent he offered lots of innovative poses that turned out really great the flow control of the park seems to be lacking for example we went on the train and the employees there didn t direct anyone to move down to open up seats for passengers who were scrambling to find one seems like a no brainer but i noticed this lack of crowd control many times through our days at both parks my family loves gibson girl ice cream on main street and the birthday place on main street has a nice chicken dinner that feeds at least two for lunch or dinner we definitely got out money s worth we went on over rides in days all major attractions ,4,2019-02-19
1312,Disneyland with the girls!,my girls and i took a few days and went on a trip to disneyland we had pictures while on a wild water fall ride was the best gift shopping for the ones back home was fun too i highly recommend disneyland to all ages fun fun fun ,5,2019-02-19
1313,Always a great time!,this place gets more fun as my kids get older they are now and and we had the best time this weekend ,5,2019-02-18
1314,February 2019 Visit,the off season is the perfect time to visit disneyland either as adult friends enjoying a vacation like us or as a family as we saw many many having a great time like us i understand that price can be a great concern but with the proper savings plan it can be easily done with ways to save in and out of the park we visited both disneyland and california adventure when the park hours were from am to pm but we were able to enter disneyland an hour early one morning because we purchased a day park hopper pass which allows you one early morning entry and the ability to visit either park at anytime during the day the limited park hours were offset by the very low wait times we experienced for our favorite big name attractions we also purchased the option of the max pass which is like a virtual fast pass where you can get fast pass return times on the disneyland app on your smart phone our strategy for rides were to get fast passes for the very popular attractions while filling the wait time by using the app to see which other rides had low standby wait times we concentrated on one park in the morning and getting our next fast pass in the other park just before transitioning to the other park with this strategy we were able to ride radiator springs times guardians of the galaxy times toy story arcade times soaring twice and other fun attractions in california adventure at least once in disneyland we rode indiana jones times and pirates and mansion in between we also rode many attractions in fantasyland like mr toad snow white etc we stayed across the street from disneyland see other review at the bw park place inn star rating i hope you enjoyed the review disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth ,5,2019-02-17
1315,Family vacation,let down the park isn t anything like it was yrs ago it didn t seem magical more like consumerism at its finest the wait times are ridiculous and the food was what you d get at a fair ,3,2019-02-17
1316,So much fun !!,what can i say this is the second time in the happiest place on earth my daughter and i planned a trip before she started uni and we had a ball walked for miles and miles and loved every minute ,5,2019-02-17
1317,Preparation is the key,i came with my brother huge star wars fan and his wife huge mickey mouse fan and we had a magical day i live here in ca a few miles from the parks my personal recommendation the day before sit down with your party and go over the park s map come with a plan where to go first then second attraction where do you wanna eat lunch etc don t show up with the let s see what the day brings us attitude or you are gonna waste a lot of time check the weather report bring comfy shoes comfort before beauty ladies and a back pack with a sweater or jacket usually the temp drops degrees at night here in orange county download the app on your phone also download the tickets on your phone once in the park get the disney maxpass this pass combines the ability to make disney fastpass attraction selections from your phone with unlimited disney photopass downloads for a day and you can do it all for the only per day per ticket price as of jan utilize the app go get fastpass set up your alarms so you don t forget to go back to the app and get another fastpass utilize the app to rsvp a restaurant in the park utilize the app yo download all your pix of the day in minutes be mentally prepared for the lines be physically prepared for a long day of walking don t miss the fireworks ,5,2019-02-16
1318,Always a good time,we visited orlando and now we tried here in california its smaller that wdw for sure but its still disney and we loved it the sleeping beauty castle is closed for refurbishment they do have the mix magic party in leiu of that overall you can never go wrong with disney lots of rides for little kids parade was awesome ,5,2019-02-16
1319,Erica,great time clean friendly user friendly great food great service great staff well lit great layout,5,2019-02-16
1320,The Happiest & Cleanest Place on Earth!,my boyfriend i traveled here all the way from southern indiana and it was well worth it we had a fantastic day filled with fun characters and great rides we were asked to join the vip room of mark twain s boat ride and not to mention we are official captains of the boat another great part of our day we re all the photographer s throughout the park to snap a photo for our memories we can t wait to return and have another great day and ride it s a small world one more time ,5,2019-02-15
1321,1st time to Disneyland!,it was great when my boyfriend and i went it was rainy on saturday and sunday morning so we were able to get on all the rides we wanted we ended up getting a vip tour of the guardians of the galaxy ride at california adventure eveything was amazing and all the staff were helpful and very friendly it was a wonderful st time for me and i hope to visit again in the future ,5,2019-02-14
1322,Fun for all,surprised at how high the prices for everything is from the souvenirs to the food we took our grandchildren and their parents we had great accommodations at the disneyland hotel we had a suite which worked well with of us over all very pricey not affordable for the average family ,5,2019-02-14
1323,Happiest Place on Earth,we have always gone this time of year a lot of attractions are closed for refurbishment and rainy weather but having the low crowds has always been worth it however the last years the crowds have been crazy we love disney and will go regardless i m having to rethink if it s worth the closed rides and crappy weather in the office season which is now crowded if we are going to deal with crowds might as well have all attractions open and warm sunny weather crowds and rain we still had a fun time how could you not at disneyland happiest place on earth ,5,2019-02-13
1324,"The best, most happiest place on earth",my favourite place in the world so magical expensive yes but worth every cent both parks can be done in one day if you know what you re doing but days is best i can t wait to return ,5,2019-02-13
1325,Happiest place on earth is much too crowded!,love disneyland but it s just too crowded the employees are not as sweet attentive and patient and bumping into people is part of the visit with all the strollers wagon and electric carts add all the people on the cell phones even on rides and it got pretty chaotic alcohol is served in california adventure too which added to the chaos walt disney would not be impressed ,3,2019-02-13
1326,Love Disneyland!,disneyland is definitely one of our favorite places to go as a family we have purchased passes two times now we do live hours from the park but we do try to go as often as we can every month and a half to two months we are a family of five so getting passes is really our only option we just love disneyland one suggestion to save money is to bring your own water and snacks,5,2019-02-13
1327,Happiest place on earth,disneyland is absolutely magical yes the crowds and lines can be extreme but i find it easy to still have a great time disneyland to me stands for fun and innocence the rides are full of nostalgia and memories of a simpler time the shows and parades and fireworks are all top notch worth ebvery penny to me ,5,2019-02-13
1328,Not as I remember it,i first went to disney years ago it seemed a fair happy place back then i revisted last week and the attractions were the same it looks like the place is stuck the people visiting seemed stuck too no healthy food mostly expensive fast food long waiting lines for tired rides i hoped they had updated it is a small world but no it looks and felt sad and tacky go for a walk in the park or take your kids to the ocean don t waste your money on this place dreams are not coming true any longer ,1,2019-02-13
1329,One day visit,we enjoyed this place immensely we did disney world last year and found it overwhelming disneyland was much more enjoyable for a small child we ll be back ,5,2019-02-13
1330,The only place in the world where our family all have a fabulous time,this is our third time here with the kids and we still love it we have seen the park for th july celebrations halloween but never the holiday season and the decorations did not disappoint coming from australia where it s summer it was wonderful to see the winter wonderland disney had created and at night time it was simply spectacular we stayed at the paradise pier hotel so had early access to both parks and had a day park hopper pass with the added maxpass so we could fastpass as many rides as we could this was the first time we had used the disney app and it was brilliant as we were able to adapt and plan where to go next according to which rides had the shortest wait times whilst still being able to fastpass rides you can only fastpass one ride at a time so the best way to maximise fastpass is select your first fastpass of the day and then as soon as you have scanned yourself onto that ride and you are waiting in the queue to get on the ride check the app to see what fastpass is available on another ride close to the current time and select that and then keep doing that all day night we may have zigzagged around the park but we know that we got to go on more rides doing that than simply trying to do everything in one land before moving on we love the atmosphere of disneyland and although there was nothing new for us to experience when it came to rides we had a fabulous time disneyland has something for everyone even if you don t like thrill rides not that disneyland really has anything too scary maybe splash mountain for some there is enough for people to experience and enjoy you do need more than day to experience everything we never do less than for both parks as rides break down and queues can be long even with fastpass options we love to go on our favourite rides multiple times lastly if you do want to dine at one of the themed restaurants in the park note that bookings open days in advance and in busy periods reservations go very quickly our family love disneyland as we are all there just to have fun laugh and a great time together creating fabulous memories ,5,2019-02-12
1331,Amused,best to visit in the morning to avoid long line try their turkey leg its juicy and tender bring home disney s flush toy since many of them are exclusive at the park only ,5,2019-02-12
1332,It’s not Disney World...,let me guess you are expecting parks a massive disney springs water parks and disney hotels surrounding the property well think again it s the original disney park enjoy it security is terrible and think they are cops most are ex military and really nice most are wannabe police officers and think they were in the military when they got cut from boot camp so try and pack light i understand you have children and strollers and diaper bags etc have all your bags and everything ready to go my suggestion give person everything and have the rest of your party with nothing get through security quicker mornings are terrible i suggest waiting and grabbing a nice breakfast at one of the cafes or hotel restaurants and then come late morning it s busier sure but less of a wait my wife and i are ap s and we love to do date nights more mainly because of work however all of you that have been here all day need to get dinner children need a nap you re tired you need a drink so it s our turn to play nights are great especially when the park is open to midnight please please please make sure you check when the park closes before you plan a luxurious trip here closing the park at hours because of an event is just absurd and kill your vibe usually monday wednesday the park closes at hours so please check the benefit between here and wdw the parks and downtown disney are all connected no buses no traveling no wasting valuable time it is also connected to the only hotels on property with more shopping dining and entertainment more time with family and friends and less time sitting on a bus with that smell enjoy disneyland and learn about the history and find all the secrets that are right in front of you just on main st alone there is a story at every window you look at ,5,2019-02-12
1333,Nothing is worth this kind of wait,i know it is all about making money but our day was ridiculous and a complete waste of time not only did we pay for the upgrade don t waste your money to help with the lines but we got there when the park opened it made no difference they need to limit the number of guests and that is the bottom line how much money do you need to make in a day when people are waiting hours to get on a ride travelling from australia with my wife and two kids including disneyland in our trip was a must but it was the biggest let down of our holiday i would encourage anyone to go to any other theme park as sadly disneyland is simply not worth the money or the time that you waste waiting in line ,1,2019-02-12
1334,Love it here!!!,this is our go to vacation every year makes us all happy and we can t stop talking about going everyone is friendly and the rides are awesome can be a bit crowded but we ve managed to figure out times that works best for us ,5,2019-02-12
1335,Great family trip,what can i say it s disneyland over priced tickets food and souvenirs over crowded with people wait in line for hours although going through the single rider line is great for a minute ride but where else can you have this kind of fun going as a child years ago and then going now that i m older it s fun to see what has changed and what has stayed the same yes i ll go back to disneyland but i ll probably wait until i save up enough money to go maybe in years ,5,2019-02-12
1336,Better than Disneyworld but...,i visited disneyland with my wife and children the security in the morning was so lengthy time consuming that by the time we got through the kiddos were done i completely understand security however more area should be utilized to get more people through after about hours one of the children says to me dad these rides aren t worth the wait can we just hang out together instead we left the park for lunch my kids were happy i m so glad my children are free thinkers ,1,2019-02-12
1337,Certainly the happiest place on Earth,had been over years since last visited and found that disneyland still puts a huge smile on your face whenever you go ,4,2019-02-12
1338,Enchanted Castle Closed :(,the title says it all but what else can you say disneyland is still the same and we all had a great time ,4,2019-02-12
1339,Perfect time to go,had a perfect weather trip a little rain but it was such a fun trip always a fun place to be we took advantage of the max pass this time around and we were glad we did fast pass from your phone is so convenient we also got home and ended up having over photos from all the different photographers throughout the park money well spent ,5,2019-02-11
1340,Disney day,had lots of fun with the kids got on all the rides and ate all the food best was in pirates of the caribbean,5,2019-02-11
1341,“A New Disney”,firstly i d like to point out that i hadn t been to the park in at least yrs but with that said i don t have children don t see the point this time i went with two friends from foreign countries and both had never been it did not disappoint the rides have all been refurbished redesigned and brought into the now the animation characters costumes are magnificent spot on the food including snack stations are much more health conscious and tasteful the park is more organized with the available ride lines moving quite quickly parking garage is huge also a secondary theme park called california adventure right next door as an alternative seeing it thru a foreigners eyes renewed my interest in the park well worth the cost ,5,2019-02-10
1342,Maybe DisneyWorld is better...,we were expecting to see plenty of disney characters walking around set against a huge castle with fireworks at the end of the day unfortunately none of this was true as we only saw characters with a small castle hidden behind sheets and scaffolding add to that the gigantic lines for rides and meals and you spend very little time actually interacting with the entertainment i can see the appeal for taking your kids but i can see there would be plenty of other options you would choose for the price you pay ,3,2019-02-10
1343,The Sweetest of ‘Disney After Dark’ Events,a little over two months ago my girlfriend discovered that disneyland park was planning another disney after dark hard ticket event this time themed after valentine s day and referred to as sweetheart s nite we were well aware just how popular these events have been in the past so we immediately purchased our tickets online via the annual passholder pre sale option after much anticipation the night had finally come upon arrival we parked in the mickey friends parking structure made our way past the security checkpoint and quickly boarded a tram to take us to front gate once we stepped through the gate we were both handed special lanyards wristbands and brochures by this point the time was around pm and while the event itself did not officially start until guest mix in had begun two hours prior this provided us the opportunity to plan out our evening while waiting in line at the main street starbucks we would continue down main street coffee in hand to the park s central hub we immediately noticed the painted facade outlining sleeping beauty castle which was interestingly under refurbishment from there we headed into adventureland and hopped aboard indiana jones adventure in no time flat which is unfathomable during normal park hours we would also grab a bite at the brand new tropical hideaway where assorted baos or breaded dumplings make up most of their menu a steel drum band played while we enjoyed our delicious snack we would then leave for new orleans square where we rode haunted mansion again in no time at all and experienced the first of many holiday offerings in the mark twain riverboat which was transformed into a moonlight cruise featuring a jazz band performing on the bow of the ship prior to this evening i had yet to experience the historic riverboat at night which made the voyage even more magical once we returned to port we hastily headed for big thunder mountain railroad in frontierland again little to no wait the shockingly short wait times would become a running theme throughout the evening to those who haven t experienced big thunder at night yet try it and see for yourself following the heart pumping train ride we would revisit the central hub and continue into fantasyland where we would enjoy dinner at red rose taverne the beauty and the beast inspired eatery s seasonal special featured minnie s surf turf artisan flatbread for two which was fairly reasonable in price as well as positively scrumptious and filling we would ride dumbo the flying elephant pinocchio s daring journey storybook land canal boats and alice in wonderland in quick succession before heading over to it s a small world to catch some of the royal ball where guests were given the opportunity to dance with their favorite disney princes and princesses including cinderella and prince charming ariel and eric and tiana and naveen we would soon discover where the vast majority of the crowds had gathered rare but popular disney couples characters including hercules and meg and milo and kida from atlantis the lost empire had garnered much attention from avid fans romantic disney movie backdrops had also encompassed the area for which guests could pose for pictures with their friends and or loved ones these elaborate photo opportunities included but were not limited to the i see the light lantern scene from tangled and a whole new world magic flying carpet scene from aladdin they too commanded extremely long lines so much so that we chose to forgo them altogether in favor of our walk on attraction marathon we continued into tomorrowland where we would ride both buzz lightyear astro blasters and space mountain with you guessed it absolutely no wait whatsoever to conclude our evening of after dark fun we jumped in the line at get your ears on a mickey and minnie celebration held within the tomorrowland terrace before exiting the park we were able to snap a photo with horace horsecollar which put a stamp on our perfect night i would strongly recommend disney after dark events to adults looking for leisure time within the park since only a finite number of tickets are sold the typical hustle and bustle is kept to a dull roar that being said i would also advise guests to choose early on in their evening between the rides attractions and the character meet and greets special event offerings as it is almost impossible to do it all in only four hours ,5,2019-02-10
1344,Disneyland,what can you say it s disneyland i love disneyland fun rides and a lot to see i like to come here every couple months it s always a good time some of my favorite rides are indiana jones space mountain pirates of the caribbean and splash mountain there are so many more you can do both parks in one day w california adventures but if you really want to enjoy the park i suggest you do a whole day at disneyland ,5,2019-02-10
1345,Same as Orlando but different feel,we are used to going to magic kingdom in orlando but decided to go to disneyland while in anaheim my family had a good time it was hard not to compare the two parks while we like magic kingdom better there were a few attractions we like better at disneyland space mountain and pirates of the caribbean were better in our opinion at disneyland it s was definitely worth the time ,5,2019-02-10
1346,So much fun!!!!,i ve been to disney world three times so i was anxious to see how i would like disneyland i loved it it s a slower paced than wdw and less crowd i definitely will be coming back ,5,2019-02-10
1347,Best trip ever to Dland,if you don t know i hope this doesn t ruin the secret but super bowl sunday is the best day to visit the park not only were most people at home it was raining as well what normally is rides at most became a day of rides an hour dinner break in downtown disney and we even left early ,5,2019-02-10
1348,Always a fun day!,we always love coming to dl as we are wdw passholders and dvc members it is smaller and quaint compared to magic kingdom this time it was the first time we were able to use maxpass it is an extra charge i believe but so worth it it allowed us to get on the rides we wanted first thing and pick another pass before the other one came up difference is that you have to be in the park for it to work not like the free fast passes at wdw that you pick before you arrive we felt it made it much more attainable to get passes for too rides we just had a day this trip we love haunted mansion and got to see it with the nightmare before christmas layover love it the castle is so pretty it would be great to take kids to see dl first then go to wdw to see the reaction to the bigger castle but the love of walt s original park can be felt as you tour and play all day ,4,2019-02-10
1349,Left a lot to be desired...but the Magic Show was AWESOME!,after having such a blast at the california adventure park we had high expectations which were met with mediocrity while the parades food and character interactions were fun the excitement definitely lacked most of the rides were a lot of fun and i couldn t believe my daughter rode everything the lines and wait times were kinda long even with the fastpass so we spent more time trying to pass time and wait on our ride times than anything else however i will say that mickey s magic show that night may have made up for everything both me and my daughter enjoyed seeing all of the disney princesses and characters in the show we were also in the vip section which gave us some amazing views i m glad we stayed for it even though we were dead tired and the food was amazing there was a mongolian grill near the indiana jones ride that had the best food we d tasted in the park ,3,2019-02-10
1350,All you will do all day is wait in lines...,my husband and i planned a trip with our toddler and infant to california for the first time in february my mom mentioned that this was the quiet time for disney and she bought my daughter a day pass for her third birthday so we also had to buy day passes for ourselves costing over what a mistake we were done with disney after just one day all you do all day long is wait in lines you ll wait in line to get into the parking lot then you ll wait in line to use the elevator in the parking lot only elevators in the entire parking garage for a park that accommodates people most of whom have strollers or wheelchairs you will then wait in line to get to security and then wait in line at security to be screened and to have them dig through all of your belongings then you will wait in line for the tram then you will wait in line for tickets if you didn t buy them beforehand online and then you will wait in line to finally get into the park all of this usually took about an hour minimum then you will wait in line for a ride sometimes a hour wait then you will wait in line to meet a single disney character usually a minute wait then you will wait in a line for crappy overpriced food then you will wait in a line to see one of the shows then you will wait in line to use a single change table in the washrooms there should be more than one change table in the washrooms at a children s theme park then you will wait in line trying to buy a souvenir then you will wait in line to get back on the tram and then you will wait in line in traffic trying to exit the park this place is a massive waste of time and money never again we ll take our kids somewhere that our precious time together won t be wasted ,1,2019-02-09
1351,Where all dreams come true,a beautiful experience back to childhood and all the characters we grew up with make sure you wear comfortable shoes and outfits there is a lot of walking involved ,5,2019-02-09
1352,First Visit of many more to come!,this was our rd disney park visit after orlando paris and california didn t disappoint it s lovely to see how the parks differ but they still all have that unique magical charm the only downside we had when we were there was that there was no fireworks in the evening bit of bad planning from us as we were only there for nights and one of those nights was a mickey s not so scary halloween party which we couldn t afford tickets at the time but will definitely be back in the future and hope to see fireworks then ,5,2019-02-09
1353,Disneyland Is BETTER than WDW,better weather cleaner park nicer people less crowded less walking our family loved disneyland california ,5,2019-02-08
1354,Another win,we had an amazing time making memories and loving the atmosphere we lost a set of ears and haven t had any luck finding them we submitted a search request and hope they are found the park said if they are found they would mail them to us free of charge that s going above and beyond ,5,2019-02-07
1355,Indeed the happiest place on earth!!!!,it is the happiest place on earh after hrs flight went straight to disneyland spent the whole first day beating the jetlag very unforgettable experience for days with parks even if it rained on those days people still line up and enjoying their day best of all clean restrooms everywhere everytime just amazing ,5,2019-02-07
1356,No Parades and No characters,three stars well yes given it s disney and given the price we expected more on the plus side the park was beautiful the lands are incredibly detailed and you can lose yourself in the different zones ride times were ok and the queues not too bad but it was frustrating how many rides were closed and then opened again later in the day you definitely need the app and disney don t give you free wifi now the disappointment where are all the characters we saw mickey once and he had to go for a rest as soon as a queue headed his way we saw woody twice on the run from autograph hunters can t stop guys biggest disappointment was no parades midweek come on disney we spend a fortune getting in a fortune in your gift shops and you can t give us some actors and cars parading round to delight the kids universal studios was just so much better value,3,2019-02-07
1357,Halloween was Incredible,halloween with two kids under the age of was a blast at disneyland they had so much fun dressing up and seeing all of their favorite characters in costume and the haul of candy that they got trick or treating was great we will definitely go again ,5,2019-02-07
1358,From disappointment to another try,the last time we went to disney was at christmas and we were so disappointed the cast members seemed miserable this time at disney we had a different experience our daughter needed a wheel chair because of a previous leg injury the wheelchair accessibility is awesome the cast members were sympathetic and so much friendlier lines were way shorter too being that it wasn t christmas i know i know it s a different time of year we have never gone in february before the weather wasn t great but the lack of lines made up for the weather skip the christmas madness at disney and pick february also make sure you get the max pass option with your tickets and use it whenever you can ,4,2019-02-05
1359,Disneyland or Lucasland....which is it?,just got back from january trip to anaheim and disneyland ca adventure not really a fan of marvel and star wars plastered all over they are decidedly not disney disney had nothing to do with either except buying the rights they need to be in a separate park somewhere else imo now on to the parks if you haven t been to disneyland lately they have redone splash mountain to where you get really wet instead of just a little wet i m talking grizzly river rapids wet so don t do this ride if you don t have a change of clothes or if it s cold out as we were in line to board i noticed folks getting off just literally dripping water off every item of clothing saw folks in line putting on rain ponchos and now i know why our car log had standing water in whole bottom that went from one end to the other as we went up and down soaking those in front and back with over over their shoes in the process during the ride at times who were inundated this is new and not necessarily welcome i was lucky to have duluth dry on the fly pants and boxer briefs on with waterproof teva high top shoes i don t work for either company but both products are great and the duluth really dries quickly sadly the donald duck hoody i was wearing had to be wrung out and was still saturated and useless in fact detrimental so if you aren t ready to leave the park to get new clothes or if it s not sunny and warm i would avoid splash mountain if you don t mind being literally soaked to the bone then jump on i wondered why the line was so short and after this i now know word must be getting around you get really really wet on the ride now the park overall was great except the castle was closed off completely for renovation so you had to go around pixar pier in ca adventure is not much different except for naming of stuff not too excited to see minnie mickey donald goofy and pluto removed from the ferris wheel cars but not a big deal tower of terror was way better than the guardians of the galaxy look to me and the one really glaring faux pas in ca adventure that i can t believe the disney folks haven t picked up on and fixed is the very dark blue sky background with clouds at the end of the street past hyperion theater it is not remotely close to the lighter blue of the ca sky which is usually mostly cloudless it seems so easy to me for the painters there to match the blue of a beautiful southern ca sky to the backdrop it s just paint after all so easy to fix and would look so much better walt would have pointed that out right away disney is still magical but still all about more than experience now ,4,2019-02-05
1360,Happiest Place On Earth!,we purchased our disney tickets through a deal on expedia for australian residents we purchased a day parks park per day ticket our tickets did not include the fastpass access that was an additional purchase of us per ticket per day we opted to not get the fastpass as due to the rainy cold weather it hasn t been as busy as we have experienced during previous visits the most we ever waited for a ride was minutes there was always long lines to meet the characters so we opted not to engage in them disney is undergoing a fair bit of refurb at the moment cinderella s castle is covered up completely due to being repainted during our day visit multiple rides were shut down temporarily and not running would definitely recommend using the disney app to keep updated on ride closures and wait times facilities were always spotless staff were always friendly and helpful would definitely recommend taking a packed lunch as the food inside the park is expensive and you will easily spent for coffee and snacks plus the lines can be long merchandise is really expensive and mostly made in china lots lots of prams can t comment on parking as we stayed close by and walked to the park only downer mickeys haunted mansion broke down today half way through the ride so we had to be let off by staff and walk the remaining section of the ride people who had used their fastpass for the ride were given another fastpass however those that hadn t used fastpass got nothing i feel that wasn t really fair but didn t let it ruin our experience or day ,5,2019-02-05
1361,Come on a rainy day.,there is not much better than a day at disneyland that small crowds and any more the only way to do that is to come on a day that it rains after all most people don t want to come in the rain but if your willing to deal with it it will be well worth it do to the much smaller crowds ,5,2019-02-04
1362,One to tick off the bucket list,such a wonderful place as disney fans it was a delight to visit the original park designed and created by walt disney himself something for everyone and so much to see we watched both the early afternoon and the evening parade because it was so good and great to see in the day and the night at two different angles only disappointment was that some of the castle was under construction so covered and it s a small world was closed as well but we had heard this in advance ,5,2019-02-04
1363,Not the Happiest Place on Earth,we went on what was said to be their slowest week of the year i guess everyone else in the world did too we lined up for minutes just to get in the park spent so much money on tickets and then spent half of the day standing in lines for a minute ride love the rides but overall not worth it different rides broke down while we were in line ,2,2019-02-03
1364,January is a Great Time to Visit,i have always heard that january is a great time to visit disneyland but i assumed that the lower crowds were only mid week i was very pleased to find that even the weekends weren t bad i arrived at opening on saturday morning and was able to walk right on many rides without a wait i go to disneyland a lot and can vouch for the fact that sometimes the park is very busy and yes it can be expensive but with a little planning you can find days and times that are not so crowded and if you plan your days ahead of time you can make the most of the cost if it s your first time get one of the books available that helps you plan your trip it s well worth it this one day january visit ended up being great different rides in one day ,5,2019-02-03
1365,"The Bad,Ugly & Fooled Again",the nickel dime theory has finally hit the magic moment get ready dollar parking fee the ghost town visitation of disneyland visitors is a joke in january was on our th year anniversary visit fastpass was minute waits compared to general minute standard wait times dont be fooled the customer service line to complain was minutes long they waited to give us fast passes for the next day lol the rides broke down every seconds on mermaids we sat in a pirates boat for minutes the cars rides no motor broke down all the time much of the park was dirty and the bathrooms were out of smell deterrent many of the staff had some type of issue with the policies compassion just only caring about having a job disney said they raised the prices to offset the crowd control mmm i see a million dollar new parking garage employee s wages forced up the new acre star wars attraction not impressed disneyland we are done with this park ,2,2019-02-03
1366,Need more staff at guest services area.,i have a disability and qualify for disabled access pass to rides i love that disney offers this but they need to streamline the process the whole point is to make me have to stand less but there s deep lines at every desk to get the pass for the next ride ,3,2019-02-02
1367,Disneyland..Is there anything better? Plus they have GF,we love disneyland we were just here in july and it was packed through some research we found that this time of the year is much less busy but don t misquote me it is still busy just less the only crappy part of this visit was that it rained on thursday like poured everything shut down due to weather currently the castle is undergoing a renovation so if you come before summer you will not see the castle before you go read some blogs about disneyland they are usually the most updated information if you are staying at a disney hotel the send you ride closers and updated information a few weeks before you go so that you are prepared my husband and i were disappointed when we were here in july as there were not very many restaurants offering gluten free options but over the last months we researched to find you just have to ask some options are available for mobile order some you have to order in person they also have a separate cooking area and fryers just for gf they have a policy that you have to talk to the cook and only the cook will deliver your gf meal,5,2019-02-02
1368,The Best Years of Disney Are Behind Us,in summary disneyland and disney california adventure are not worth the price they charge for starters the crowds we went on a monday and a wednesday in january and it was still extremely crowded for example just to get into the park it took me minutes to get through the security bag check more on this later by the time we made it into the parks the lines for most rides were already minutes long we did utilize the fastpass system but it is so limited in how it s used that you will inevitably be spending time in standby lines throughout the day on monday we arrived at am and left at pm we rode rides for most of the day the cars ride was a minute wait in addition the food and restaurants are way overpriced we did the blue bayou their nicest restaurant which you need to reserve a month ahead of time due to the crowds and the galactic grill their budget eatery the blue bayou has price tags that would have passed for a very fancy restaurant however we weren t that impressed with the food we all agreed that we ve had better food at chain restaurants than disneyland s version of an upscale place and the galactic grill was straight up awful the kids burger which was was literally a slider sized sandwich that consisted of two flat and bland buns resting on a dry thin meat patty my kids were horrified we had eaten at in n out the day before which is cheaper and far superior and my kids couldn t get over how awful their disneyland burger was for the price of admission that they are charging now i am convinced that i do not get my money s worth due to the crowds in order to experience more than a few things you either have to go multiple days or purchase a maxpass both of which cost even more money and in my opinion still don t deliver if you do end up going i would strongly recommend bringing your own food and water their food is horrible and very expensive we did this the second day we went and it was a much more pleasant experience this does necessitate that you bring a bag or backpack which means you will have to go through the security bag check so i would recommend getting to the park early so that you don t end up waiting an hour just to get into the ticketing area we did this the second day too arriving at am the parks open at am it was still mobbed with people but i was able to get in by am use the fastpass system as much as you can you will still end up waiting in line usually around minutes but it s much better than minutes the maxpass would be nice since it allows you to obtain a fastpass from your phone as well as have multiple fastpasses but it s an extra per ticket we just weren t willing to give any more money to disney after such a crazy admission price the only reason i gave stars is because the rides definitely are quality rides they are fun and exciting and tell a story and the park is very clean but as i ve stated multiple times it just wasn t worth it in the end ,2,2019-02-02
1369,Fun Place but crowded,try to go during off season and not a weekend we paid extra to use the system where you reserve a spot in line on your phone it worked well and was worth the money lots of stuff to do and we liked that we could bring our baby with us on a lot of the rides ,4,2019-01-31
1370,Awesome,disneyland park is great lots of fun for everyone i wasn t impressed with the cost of food items though we ate one night at the chinese take out restaurant we were famished otherwise i don t think we would have eaten it we chicken was not recognizable and the japanese terriaki did not taste like terriaki at all sorry would be nice to have more affordable food since we pay so much to get in the park ,5,2019-01-31
1371,Underwhelming,half of the attractions were closed when we visited yet we were still charged full price very crowded and long queues for second rides which were pretty ordinary over priced and over rated ,1,2019-01-30
1372,Dream comes true again,disney you do make dreams come true for young and old adults the parade was every bit what it should be one downside though is the incredibly bad and spotty wifi come on we expect a flawless execution on that side too ,5,2019-01-30
1373,Happiest Place on Earth,happiest place on earth will burn a hole in your wallet each year the price of disneyland tickets in orange county california keeps going up those are just the tickets which i think is each not to mention the burger combos inside lodging and transportation the kids love the place i wanted to run away and live inside the amusement park when i was young we all have our inner fantasies i think the cost is getting too ridiculous for the blue collar family man to afford a good time at disneyland it s only getting bigger since disney bought out marvel comics great place to visit but only once in a lifetime due to high costs ,4,2019-01-30
1374,Family Visit,we visited disneyland over a few days as three generations of the one family as our first visit queues for popular rides routinely run at minutes so it is definitely worth getting a fast pass which we had included as part of our four day tickets be aware however that once you get a fast pass reservation you are prevented from getting another one for a period either until the first one expires or about an hour or so before it expires we got a reservation for a popular ride that was four hours in advance of when we took it and the stand by queue was then only minutes so consider your tactics we were glad to visit over multiple days as otherwise we would have felt that we spent our time queuing instead of riding ,4,2019-01-29
1375,Far too many people,had very good memory s of visiting long ago with my wife and son after looking at isitpacked com i decided it might be a good time to go again well i wished i had read the reviews on tripadvisor before wasting a good deal of money on a hotel room park hopper tickets and gas to get from n calif the misery of fighting crowds and standing in long lines just isn t worth it a cast member i spoke with said this is the way it is all the time now i wish i would have well enough alone and just retained the good memories do yourself a favor and chose something else to spend you re hard earn entertainment dollars on ,1,2019-01-28
1376,Great time for kids and young at heart,second visit for the kid and first for me fast pass is way worth it bring comfortable shoes avoid heavy cameras paxk an i phone and call it good,5,2019-01-28
1377,First Visit,this was my first time to disneyland so i do not have any prior experience to compare this to when i purchased tickets at the gate for my mom and i the attendant asked if it was either of our first times i received a button once in the park that displayed it was my first visit a small gesture but made me feel valued and it was nice for workers to acknowledge it and ask if i was enjoying myself i went on a monday in early october and the lines weren t very long for the rides the lines for the characters however were very long especially for the characters dressed up in halloween costumes the park itself was decorated for halloween which was nicely done i would not recommend the parade in the afternoon it was very short and honestly very lame and nothing spectacular my mom and i spent about hours here and that was just disneyland not california adventure park i had a very nice time and it did exceed my expectations one last note and i m stating the obvious but brace yourself for sticker shock on everything admission food souvenirs you name it ,5,2019-01-27
1378,Not What it Used to Be,i am a southern california grandmother who remembers going to disneyland as a child and then later taking my son there when he was a child now i am able to take my grandchildren there unfortunately i feel an obligation to tell people especially people who pay lots of money for travel and accommodations that disneyland is not what it used to be disneyland is very expensive and very crowded and the rides don t always work last year i paid over to take my son and his family people to visit the happiest place on earth we were pretty disappointed because many many of the rides stopped working throughout the day i remember the days when ride closures would be announced ahead of time but these closures were intermittent and seemingly random we would stand in line for awhile and then be told that the ride had to be taken down for maintenance in addition we sometimes had trouble finding a restroom that was open three times throughout the day we were actually turned away from restrooms for the price that we paid i really expected more we haven t been back since and don t really have a desire to return in the near future please if you are planning to travel a distance book hotel rooms and buy multi day tickets think carefully about whether or not you really want to spend all that money on something that is sadly not what it used to be ,2,2019-01-27
1379,Better for young kids,disney is amazing the place is clean well run and you certainly don t lack for something to do disney park is probably more for the smaller kids though with a lot of the rides being aimed at a younger audience if you like the thrill rides go next door to disney s california adventure park also if you are there for a single day get the max pass for as it will give you better access to rides and also digital copies of all disney and ride photos and look out for single rider spots on the rides space mountain had a minute wait but we got on as single riders in seperate carriages in under minutes ,4,2019-01-27
1380,Disappointed,i went to disneyland november was very disappointing it was more for a yr old saw no mickey mouse no cartoon characters didn t really excite me i preferred universal studios as a child i dreamed of going to disneyland but wasn t up to my expectations,3,2019-01-27
1381,Happiest place on earth,we have been to disneyland numerous times we always get the day hopper pass which is available to australian citizens even if we are only there for it still works out cheaper especially after a long haul flight and u only have the energy to do a few hours on first day luv disneyland,5,2019-01-25
1382,Loved it,this was my first trip to disneyland after many visits to disney world i love this place especially at christmas the haunted mansion becomes nightmare i was in awe what a transformation and it s a small world is just beautiful can t wait to go back ,4,2019-01-25
1383,Love Disneyland,went in january and it was raining all three days but that was okay wait times were low and it was nice to walk around without all the crowds ,5,2019-01-25
1384,Magical !!,what a truly magical place disneyland was and is everything you could imagine and more definitely download the app on your phone and take advantage of fast passes ,5,2019-01-24
1385,Amazing,purchased a ticket that was days for the price of we definitely needed the days to get through everything in the parks as we went from th of dec and it was super packed and with very long lines at security and entrance there were long lines for all the rides but with a fastpass at the distribution you could get fastpasses for some rides and wait in line for others all the rides had amazing detail with the characters and setting and the park was very clean overall i had a great experience at disneyland ,5,2019-01-23
1386,Even Seniors like Disneyland,we spent one day at disneyland and got to do most of what we wanted before running out of time i had an unofficial guide book to disney but they say their suggested itineraries do not work if you do not have early admission privileges on days the park opens early what we found most helpful was the touringplans com website and their lines app you can choose what you want to do and the app organizes it for you to minimize your wait time then while in the park you can re optimize your schedule to stay on the best schedule check out the calendar online and go on a value day to save some money non peak days disneyland was smaller than i expected but there is plenty to do and we had a great day of park rides boat rides shows and a little bit of shopping if this will be your first visit stop at city hall just inside the gates to get a first timer souvenir button thanks for a delightful day disneyland ,4,2019-01-23
1387,Happiest place on earth,it s disneyland really doesn t need a review whether you are a big kid or a small kid visit disneyland get there early and figure out the fast pass system and magic mornings to be more efficient getting on rides the character breakfast at the plaza inn is a great way to see a number of characters without the lines and book a reservation at one of the nicer restaurants inside the park for good food park food is meh expect lots of walking and standing in line irrelevant of the time of year you visit but shoot for off season there are crowd tracker websites that can help with that ,5,2019-01-23
1388,Happiest place on earth...even on a rainy day!,we ve been planning this trip for some time sadly or happily it rained all three days dress in warm layers grab some dollar store rain ponchos and ride baby download the disney app on your smart phone get familiar with it before you go this will make you a much smarter visitor besides the map feature with the you are here dot you can check out wait times for various attractions and use in app purchases to add remote fast pass acquisition you can also scan passes for your party into one phone device for easy access and protection from loss finally if you want a sit down dinner in the park make a reservation before you go even a bad day at disneyland is a great memory making day ,5,2019-01-22
1389,Soooo disappointing,long lines and unhelpful staff and unhappy employees i don t want to even waste my time writing the rest it s just not worth it ,1,2019-01-22
1390,Holiday with our Granddaughter,park very clean but raining on the first day and no parade or shows on no reduction in admission cost which seemed a little unfair so much merchandising ,4,2019-01-22
1391,Two Comments,regarding the max pass as the site says review what you are buying for per person per day i had second thoughts are using it a half day as the regular wait line wasn t bad and a lot of the rides do not use the max pass so it may not benefit you the small world ride needs some serious updating its looks like it did years ago the animatronics need to be replaced and get rid of the christmas music its january already other then this i had a magical day ,5,2019-01-22
1392,Magic,like most people i have great memories of disneyland as a child i usually go to a disney park around once a year and disneyland is my favorite the crowds are usually insane but january after school starts isn t too bad just be prepared to wait and wade through a sea of strollers it s worth it for the magic ,5,2019-01-21
1393,WOW - just wow!,the original and the best so many character actors in the park to get photos with the kids loved the place so much ,5,2019-01-21
1394,"This is and always will be ""THE PARK""",all around the place is fun and nice and clean this park has so many things to see and feel that you can repeat many times rades are available for all ages shows all over the place fantasmic and mickey s mix magic shows are very good ,5,2019-01-21
1395,Good Park but to expensive,it has reached the point where the price for visiting is beyond the reach of many normal people the rides are great the maintenance is wonderful but on site purchases are beyond belief a bottle of coke is a slice of pizza close to how can a family affort such prices after paying a little over per person to enter i know that smoking goes against the family image that disney hopes to maintain but having only place where smoking is permitted is a bit much staff were friendly and helpful with all this being said it remains a magical place ,4,2019-01-21
1396,"Whether your not a big Disney person, or LOVE Disney, it's a MUST do!",a must do for people of all ages went with my partner and a friend who have never been big disney people needless to say they absolutely loved it you never understand the true magic of disney and disneyland until you experience it first hand tip go on a week day as it s quieter or better off a week day after a public holiday long weekend usually means smaller lines ,5,2019-01-21
1397,Way too many People,i have been to disney a number of years ago and unfortunately my calculations were a bit out as far as the timing goes for most us citizens to have returned to work so only managed a few fast pass rides ,3,2019-01-21
1398,"DISNEYLAND ""WHAT AN ATTRACTION""!!!",this has to be my most favorite attraction in so cal i attended college in so cal in the s this was my most visited site so much to see do possibilities are endless ,5,2019-01-20
1399,"Too busy, especially if you’re not into parades",great theme park for younger kids heaps of rides to suit year olds or those that enjoy the nostalgia we didn t really enjoy many of the bigger rides as we found them to be quite rough and bumpy indiana jones and matterhorn bobsleds for example our main issues are that if you go when it s busy when isn t it busy waits are long crowds are difficult to move through and don t try moving through the park when there s a parade or fireworks on near impossible we were trying to get from point a to b but they told us we need to go anti clockwise around the park through points c d e f etc etc etc very frustrating another frustration was that we planned our day around when we had fastpasses and went to grab some dinner hoping to sit inside as it was cold for something a bit nicer than pre cooked pizza etc at about pm in disneyland that closes at midnight well there was nothing everywhere that had anything half decent was closing and most of the seats at the very casual places that were still open were outside we ended up grabbing kebabs each at a place that gave us paper plate to share even though they knew it was for people during magic hour we were staying at disney s grand californian only fantasy land and tomorrow land were open yes less people in there but all in those lands anyway rant over i m sure it s more enjoyable if you live close by and can afford the time to explore each area over a period of time but when time is precious those things mentioned above are more noticeable ,3,2019-01-20
1400,You're never too old for Disney!!,i wish they d stop raising their prices but i m a disney freak so it s worth it the maxpass was totally worth the extra money too it s so nice being able to check in for a ride while you re waiting in line for another one and we got lots of great pictures with it too ,5,2019-01-19
1401,Well worth the cost of admission. Even for a Southern California local,this really is the happiest place on earth the cost of admission may be pricey but it is well worth it best time is at christmas time when all the lights decorate the park it s a small world holiday and christmas themed parade even for a socal local we always pass by it thinking whatever too expensive but then you go and it s freaking awesome best ride is space mountain for sure space mountain felt like being in space and zero gravity more than space camp take the little ones to it s a small world and finding nemo submarine ride to avoid crowds stay after pm when most people left for the night it is really worth the free fast pass service getting there is easy with shuttle bus services from lax and orange county airports don t rent a car if you are staying in anaheim disney land area is a good base for socal adventures with universal studios hollywood walk of fame legoland and sea world just a short day trip by train and good public transit options best place in los angeles area by far this is a place on your bucket list i tell you,5,2019-01-19
1402,Overcrowded and expensive,we are very loyal wdw customers and found disneyland in comparison quite disappointing the crowds were insane and we found the prices incredibly high we also found the staff at city hall quite unsympathetic and almost unbelieving when trying to organise a das pass for my eldest daughter ,3,2019-01-19
1403,Disney!,it s disney disney never disappoints we prefer disneyland over disney world because it s much more personal with the two parks next to each other the rides also seem better and faster than disney world ,5,2019-01-19
1404,Over-rated,we went as a family of four with two teenagers over from new zealand and thought the park was highly overrated expensive crowded and you get no advantage with a fast pass if you are coming from new zealand or australia don t waste your time and money just go to movie world on the gold coast as we found that a lot better than either disney park too much hype on the disney name ,2,2019-01-19
1405,“Happiest place on earth”,i visited the park with my wife and my years old son and we all had amazing days there the place is indeed one of the happiest places i have ever been the good thing about disneyland is that several rides and attractions are oriented to small kids and because of that my son really enjoyed the trip january is a very good time of the year to visit since it is not too crowded temperatures are fine oc and the likelihood of finding a great deal when buying tickets is high due to it being low season we spent day days ticket sale prices for canada residents the fantasmic presentation on the rivers of america is just awesome make sure you grab your fastpass right when you get into the park they are free and they run out of passes quickly even for low season another tip plan and make very good use of your fastpasses specially for busy days if you play smart with your fastpasses you will be able to experience all the rides you are looking for even in days the park is overcrowded ,5,2019-01-18
1406,First Time To Disneyland,as a child i only visited disney world and not disneyland so we had time to actually go by disneyland during a quick weekend trip to los angeles it was easy to enter the gates and have your purse checked and the lines went pretty quickly they do not let you do an advanced fast pass before you were at the park but i found there were a lot of options or we could do the fast pass once we got there it was a little difficult to navigate the park because fantasyland had the castle part closed and it made it difficult to try to figure out how to go around it i think you expect when you go to disneyland to see the castle so that was a little bit disappointing also i found that it s a small world ride was still playing the christmas music with christmas decorations since we are mid january i would think that you could work to get it changed over by that point overall i enjoyed the visit to the park i still think i like disney world better as it offers more options and different parks we tried to go to california adventure park but many of those rides that you wanted to see did not have a fast pass it was a lot of walking and i wasn t exactly certain if some of the rides fit my young son so i am not sure that the park hopper had really any sort of use for us i found it definitely something we could do in a day and then move on we did go to goofy s kitchen at the hotel and that was good because we were able to do the character dining we really didn t get too close to mickey mouse or minnie mouse during the park hours but we were able to see pluto a few times ,5,2019-01-17
1407,First Time to Disneyland,as a family of four we traveled to disneyland for the first time ever parts of the park were closed for maintenance including the fairy tale castle so no fireworks each night which was disappointing but we still had a really nice time lots of people as one would expect and we used the fast passes though i don t think we got the full benefit out of them due to a lack of understanding about exactly how they worked still and all we managed to do enough to feel like it was worthwhile so glad to have been and done it don t think we d go back but each to their own ,4,2019-01-17
1408,Way too crowded and everything is too expensive,we visited last week tue thursday for days at the park and holy smokes it was crowded and lines everywhere to ride anything prices for food and everything were way too high and almost all the food was terrible disney no longer keeps the park up like they did years ago ,3,2019-01-17
1409,Fantastic,love this place everything is done so well the whole family had a great day and lots of fantastic memories were made ,5,2019-01-17
1410,Max Capacity,we had an extra day before our cruise ship left and thought we d take our teenagers to see disneyland it was way too crowded and small world was closed other than trying to walk around and see the place we could only get on ride which took hrs of waiting in line nice to say they at least was able to visit and get the free badge ,3,2019-01-17
1411,Few tips for improve the experience,before buying tickets it s good to check open hours some days park is open only until p m some days until besides that park it s awesome add fast track to your ticket it save time and it s really cheap option ,5,2019-01-16
1412,"Great park, good times, but it is no Disney World!",first time to disneyland and although have been to disney world many times i had always wanted to go to the original cool things about it is you can stay at hotels that are literally across the street from the main gate entrance so you can walk to all the venues although similar in some ways disneyland is also quite different than the magic kingdom at disney world i was a little shocked at how small the castle is in comparison and the park overall is smaller but it is still a great park with many attractions and as is every disney property it is kept immaculate looking forward to going back again someday ,4,2019-01-16
1413,Christmas 2018,took the grandkids ages for christmas the weather was great for visiting at this time of the year mid to high s the lines were anywhere from minutes minutes i highly suggest the fastpass you can ask at any information booth about how to use it but it s pretty simple insert your ticket into the fast pass booth of the ride you want to get on and it will give you a time to go back they also sell a max pass which costs an additional per person that is basically the same as fast pass but you have the ability to schedule the rides from your phone no walking from ride to ride to swipe your ticket to get a scheduled time and you can order any pictures you ve had taken with the disney characters taken by staff wear comfortable shoes as there will be lots of walking we had the day hopper pass the staff were all friendly was surprised by the lack of disney characters walking around the park you are allowed to take in backpacks we packed snacks and drinks in it all in all i think we could of stayed longer to take it all in if we did it again which i won t i would plan a little differently i would go one day and then take a break from it we went to sea world and the zoo also then go back to disneyland and do another day take a break and then do another day it s just so overwhelming that those days breaks in between would of been welcoming towards the end of the day the kids were ready to go back to hotel and go swimming was it worth the money that s a hard one as far as the kids i m glad they got to experience it the time spent together and the memories made priceless ,3,2019-01-16
1414,Go in January! Mild weather and SHORT LINES!! :),i went years ago during spring break season and the lines were awful definitely go in jan like we did much more enjoyable was still crowded but nothing like my last experience loved every minute ,5,2019-01-16
1415,Just the best!,at years old this was my first time here i went with my son and my granddaughter who is and who s already been here once it was amazing to see her reactions to things everyone should go to disneyland at least once in their life ,5,2019-01-16
1416,Always Magical,regardless of crowd levels there s always something magical to do and experience at disneyland there s many attractions shows and foods to satisfy all ages ,5,2019-01-16
1417,Vacation,we had a great time we notice that the castle was different from the one at disney world yes we will go again,5,2019-01-16
1418,"For the day, I got my children back😥",my title is a little confusing but i did i got my children back as all families nowadays we become working too much parents and the children who think we are old and want to spend time doing anything else besides talking with or spending time with mom and dad we have been to both us parks at different ages and our experience is that the younger enjoy disney world but as the got older our trips to disneyland became more frequent because of the multiple other options in southern cali that teens are drawn to and the more time we spent in the parks waiting in line and just spending quality family time talking laughing and yes being a family we had drifted away from not the ride itself not the churro which are great but just that time stuck in line together is magical as has been all our trips to disney,5,2019-01-15
1419,Disney Wonder,our trip to disneyland was great and we enjoyed ourselves emensly we stayed at the marriott which was across the street and walking distance to the theme park hotel rates also reflected the off season with lower rates we got a room with two queens for per evening which was a pretty good deal looking forward to the new starwars themepark which is projected to open at the end of january has to be one of the best times to visit the themepark without the crowds i ve included some of our highs and lows during this visit the good january visits is typically off season which equates to shorter lines the week before our arrival which was the beginning of january was two blocks long began the taxi cab curb the wait times were also a lot better typically minutes the exception was the guardian of the galaxy ride which was about an hour wait downtown disney was also much easier to get a seat at one of the many restaurants the bad ticket prices are really expensive a three day was per person or roughly per day without a multi day pass this being an off season also results in some of the rides being off line for maintenance in closing the drive into los angeles was a nightmare so plan ahead and have fun ,4,2019-01-15
1420,Incredible,incredible place for family went for the day the rides were incredible the staff we encountered were helpful bathrooms clean lots of stroller parking which workers kept nice and organized ,4,2019-01-15
1421,Really is the happiest place on earth,disneyland just never gets old no matter how many times i go i am always impressed by the evolution of the park it has many of the old trusted attractions which are fun for the nostalgia and then the updates always surprise us just love it ,5,2019-01-15
1422,Universal>Disneyland,we went in the heat of summer so we were braced for the heat yet after we had paid for both the disneyland park hopper we realised that many of the main attractions had broken down due to the heat the performers could not parade and the fireworks were also cancelled we went to the reception at the end of the day and told them about our experience they were all extremely friendly and helpful and offered to give us a season pass or a full refund i must admit that made the day a lot better the next day we went to universal studios i would recommend it much more fun rides cheaper than disney great cooling systems and all the rides were working ,2,2019-01-15
1423,Dog care,great care taken at the kennel of my service dog some of the rides were closed i enjoyed the boat ride ,4,2019-01-15
1424,Disneyland Holidays,we enjoyed a visit with friends visiting from utah and from australia we has a wonderful time throughout the entire theme park the best days are on the holidays because the lines are shorter ,5,2019-01-15
1425,Disneyland during Holiday Break,shoulder to shoulder people very crowded during this time of year but the park was clean and decorations were beautiful mickey minnie and all characters were present taking photos with children and some adults great time except for fastpass process ,5,2019-01-15
1426,A must,every person should experience this magical place at least once in your life young or old alone or in a group what an amazing experience the characters the rides the churro you have to get a set of ears too ,5,2019-01-15
1427,Seeing Disney Through My Daughters Eyes,i spent most of my childhood at disneyland with my grandparents who had a annual pass no longer living in california i finally got to take my youngest daughter this year we picked a great day to go the longest time we spent in line was minutes and that was for the really popular rides the only bummer was that the matterhorn was closed and that was one of my favorites and splash mountain kept breaking down the park was not packed full of people which made it an enjoyable day aside from the humidity we went on some things two and three times including pirates the haunted mansion space mountain and even walked onto the jungle cruise ,5,2019-01-15
1428,overpriced and overcrowded,for the price you pay for a hopper and fast pass its not worth it unless you like to run back and fourth from park to park because fastpass only allows certain times for rides literally waste of my time and money,1,2019-01-15
1429,Magic,what can you really say its the magic kingdom we are pass holders and it is always fun to go we many many times during the year,5,2019-01-15
1430,Great time at Disneyland,our visit to disneyland was great the weather was perfect disneyland s christmas celebration was still going on all the christmas decorations where still up and the holiday parades where still going ,5,2019-01-15
1431,Disneyland,what can you say if you love amusement parks and disney than this is the place to go it was truly entertaining and a lot of fun even for an oldster some of the rides were different than in disney world but just as fun since this was the original happy place i was really happy to have experienced it ,5,2019-01-15
1432,Price Vs. What you get,it is totally worth it also it ll go a little smoother with fastpass the food quality is mediocre and overpriced and unfortunately there s no other option rides are fun christmas parade and fireworks are unique and they re actively trying to serve and improve ,5,2019-01-14
1433,Very crappy,disney land rides are long long queues the indiana jones and star wars rides were reasonable the fast queue only got us on rides and you still queue even with the fast queue thing we would not recommend this resort,1,2019-01-14
1434,So much fun as a family!,we visited disneyland and california adventure park as a family for the first time in feb from sunday to wednesday with a day park hopper pass and it was such a great time for all of us we had our three children with us ages and we re about to return again in feb so i ll share my recommendations and some things i learned from our first visit i definitely feel that how we did disneyland had a huge impact on our overall experience my thoughts on how to make the most of disney with kids be prepared if it s your first time read every blog watch every youtube clip and know what you re getting into some may think this would ruin magic but i learned so much and felt so much more prepared and efficient when i arrived for the first time i also asked my kids to make a wish list of their top rides attractions so that when we were there we could make those things our priority and not waste time walking around arrive early even if it s tough to get the little ones out of bed early it is so worth it the crowds are light in the morning and we had the most fun getting there early and beating the lines we rode all the most popular rides before noon before it got too crowded take a break mid day i cannot stress how beneficial this way for us we knew our kids would want to stay late into the night but we also knew they would be exhausted and cranky so we left the park each day around pm ate at a less expensive restaurant outside the resort walked back to our hotel and had a nap yes we had a nap our kids do not typically nap and despite the complaints on the first day even they came to agree that it was a good idea none of us had any trouble sleeping for hours and then getting up to return to the park around pm take extra shoes a lot of blogs recommend wearing comfy shoes i recommend taking a few pairs of shoes and changing throughout the day if possible i don t think it matters how comfortable your shoes are your feet will get tired and sore in any shoes after that much walking stay close by in we stayed at grand legacy which was great this year we ve chosen the best western across the street from the gates we didn t want to rent a car and worry about parking it is worth the extra to be able to leave the park and return to the hotel throughout the day from grand legacy it was an min walk awesome we also just go bus transfers through lux bus to and from lax it was so much easier and must less stressful than trying to navigate traffic and directions simplify wherever possible pack light for the parks my husband took a small backpack and i carried a purse it was so nice not to be bogged down with older kids it s easier to pack light i remember the days with babies and that is a whole different story all we packed was water autograph books portable phone chargers a must if you re using the app and light sweaters for evening use maxpass and the disneyland app maxpass saves so much time and includes the photopass use the fast pass for the most popular rides we hardly had to wait in line at all with the app we made dining reservations checked wait times everything also if using the app take a portable battery pack your phone will go dead and disney sells them for around us dollars if characters are important to your family try a character dinner we ate at goofy s kitchen and it was a blast up close and personal with the characters and our kids got their autograph books signed the food was pretty good too it s a buffet with something for everyone these are the things i felt made our trip great disneyland really is magical but it can also be very tiring and overwhelming for both grown ups and kids alike so you ll be glad you did whatever you could do to get ahead of the game we had a great time as a family and can t wait to return next month ,5,2019-01-14
1435,Way to crowded :(,as a single father of a year old i can tell you that purchasing annual passes for disneyland was a huge mistake i paid around i had to force and beg my kids to go because they hated waiting in terribly long lines last time i went guardians of the galaxy was a minute wait really who does that sometimes you will be standing outside the park for an hour just to go through security you have to get up real early to get there when they open and you can get or hours in but that s it after that very long lines the bottom line is my kids admitted it becomes like a chore to go there just buy a day ticket and get your fix in and be done with it you will get sick of it sick of the lines sick of the parking hassle and shuttles sick of the crowds you think you ll be going all the time but you ll see it s not so fun after all not the happiest place on earth more like the most crowded place on earth knott s berry farm is way cheaper and better thrill rides ,1,2019-01-14
1436,The most fun place on earth,i remember always wanting to go to disneyland as a child so to be finally able to go was a dream come true loved the whole place however the merchandise is a bit expensive to be fair as you pay a lot for tickets so that would be my only gripe great customer service from the staff whom are always happy to help great scooter facilities if you need them,4,2019-01-14
1437,Disneyland Never Disappoints!,we just returned from a post christmas vacation with our children and grandchildren and it couldn t have been more magical we had the privilege of being there for days great family time building memories ,5,2019-01-13
1438,disneyland is magical and wonderful,so much to see and do loved splash mountain and pirates of the caribbean are my favourite the lines were long but they moved quickly try to plan how you tackle this amazing place we did it in sections over days,5,2019-01-13
1439,Disneyland is Magical.,the park is still our favourite the cast members were exceptional rides and attractions so much fun this is our th time back and there will be more ,5,2019-01-13
1440,Mickeys not so scary Halloween party,we have been to disneyland many times but this was the first time we purchased tickets for the halloween party the park was less crowded we went on many rides with minimal lines without using fast pass the parade was fun trick or treating stations were great and we only hit up of the and had way more then we needed and the fireworks ended the night perfectly my kiddos wore their costumes and we saw many others dressed up which was a lot of fun while we definitely love disney and go at least once a year we will be back for the halloween party we used the party ticket for the park for the day as we were able to get in at pm and it did not end until midnight no need to go earlier as it is somewhat a busy time closer to the end of october ,5,2019-01-12
1441,Magical place,a magical place where dreams do come true met with the main man himself mr mouse we explored disneyland and watched the parade highly recommend we then went over to california adventures which was really good but the queues were pretty long churros weren t the best i wouldn t bother buying them souvenir shop caused some damage to my bank balance i can t wait to go back ,5,2019-01-12
1442,Winter at Disneyland,all in all january is a good time to visit disneyland while the property seemed quite crowded ride wait times were no longer than minutes with many just minutes the fantasmic show in frontierland is a must see it s simply amazing if you are planning to ride splash mountain do so early or wait until it s warmer we got absolutely soaked and had to find a restroom hand dryer to dry our coats and shoes unlike disney world there are is no free parking on site be prepared to pay at least to park ,4,2019-01-12
1443,"Very crowded, not enjoyable",we were very excided about visit disneyland park this was planned to the highlight of our holiday in us but it was almost a nightmare we choosed a weekday in september hoped less people because of school day the end of the line was at harbor blvd before o clock at security check we had to throw away our selfie stick i don t know why because later in the park we saw that many people used finally we could enter to the park after and half hour waiting with a years old kid in the park everywhere had to wait minutes for a ride terrible there were lot of people with stroller finally it was impossible to walk without hit a stroller and so on and so on we asked a girl from the staff and she told it was a very strong monday finally i can give only one advise to the management please limited the number of sold tickets for a day because it was a very bad experience for us because of the too many visitors ,1,2019-01-12
1444,So many strollers!!,as a first time disneyland visitor i had no idea what to expect other than crowds and long queues whilst there were both if you do you re homework you can make the most of your disneyland experience three of the best tips i could give would be stay at a hotel in the park buy a park hopper ticket and spend the a day for fast passes we got on every ride the better ones or times and only waited when it suited us as for disneyland parks they are amazing in terms of their scale if nothing else the disneyland castle was a lot smaller than i had imagined but still captivating in terms of what it represents we had a ball a felt we had achieved more than most at the end of our visit yes it s expensive but if it s something you re only going to do once budget accordingly certainly worthwhile doing travelling in the off season also means fewer people but some rides are down for maintenance last tip if you think you can do disneyland in a day think again cheers ,4,2019-01-12
1445,Excellent,we visited in november and was decorated ready for christmas the lines were quite long for most rides about hr but that s to be expected all great clean and very disney ,5,2019-01-12
1446,Over rated,overpriced and to busy for my liking you have to stand in lines for so long so for the day you might only have three riders if your lucky and it s too busy and people are rude wouldn t go back,2,2019-01-11
1447,Everything you expect and more!,disneyland is everything you thought it would be and then some this place has turned entertainment into a fine art our whole family had the best time and cannot fault it in any way it brought the kid out of us all a place we will revisit ,5,2019-01-10
1448,The Magic of Disney,spent nye in the park and arrived for opening as the park was open until am this meant that the park was really quiet until around am meaning we managed to do some of the larger queue rides with minimal wait time splash mountain mins space mountain mins pirates of caribbean mins as the day went on it got busier but the only ride we fast passed was the matternhorn bobsleighs this was billed as one of the busiest days of the year but arriving early made the day very easy and manageable ,5,2019-01-10
1449,Meh,too many people and too expensive at that price the number of visitors should be capped so that the experience truly was magical it has the same types of attractions as a regular park priced at a third of this we got to ride one ride on our visit the parade impressed me with all the clean costumes and the fireworks was nice but i would definitely not visit again very overrated place ,2,2019-01-10
1450,The Happiest Place on Earth!,always love our visits to disneyland and this one was no exception tail end of the holiday season so we got to see some of the decorations the castle was magnificent in snow and sparkling lights hanging like icicles our granddaughter loved the bibbity bobbity boutique a magical way to spend her th birthday since it was quite cold when we were there it would have been nice to have more indoor dining options or propane patio heaters still the best family amusement park ,5,2019-01-10
1451,DISNIEDOUT,i have two a and yr old first week of january and it was busy if you don t live in california have kids that go to school and you have not ever been to disneyland it s extremely hard to go when this place is not busy overall if you haven t been to disneyland go one time when the kids will remember it and spend at least days and try to avoid doing it straight days if you can because the kids will not wake up early and stay there until pm that s a long day and lot of money you would have to plan meals to bring if you want to save on top of that long lines waiting for a one minute ride fast track pass ridiculous it s a waste of money you would have to arrive at the park really early to make a good use of it and you ll be lucky to get rides with a fast pass i honestly do not think it s worth spending your money here you will have a way enjoyable and relaxing vacation going somewhere else where it s not overly expensive crowded and waiting from to mins hrs for a one minute ride characters it s about luck on busy days you want rides or meet characters how about shows no way unless you have enough time and money to spend to everything but you will not do it in less than days not the happiest place on earth after hrs here we had good experience in the past when kids were not in school but now vacation will be planned somewhere worth going ,2,2019-01-10
1452,Wowwww,thats why this place called magical you need at least days to visit this place everything is so magical that any age can enjoy ,5,2019-01-09
1453,A very happy place,we visited disneyland for two days on the th and th of december the christmas decorations are everything look even better and the castle looked magical at night our favourite rides were space mountain star tours the haunted house indiana jones pirates of the caribbean and the matterhorn the fast pass was good and the longest we had to wait was about minutes,5,2019-01-09
1454,Disney Christmas,great park to visit at christmas time not too crowded compaired to disneyworld in florida yet plenty to see and do we had a blast ,5,2019-01-08
1455,Disneyland is a classic,disneyland is disneyland although we were in one of the highest seasons crowds were still manageable ,5,2019-01-08
1456,Animal abuse and way to busy!,i recently visited the park and the most heartbreaking thing to see was the horses cart people all day to think you can use other means to transport people and the park chooses to use a horse extremely sad and some carriages are petrol driven should the park not consider electric the park is way to busy so it becomes hard to do anything with the wait period on average an hour so in the end a waste of money and your time just a money making scheme i personally will never return what a disappointment ,1,2019-01-08
1457,"Tooo crowded, tooo expensive, poor PhotoPass",prices are out of order way to many people you wait minutes in line for peter pan and get a seconds ride you wait minutes in line to get a picture with a character photopass isn t worth it my mobile makes better quality pictures than they do plus to few photographers ,3,2019-01-07
1458,The original Disney!,after many visits to disney world in orlando we finally made it to disneyland i was super excited to visit while i think the castle is super small here i enjoyed seeing the similarities and differences of the parks we enjoyed riding haunted mansion pirates matterhorn nemo voyage and indiana jones among others if you visit definitely get the maxpass which gets your pictures and fast passes i liked this better than the online reservations that orlando is currently using the park feels smaller and is laid out differently than orlando always fun at disney ,5,2019-01-07
1459,Wonderful Park,even crowded the park is amazing as always disney parks are very well organized and with wonderful attractions for the whole family i m glad that it could provide my family magical moments and amazing memories ,5,2019-01-07
1460,Christmas Day 2018-super crowded,if we had a choice to visit during off peak season we would the queues for the rides were hours the bobsled ride was out of action as one of the tracks had broken down they had to let in guests into our queue as the bobsleds in our queue were ok overworked equipment food was an issue all sit down cafes were packed snack stalls ran out early we went out to tony roma s and reentered the park to watch fireworks all in all a rather claustrophobic experience with people pressing all round go off peak ,3,2019-01-07
1461,Disneyland App was the major highlight!,we bought a day park hopper pass and enjoyed every single day of it the disneyland app was a major breakthrough and made our visit a way more pleasant one in the xmas holidays considering the huge crowds in the park ,5,2019-01-07
1462,A kids dream come true,every kid on the plant should see this place its a place where kids dreams come true there is so much to do and see once you are in the park everything except food and pictures are free i recommend that you bring food with you there is also lockers available for hire the food is expensive onsite but it does cater for most diets and cosines enjoy the park ,5,2019-01-06
1463,Annual pass holders and Disney lovers,this is an american iconic experience you must visit disneyland to live a full life my daughter has essentially grown up here not to be missed thunder mountain single rider matterhorn and space mountain the monorail red rose tavern gray stuff horse carriage meeting the characters the magic shop on main any parade or show we decided to get annual passes and use the app to check which days work for our passes there are changes coming so be sure to check all current sites for information we love the disney hotels but you need a deal to afford them one tip you can access the california adventure from the california grand backside super awesome and they have child activity centers open until late if you need parents night out ,5,2019-01-06
1464,Good experience,we took one day pass as our stay was short in la brought ticket online its better option as there is long queue everywhere from ticket to each ride and show so better to buy online to save time we went to weekend and holidays season so it was crowded and queue everywhere my daughter she is yrs and really love it and enjoyed bobbidi bobbidi boutique where she dressed and makeover like princesses staff was very nice with children while rides take long time as long quque later we had idea of online book ride book your slot at particular time on disney app then ypu don t need to spend long time in regular line and you can go through maxpass and you can also download free pictures in ride we enjoyed space mountain marathon bobslad mad tea party submarine tour finding nemo hunted mansion atuopia sleeping beauty castle and snow white story was really good while buzz lighter was ok as shortage of time and long queue one day was not enough for disney land there was really good spot for nursing mothers really liked it with basic facility including microwave and at night castle firework was awesome ,5,2019-01-06
1465,It’s not WDW,so if you ve ever been to the world be prepared to be a little disappointed there s a lot of similar things that you find at wdw one thing i noticed different was that i couldn t find mickey ice cream bars very easy when i did find them they were to frozen to eat i was also disappointed in the food at this park you just don t get the options as in florida if you have never been to wdw you will absolutely love this place ,4,2019-01-06
1466,Great quick vacation for us!,great park lots of fun for everyone we had a wonderful time as a disney world pass holder we found that there were new discoveries here ,5,2019-01-06
1467,Total ripoff - whole day waiting in lines,if you like long lines that s the place for you we have spent over us with tickets parking and fast slow pass for an awesome lining up experience particularly my year old daughter loved so much to spend the whole day waiting in lines min waiting time for parking and then another min to get to the main entrance then more min to purchase tickets still time to give up and then once you get in the waiting time goes stellar yeah as cool as starwars if you want to teach your children how to line up that s the place for you rather if you are after a magical disney experience find somewhere else or get a dvd that will be far better ,1,2019-01-06
1468,There's no good time to avoid the crowds anymore.,went to the park with our extended three generation family new years week our first day thursday was a mess there was no crowd control leading up to the security check points it took over an hour to get our back pack examined and okayed another minutes in line to enter the magic kingdom after minutes of shuffling in line the magic evaporated lines were long tempers were short and the prices all merch was higher than our last visit fast food was more expensive i paid for three chicken thighs at the plaza inn and where you can buy beer can t say we ll be back so sorry mickey you ve priced yourself out of my market ,3,2019-01-06
1469,Wish I'd had more than one day,visited here whilst on holiday in la and it was such an amazing day i have been to disneyland paris a few times and this obviously was quite similar in its look and feel i felt at home straight away there is so much detail and every land offers a unique experience california adventure was my favourite park out of the two the incredicoaster was amazing another thing which was surprising was finding a vegan burger in the park which was so delicious all of the staff we spoke to throughout the day were very friendly and welcoming we visited in november so it wasn t very crowded at all but the only downside was that there were no fireworks at the castle didn t realise they didn t do them during off peak season however the parade in california adventure was fab such a magical place would love to go back again whenever i am back in that corner of the world one day definitely wasn t enough ,5,2019-01-06
1470,Fun For All Ages,i have been going to disneyland for many years i do not recommend going during the christmas break it is just too busy to get full value for your ticket price park was not as clean as it was on other visits still a great place to go but find other times of the year to go ,4,2019-01-06
1471,Amazing,there are lots of books and websites devoted to this epic park definitely check some of these out and do some homework so you do not get overwhelmed and it can be overwhelming definitely download the disneyland app the extra is worth it for the maxpass which allows you to get a fast pass for rides and skips the long lines spend all day here from open to close unless you have small children who will get tired get ready to empty your bank account disneyland is expensive if it is raining bring rain gear and enjoy the shorter lines the shows and entertainment are great but not every ride is for all kids and ages ,5,2019-01-06
1472,"Overhyped, overpriced and outdated",tomorrowland pretty much sums up disneyland in a nostalgic vision of a future that has been left behind by reality our second visit in years found us fumbling with apps that have poor usability rides that lack the wow factor of neighbouring parks and outrageous prices for food and drink and wait times in holding pens that afford no interactivity other than the horrendously poor guest wi fi that doesn t even have full park coverage space mountain at over minutes wait time on a good day is no longer a bucket list ride and many of other once iconic attractions lack the polish and sophistication of other parks save your time dump the kids in disneyland and head on over to adventureland park it s still the same crappy app but at least guardians cars and the incredicoaster are worth the wait times ,3,2019-01-06
1473,Amazing,spent new years at disney loved it disney does it properly it was busy but it was expected had the best time love disneyland and all they offer couldn t recommend it more ,5,2019-01-06
1474,Fantastic!,the park was clean and beautiful employees were wonderful and food was really good make sure to buy the extra app for reserving your fast passes well worth the extra per day per person no need to purchase park hopper one full day was enough for california adventure ,5,2019-01-06
1475,Compact But Intimate,this was my first visit to disneyland i am a disney world veteran yet found the original disney park intimate it is on a smaller footprint and compared to disney world compact yet i liked it very much i particularly enjoyed how the attractions overlap for instance the disney train rides across the fa ade of it s a small world a monorail rides over the submarines and you can practically reach out and touch the bobsleds on the matterhorn also the pirates of the caribbean here is longer and had a bayou scene before you get to the pirates also the haunted mansion had a holiday overlay as did small world i gave it one less star because of the fastpass process at world you can get three fastpasses a day and choose them days in advance if you stay on property after exhausting them you can get one at a time all this can be done with your app and all complimentary at land unless you pay you must go to the attraction s fastpass distribution center get a fastpass for later in the day then return at that time the clincher is that you cannot get another one while you wait for the one that you got one day small world was sold out of passes so i walked all the way to pirates only to be told that they don t distribute fastpasses so i went back to the matterhorn only to find out that they weren t distributing for the day i can only say that walt disney world spoiled us however we did enjoy our visit to the original park ,4,2019-01-05
1476,"Queues, Queues",disneyland is a great place everyone is happy rides are safe and fun there s something for everyone we only made it to one ride purely because of the lines and wait time we even had the fast pass but it made it harder since you could only book one per every hours the lines are still moderately long with them as well ,4,2019-01-05
1477,Very nice but not as good as Disney World,being from the east coast we have visited the disney world theme parks many times so we were excited to finally have the opportunity to visit the disneyland theme parks on christmas day we paid person for max pass and thought it was worth it to be able to arrange fps on the app we didn t even use it for the photopass feature but still would purchase it again we found the parking and getting to the parks from the parking lot a little more complicated and longer than what we ve experienced at disney world and when we got off the bus that took us to the park from the lot the signs were awful and there were very few cast members around so many parties from our bus went the wrong way and lost precious time getting to the gates we started at california adventure and had done everything we wanted to do by pm so we went to guest services and had them add a park hopper to our tickets since we got to disneyland park so late in the day many rides were out of faspasses but we were still able to ride some rides we wanted to go on we rode jungle cruise which wasn t as good as the one at mk but maybe our guide just wasn t particularly funny space mountain which was much better and darker than the one at mk holiday themed it s a small world which was beautiful on the outside but not great on the inside because it felt a little awkward having the christmas decorations and songs while going through cultures that don t necessarily celebrate christmas the lines were too long at some other rides we might have gone on and it was too late in the day to get faspasses but we thought the park looked beautiful especially the new orleans section the lit castle and the outside of small world we were also tired since we had arrived from the east coast the night before so we left the park around pm and probably would have had a chance to ride several more rides if we had stayed until closing we also ordered dinner at red rose tavern from the app and chose our pickup window so we didn t have to wait on a long line which was great all in all we enjoyed the park but felt we d done almost everything we wanted to do and didn t feel the need to return all four of us also felt that dca somehow lacked the magic that we always feel at disney world part of that might have come from the fact that we didn t fine the cast members as helpful or friendly except for those in guest services at dca who were wonderful as they are at dw and part may have come from the fact that the park wasn t nearly as immaculately clean as dw always is litter on the ground dirty bathrooms tables in red rose tavern left with garbage on them etc ,4,2019-01-05
1478,disneyland,love coming here we love the cleanliness of the parks i still give a star but i do hate the crowds the park has long waits for the rides so use maxpass i hate that you have to pay extra for the fast pass app if lines were shorter it would be great food options are great had carnation cafe yesterday and soup was awesome enjoy coming here and making memories just wish it was less busy ,4,2019-01-05
1479,Disneyland Fastpass,fastpass if you buy fastpass with disneyland pass then make sure to book the ride as soon as you enter disneyland park you only able to book one at a time don t miss the night water show ,5,2019-01-05
1480,Absolutely Enchanting Park for Young and Old,although this is an expensive amusement park at over per person for adults it is a must see for everyone walt disney called it the happiest place on earth and i wholeheartedly agree ,5,2019-01-04
1481,"First rate atmosphere, too crowded/expensive",everyone knows the park has amazing atmosphere and attention to detail unfortunately the high prices and crowd level detract from the experience it s something you should definitely do in your life but you have to do it right go early on days projected to be not crowded get max pass and use the fast passes wisely for the popular rides they charge you extra for max pass but it s worth it this is an example of them being greedy when you re already shelling out tons to get in and bucks to simply park bring some snacks so you don t have to buy expensive food for every meal follow that advice and you will have a great time you will still spend a lot but it is worth it ,4,2019-01-04
1482,Good fun but very crowded,we went on a saturday which is apparently one of the busiest days rides were good but some booked out definitely get the fast pass and use the app didn t wait for the parade as it was so crowded if going with younger kids i would go to this park early before it gets so crowded then to california park ,3,2019-01-04
1483,Disneyland is great for all ages!!!!,seeing all the christmas lights and the whole place in holiday lighting was truly breathtaking we were the day after new years and got to see a rose parade band participants so much fun they were and outstanding band from flower mound high school just so fun for the kids to see other kids performing these kids were awesome the grounds of the park were so clean and everything was just beautiful very busy but if you sign into fast pass and use the map to plan your rides even on busy days we had a great time ,5,2019-01-04
1484,Happiest place indeed,a beautiful place that can be enjoyed any time of the year however i strongly recommend proper planning to make the best of the day here do take the fastpass and make the most of it i did most of my rides through this and saved a lot of time start with space mountain it is the most popular ride and rightly so and the line gets progressively longer in the day follow that up with matterhorn bobsleds and then all the other rides it s a small world is a beautifully made ride and must not be missed too many roller coasters became a bit repetitive but it was fun the theatre performance and the parades are a must watch as well so watch out for the timings for these the maxpass is not worth it at all very few options for pictures in disneyland may as well pay dollars for select pics and use your phone elsewhere have fun ,5,2019-01-04
1485,Smaller than Florida but still good,we actually liked the california parks better than the florida because is smaller less people as well it didn t feel so crowded we went during christmas times more lights then usual beautiful day in each park is enough my boys are teens so lots of small children rides we didn t go ,5,2019-01-04
1486,Great time in the happiest place on earth,gosh two days is just right stay close to the park and walk home for siestas it s fun mornings and evenings so you can experience the park at night in addition to daytimes the parades are amazing and the fast pass thing is worth the extra money as it can reduce ride waits from hours to minutes we were able to get about fast passes every day by getting into the park early and placing new reservations every minutes january st was very low volume in terms of visitors ,5,2019-01-04
1487,Would you like some ears (or churros) with that?,i visited disneyland with my teenage children when visiting from australia in january it really is quite hard to fault the atmosphere is sensational i can t imagine too many other places where i d happily queue for that long we were there on new year s eve and new year s day i was amazed at the number of people donning mickey or minnie ears or other disneyland memorabilia you could see the littler kids totally captivated by everything disney especially the parades the staff are absolutely excellent every single one nails the customer experience even amid the crazy busy days the fastpass arrangements are sensibly priced work well and are equitable it allows you to make better use of your time take that option if you can be sure to stay late shorter queues and book dining if you re there at peak times like when we were there otherwise your only option will be long queues for fast food we definitely consumed too many churros but they were good and they did seem to keep leaping out from around every corner the rides are excellent fun without being terrifying i like it more than disneyland in paris and it kills the theme parks back home in australia i think you could go at any age and have a great time ,5,2019-01-04
1488,Fun fun place but smaller than most Disneyland,great fun place the rides are suitable for young kids download the disney app and take the express pass it s fully worth the price lots of good rides loved the space mountain ,5,2019-01-04
1489,Holiday Disneyland Experience,the crowds are a cause for safety concerns we arrived new year s day which was actually nice however today january rd the crowds were so large it was aweful the park is decorated extremely nice especially showing its beauty at night the average main rollercoasters averaged hour waits when not using fast pass enjoyed most of my trip but hope not to come back again for years at least ,2,2019-01-03
1490,Magic killed by horrible overpriced food,the attractions are really good typical disney some of them have been the same for the last years but they are still magical we did not go with any child son the perspective might be different from one of a family with children but all the magic of the place was killed by horrible and uber priced food my wife and i are vegetarians and we had to look hard for a place to eat the first place had a jack fruit burger that tasted horrible really sour tasted like vinegar my wife ordered a salad who can kill a salad that was also inedible one of my friends be arely bit on a jack fruit burger and ended up vomiting another one ate half of a hamburger that was too tough we spent almost in another meal i ordered a slice of pizza a small slice a salad and a fountain drink my wife got two slices of pizza no drink and i paid almost those were ok average at best my recommendation is go outside the park to eat downtown disney has some overpriced food but at least is good ,3,2019-01-03
1491,Lines were just waaaay too long,great rides but lines were just waaay too long think disneyworld is significantly better in that respect ,2,2019-01-03
1492,Do NOT go on NYE,we ve been to both disneyland and disneyworld several times during peak summer days crowds rated as a but that didn t even prepare us for nye it was a nightmare the only reason i didn t rate star is because we started at ca adventure and were able to get big rides in early with the max pass by the time we got to disneyland after lunch all of the fast passes were gone and the thrill rides had waits of minutes plus with some over hours we even had to wait minutes for the restroom and that was the shortest line we could find i don t think i saw anyone adult or child after pm that didn t look completely miserable even my kids wanted to leave early and that s never come close to happening disney should be ashamed of themselves for letting so many people into the parks you may think it will be worth going next nye but don t just don t do it i m now a convert to the take the kids out of school mentality go in early december to see the amazing holiday decorations ,2,2019-01-03
1493,New Year's Eve = Chaos,positives the classic attractions were fun such as the mountains and lasted a while because they are old and hence were not built to reduce queue times the re theming of the haunted mansion for christmas was very well done negatives the cast members were very rude and did nothing about queue jumpers when we told them about the issue very long queue times and on new year s there were so many people trying to leave that we literally stopped and stood still for about minutes trying to move as always very expensive in every regard fastpasses all gone by midday difficult to get to from l a hope that helps ,3,2019-01-03
1494,Get The MaxPass!,as a socal resident we frequent the disney parks in anaheim the best advice i can provide is to spend the extra per ticket on maxpasses it allows you to schedule your fastpasses via your phone on the mobile app without having to run from station to station also you can get all of your photos from the rides our family is generally able to get on all of the rides even with ridiculous wait times at least once a day the app is super useful in other ways you can order food book dining reservations and see the parade and show schedule we love it ,5,2019-01-03
1495,Fun Fun Fun,yes it is a very expensive vacation but for us it is worth it our teen kiddo turns into a year old child the minute we cross the gate and that includes my husband as well the memories created are priceless definitely take your time and don t try to do everything i feel as if people set their expectations very high due to the high prices which is very understandable but we know that in the days we normally spend at the parks we will only see a fraction of what is open and available lines are a fact in disney but max pass helped even though i have to admit it can get pricey at per person per day for my family for our park days it was i have to agree that quick service food very similar to fast food is awfully expensive but you are able to bring food from the outside we saw several people bringing in food in disposable containers that could just throw away even a lunch or snack can save you lots of money the family next door to us at the grand californian actually had groceries delivered and explained to us that even with the delivery fee and the price of the groceries they actually saved hundreds eating for a family of that it more than made up for hotel accommodations on site i honestly never thought of it from that angle but it made sense after we got home and did the math on what with spend just for food we are thinking of trying their system the next time we go as we fly in from out of state are not in the position of bringing food with us we did make dining reservations ahead of time and invested in the max pass which proved to be priceless for us as well the weekend crowds were insane which is why those were non park days for us we can t wait to come back again ,5,2019-01-03
1496,Back after 30 years,the park is as i remembered but i looked around at the background more than before there are magical touches everywhere took a bit to figure out the fast pass system and would recommend it and the disney app to see wait times ,4,2019-01-03
1497,Christmas at Disneyland,i just needed to take a moment and commend one of your employees although your entire staff and park are tops you had one particular staff member just shine above the rest let me first state that this is the th time we have visited your parks but this was the first time that we needed to use any of your handicap entrances for special assistance my wife is a brain cancer survivor who has undergone brain surgeries although my wife can function fully she has a hard time walking without a cane or assistance and fears being bumped into and dropped we opted on renting her a manual wheelchair for my kids and i to push her since she was in a wheelchair we then had to take special entrances on particular rides which were very user friendly at one particular ride pirates of the caribbean we had to use a special entrance where we were assisted by nicole no last name requested but this was on between pm who had this back assistance area running like a well oiled machine she rotated all the chairs so when the people coming off the ride came back to where their chair was waiting and then kept shifting so you didn t have to look for your stuff but instead it was waiting there for you she was so kind and friendly but most importantly efficient prior to this visit we had never had to use any of these special needs entrances so we never noticed what goes on in the background but now needing the help it is important for disney to know that it is greatly appreciated especially when my wife feels like if she is already a burden there is nothing like the disney experience clean parks helpful employees and new to us very accommodating special needs access as well please tell nicole that she truly made an impression on our family and we will not soon forget how important she made us feel sincerely arturo sanchez jr and family,5,2019-01-03
1498,Many rides closed down,busiest season which i can understand that but really disappointed if we have waited for too long already and being advised the closure of the rides due to some issues which i also can understand that but when it happened not one but or more rides a bit disappointed as the ticket is very pricey for the busy season ,3,2019-01-03
1499,"Too expensive, over crowded.",do not waste your money disneyland is not magic anymore expensive over crowded poor food it is like paying fine dining prices for macdonalds takes forever in lines to go on any ride and then you realize that you pain hundreds of dollars to stand in a line ,2,2019-01-02
1500,Magic,we went to disneyland after our wedding with our family memebers and had sooo much fun it s a great place for kids and adults everyone can enjoy we will go there soon,5,2019-01-02
1501,Magical Disney,disneyland is true magic yes there is lines lines and more lines a handful with long wait times for certain rides yes it is pricey yes it is crowded but disneyland is still a great place for everyone the park is always kept clean including the restrooms the true magic is when it snows on main st the park is so beautiful at night during the holidays i was there for christmas week and even though it was a nice vacation there were to many people i couldn t enter disneyland until pm i had to go to california adventures until then i wanted this trip to only be disneyland the reason was due to the disney side being sold out to get the full disney experience plan on going more than one day you can t fit everything into just one day go when the least popular time of the year to go if you can download the disney app use fast passes our personal favorite rides are pirates of caribbean haunted mansion raiders of lost ark it s a small world walt disney accomplished want he wished for he would love how his dreams have continued ,4,2019-01-01
1502,Loved it..magical at Christmas,we had so much fun and the fireworks show at christmas and the christmas parade were unforgettable what a special family trip this has been we love you disney ,5,2019-01-01
1503,What can you say....,disneyland truly is a magical place christmas enhances the experience even more decorations fireworks snow and music put one in the spirit this was my first christmas time trip to a disney park so glad i went lots of people but not as crowded as i had anticipated fast pass is a must ,5,2019-01-01
1504,Kids absolutely love this place!,so if you delight in joining other folks experiencing something extraordinary all at the same time waiting in line for hours for rides and eating popcorn corn dogs and other super healthy not fast food which cost totally exorbitant prices then disneyland is the place to bring your family to sounding pretty cynical i know however on the other hand this theme park is pretty darn exceptional and children of all ages yes including a lot of adults really love it me i m a one day only type of poo hoo adult but saying this after the fact i find there are ways to truly enjoy this park buy the fast track tickets spend a little more on the entry pass to ensure you jump the ride lines and wow a totally different experience awaits disney allows you to bring in your own food so do it come early opens at am or come late closes at midnight have to say the parking is pretty easy with well serviced shuttle buses so all in all my grandchildren simply love it so i love it too just for that reason vicki sydney australia check me out on instagram at vickisworldview,5,2019-01-01
1505,New Yesr’s Eve in Disneyland,we visitied the disneyland park for days everything was fine even the weather as we went in december however we had visited disneyland in paris and we loved it it had bigger open spaces and the main castle was huge moreover it has a five stars hotel at the main entrance which makes this part very beautiful ,5,2019-01-01
1506,Let the fun begin.,disneyland is by far the happiest place on earth sure there are long lines and high prices but it is still worth it i am spoiled due to my annual passport i just love the place so many things to do or just sit relax and watch the people i hope you enjoy your trip too ,5,2018-12-31
1507,Disneyland park visit during Christmas vacation.,disneyland visit on any day is a treat to your eyes special during christmas vacation though all rides are fun enjoyed most the small world in fact visited twice with children ,5,2018-12-31
1508,Family Vacation,it s disneyland it really is kinda magical and definitely a blast if you are fully prepared so be prepared for large crowds long lines high prices and hot weather love disneyland vacations with the family and will keep visiting when i can ,5,2018-12-31
1509,At least the memory of Disneyland is pleasant,this is my first review i travel an average amount mostly to my home town of san diego i wanted to give a fair account of what disneyland is now like but first a travel back in time i think it was always expensive as my dad only took us once a year this is what i recall of the tram ride back to the car then happy animated people talking about all that they had done i rode space mountain times matterhorn was awesome the light parade was so beautiful we all had mickey ears on and big giant lolipops and sometimes these beautiful little crystal figurines in shapes of our favorite characters my visit was friday december th we were a bit late getting there so parking was deceptively quiet after an astounding dollars to get in for my daughter and i we went through the gates and under the little train archway and were met with crowds i have never seen anywhere in my life you could see nothing but people swarming everywhere my daughter suggested a fast pass they were out of them completely except for splash mountain at p m at night it was p m we were hungry but saw no available restaurant at the moment serving anything appealing we bought churros and a hot chocolate and a water over we then began our line standing minutes for pirates ditto for star tours minutes for thunder mountain splash mountain was quick but only because it was late and freezing outside i looked at all the people no one looked particularly happy except those that do their best to make the best out of a bad situation many people from different parts of the world lots of different languages and accents which is a beautiful thing i just felt bad for them i wished they could have the disneyland experience they paid for i gave it stars because people reading star reviews are often working to weigh the pros and cons one star for the christmas lighting of small world and the castle one star for the hot chocolate and one star for having clean bathrooms despite tens of thousands of people but worth the money no way i did not feel good about the spending that vaguely yuck feeling when you have purchased low value we could have spent that kind of money in a dozen different ways and felt uplifted at the end of the day instead we were exhausted the tram ride home was full of quiet defeated looking people ,3,2018-12-31
1510,Vacation 2018,we visited the park for the very first time this was our first trip to california and felt disneyland was an absolute must we have visited disney world in florida several times and my review compares to trips there i would not return to this park in the future i felt as though the park was way understaffed for this high week in tourism the lines were tremendously long as you would anticipate but very few staff controlling crowd movement thru the park it didn t feel as though it was a well run disney machine like we have experienced in the past along with the mob feeling we had we noticed this park is not kept as clean as florida again i would attribute this to the lack of proper staffing it felt like the higher ups just said stuff as many people in here as we can and we will just blame it on vacation week i would honestly spend the money on something else while in california ,3,2018-12-31
1511,Must go Place,we really had a great time here don t forget to take fast pass to cut the queue download disney app before you go cause it really helpful to get you fast pass and ordering meal during the holiday season ,5,2018-12-31
1512,Vacation,disneyland always great very busy but its the holidays lots if different holiday foods to try recommend going during holiday s,5,2018-12-31
1513,** Our Happy Place **,disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth i you haven t been yet definitely put in on your bucket list we went a few years ago for the first time and have been going back every single year since it caters to every age group we love the pin trading too p staff throughout the park are super friendly and courteous for accommodation we prefer off site saves hundreds of dollars that can be used elsewhere for the more fun stuff food and beer at dca or dd is generally y u m m y would go back at the drop of a hat all the other disney parks are now on our bucket list yessssss ,5,2018-12-31
1514,13 birthday trip and christmas,we got a day park hopper and that was good enough for this time of year it was soo busy especially the th and th christmas is so magical in disneyland love going this time of year ,5,2018-12-31
1515,Strategy over Christmas Holidays,so as not to be disappointed for this theme park that is unbelievably busy over the holidays stay at a disney hotel so you can take advantage of the magic hour and get into the park an hour early get the disney app so you can track wait times and if rides are down get to the park early you should be at the park gate by at least am so that you will clear security and enter the park by am plan your ride strategy and first go get a fast pass at one of your favourite rides first fast pass will typically be from to am and then take advantage of the early admission to ride at least of the most popular rides manage your fast passes as soon as the time on the fast pass has been reached you can get another fast pass most of the popular rides will have wait times of an hour or more by am the wait time with the fast pass is rarely more than min check park opening hours for magic hour sometimes frontierland doesn t open until am even with magic hour access other recommendations for fine dining i highly recommend you book one of the many disney restaurants my favourite is carthay circle if you have small children take advantage of the character breakfasts such as plaza inn yes they are expensive but you can get photos with many of your favourite characters all in an hour saving you from the to min wait times at individual character locations all restaurants need to be booked several months in advance over any holiday ,5,2018-12-30
1516,Family trip,decided to take our fam to disneyland got there at am took an hour min to get parking and went on rides entire day it was sooo packed and cold would need to visit on a non holiday time next time ,4,2018-12-30
1517,Tanya the watch sales girl,she was the best attraction once in the park as she had so much history of disneyland that we could not pull ourselves away from where she was selling watches thanks tanya c and sam,5,2018-12-30
1518,Exceeded expectations!,what an amazing day i was completely blown away with the experience cannot recommend enough we were there from am pm and enjoyed every moment even with huge amounts of people we never once felt crowded or like there was not enough space fireworks were incredible you can definitely achieve everything you need to in one day if thats all you can spare ,5,2018-12-30
1519,"Finally, the Original!",since i live in florida i have been to disneyworld almost times over my years here raising a family this was my first trip to disneyland though yes it is smaller but that does not equate to a less satisfying experience at all we loved the differences and were comfortable with the similarities the monorail is somewhat confusing here but the train ride is actually more entertaining with the additional environments such as the dinosaur exhibit it feels just as exciting and my grandaughters were absolutely enthralled there is a notable addition which we do not have in florida the new orleans square since i live in the french quarter for a number of years i was interested in seeing how authentic it was wonderfully it is very authentic we had an excellend meal at cafe orleans and the buildings and environment was authentic the cast members woorking the entrance to cafe orleans left a lot to be desire but once inside or on the patio the experience was amazing overall disneyland is very special ,5,2018-12-30
1520,Great time for the holiday season,this was my th trip to disneyland and probably one of the best we made great use of maxpass to fastpass the popular rides and hopped on the other rides in between the park was quiet in the am and some evenings as well staff were friendly and the photographers were amazing we made good use out of our photopass from the maxpass well worth the money loved the christmas decorations and the overall holiday atmosphere in both parks by using the app and maxpass i feel we optimized our time in the park to the best of our ability and walked away feeling like we accomplished what we wanted to do we were lucky and there were not too many ride closures and most that happened were very temporary looking forward to coming back to the park again sometime ,5,2018-12-30
1521,Disneyland Holiday.,always a great time at disneyland although we were really disappointed when they cancelled the fireworks due to weather which was a load of rubbish as it was clear and hardly a breath of wind at the time of cancellation they left us standing there for over an hour before they told us i took a screen shot that said clear and wind of km per hour ,3,2018-12-30
1522,2 yr old 1st visit!,no need to write about disneyland itself instead i will focus on our experience with my yr old daughter who came to disney for the first time parking allow extra time to park over christmas break we arrived around am it took us about mins from the time we entered the exit for disney to the time we were actually inside the park you have a massive backup to pay the parking guy then line to actually park then you need to walk to the security gate then you need to take the tram to the park finally you have a small line to get inside food it s expensive but you already know that i saw a bunch of people bringing in their own food we didn t know that i don t know if it would have mattered since we wouldn t want to bring a cooler they have kids options at the food court but not much chicken tenders mac cheese etc rides we got the fast pass but we re rookies on the strategy to use them you can only book one fast pass every mins we should have booked one when we arrive since lines for rides were lighter by the time we booked alot of the good slots were filled crowds after got really big plan your rides accordingly since wait times nearly doubled or in some cases tripled it didn t matter too much for us since our daughter wasn t going on most rides we did the easy rides nemo sub tour its underwater we liked it and thought it was cute my daughter didn t she got scared of the dark parts and confined space monorail fun to see the entire park it was kind of a short loop it s a small world we all loved this one especially my daughter she was so into it it s a boat ride with lots to see we did the fast pass on this one definitely worth it otherwise you will be waiting a while parade parades go about twice a day beware of the times you could get stuck on either side of the parade route and will have to wait to cross it s fun to watch if you have the time general crowds are lighter in morning they are noticably heavier in afternoon get the big rides done early staff everyone was super friendly not unexpected they really want you to have a good time and will take the time to answer any questions ,5,2018-12-30
1523,Be a kid for a day!!,wow what an amazing place disneyland is it is beautifully done and so well organised that it runs like clockwork we purchased a two day park hopper for disneyland park and disney california adventure park it was not cheap but was worth every cent both parks are brilliant but we enjoyed disneyland park the best the highlights were the main street parade and the fireworks over the enchanted castle both events were crowded even though it was outside the main holiday period the only lowlight was the queues for every ride we did a couple of rides but gave up on the rest because we didn t want to spend hours queueing even the priority fastpass did not help much experienced disneyland visitors told us there is a technique to using the fastpass but we did not figure it out until it was too late maybe disneyland should run a how to talk for first timers like us maybe they do the food was excellent with plenty of options and the merchandise was amazing we spent a lot of time buying for our kids and grandkids it was enjoyable and satisfying although we couldn t find woody clothing anywhere they had run out apparently which seems odd disney staff were amazingly helpful and courteous it s obvious that customer service is a top priority we have done it now and probably won t be able to visit again but our kids and grandkids will we hope so anyway ,5,2018-12-29
1524,Be still my heart!,there is no place quite like disneyland an amazing adventure for the whole family to enjoy make sure you take lots of spending money and lots of patience long lines and strollers can do your head in so many treats rides and wonderful memories to be made,5,2018-12-29
1525,Prior Planning Important,disneyland is still the happiest place on earth but nowadays navigating the park successfully requires strategic planning which is a bit of a let down to accept the fast pass situation can be confusing if it s your first time so read up on the best way to utilize that feature ahead of your visit posted wait times are pretty accurate but can change quickly even if you make a game plan you have to be flexible based on the current wait times best rides per our family consensus indiana jones big thunder mountain space mountain star wars food meh didn t really find any recommendable eateries ,4,2018-12-29
1526,Disneyland on Christmas Day,we knew that disneyland on christmas day would be busy but it really wasn t that bad the rest of the week got crazy busy you could hardly move around the park you just moved with the flow of people yes lines were long we were a group of with two strollers so it wasn t easy to move around we have been to disney before and always had a wonderful time this time we met many more crabby pushy people also many of the workers were not very friendly which is so unusual for disney we did however meet some wonderful helpful workers out max passes saved us from having a bad week because without them the lines would be huge it seemed like there were less disney workers around the food prices are just horrible i knew they were high but i didn t remember them being that high all in all we had a good four days there but it was crowded pricey and not as well run as it used to be ,4,2018-12-29
1527,2 days of ‘fun’?,ok admit it first timer to disneyland must have been timing but knew from day ie getting into the car park this was going to be a lesson in queuing mins just to queue for the car park once in smoothly guided to a parking spot tram to park then into the park now la disney is made up of two parks day one hit the main park fantasyland etc and day two the adventure park pixar pier etc both days when we visited were both super busy we had younger children so luckily none of the big kids rides but still the teacups etc busy expect queues running into mins yes get a fast pass but it made no sense with small kids recommend the shows ariels adventure frozen live show mickey s magic show as ones to go for my kids loved them and they rested my feet ,4,2018-12-29
1528,Horrible experience,we took our grandsons to disneyland for the day while in la for a short stay to bring in the new year we paid in excess of for tickets for one park disneyland and we paid the extra for the maxpass to avoid long lines the cost was never an issue as we have been to disneyworld in fla many times and realize that while it is expensive it was always worth it for the memories and the experience the only memories we are going to bring away from our visit to disneyland are going to be off outrageous wait times on every ride and that was after waiting for hours in a line to get through security despite getting there at am the frustration of not being able to use the maxpass because use is severely restricted once we booked our maxpass on one ride we were not allowed to book another for at least hours the reason for this was never given and befuddles me when we were able to book another ride on maxpass there were no times available for hours all in it was a terrible experience and i can say we will never be back thank god we only planned one day for disneyland during our stay otherwise the whole trip would have been a disaster ,1,2018-12-28
1529,"Lines, lines and lines to get into lines.",bring good shoes and be prepared to stand in lines when we arrived at the park gates we had no idea what line to get into as this was our first visit we stood in the magic micky morning gate for an hour only to be greeted by a lady who was right upset with us when we finally made it to the front and told us to get in the common folk line we stood in that line for another hour and finally got in we went on a value day and after clearing almost a quarter of the parks attractions in hours we thought we were doing pretty good after about am though wow did the lines ever grow i am definitely a effort vs reward kind of person and standing in line for hours to enjoy a min ride feels unrewarding we were able to clear most of the park before we left though and the attractions that stood out were pirates of the caribbean gold rush roller coaster haunted house and space mountain the rest were meh another attraction that stood out was mickey s house but for the wrong reasons it s a crazy line just to get in when you finally make it it s another line to walk through as your venturing through the non ac non ventilated house packed with small screaming children and the wonderful hint of peoples b o and farts passing through the air halfway through i started feeling claustrophobic and overheated thank goodness for emergency exits be prepared to drop a good chunk of money for anything extra at the park usd for a slice of pizza is insane theres is also smoking location in the entire park way in the back so if your a smoker good luck if you want to catch the parade start looking for a spot at least an hour before also better to ask someone if its ok to be where you are as you might be sitting for a hour only to be told you can t be there same for the fireworks which were cancelled the day we went all in all i would never go back disneyland bucket list complete but better ways to spend money can only imagine what a zoo this place is on a non value day ,3,2018-12-28
1530,Holidays. Is it worth it?,it s tough with young kids add a ton of people for the holidays and it s very difficult to get to do what you want that said disney does a great job with process and they do the best you can probably get with things the focus on a guests experience is their priority that makes it difficult with the capacity levels of recent years i d be willing to pay significantly more for much less people in the park unfortunately that is the direction the park is going anyone upset that had a bad experience has a legitimate pov i will hold off on returning until my kids can ride all the rides and come on a down time i ve had better experiences and it may just come down to timing ,3,2018-12-28
1531,Disappointed Disappointed,visited for xmas with my kids aged yrs old waited hmin to do the carousel after that waited hr and the q was still at and my daughter said she was tired waiting foe the flying elephants so we left the q we waited hr to order a coffee every ride had notes on saying min etc waiting time the worst spent for a xmas in disneyland and paying for nothing very poorly managed to reduce waiting times disneyland you won t see us ever again ,1,2018-12-28
1532,Christmas visit to Disneyland,we visited dca on christmas eve and disneyland on christmas day wednesday and thursday yes it was busy but totally worth it in my opinion we were still able to get on plenty of rides and partake in a turkey keg for lunch so much to do in this park and even though we have visited a couple of times before we still found some new things to experience our year old was at a great age to enjoy and his favourite ride was astro blasters which we were able to ride about times over the days we were there ,5,2018-12-28
1533,More like a baby stroller convention,i have been to disney world in florida as a child and now i am well into my adulthood i still wanted to hit disnelland for the experience and now that they own franchises like star wars and marvel then it seems like more incentive for me to visit right not really disneyland is a victim of their own success it s way too overcrowded and yes i understand that it s supposed to appease children but the sheer amount of people pushing baby strollers was ridiculous i heard that they allow folks to ride electric scooters that wouldn t be such a bad idea if the walking lanes were not so densely populated the lines to wait on some of the rides at least the ones i wanted to ride were unbearable so my judgement is based on how much i paid to enter versus what i was actually able to enjoy when i was there i keep hearing people say you have to go early so let me get this straight instead of being among the thousands i will be among hundreds that are also early birds if i showed up right when the gates open i could probably squeeze in one more ride but it also meant that i had to stay or so more hours at the park to get in that one extra ride by the time i m finished that i ll be among thousands once again all it means is that i would have to stay there longer and for what you pay it s not really worth it just go if it s something you have to take off your bucket list or if you ve never been to any disney themed park my guess is that they will eventually have a baby stroller museum and daily contest ,2,2018-12-28
1534,Doesn't compare to Magic Kingdom,let s start with the beauty and nostalgia the park is totally on point here you can still feel walt s mark here the christmas versions of haunted mansion and it s a small world are amazing and worth the visit to see this the crowds were horrible but i expected this so i m not going to complain about the crowds but the bathroom situation is not up to par by any standards there are not enough bathrooms for the people to go and it creates an uncomfortable experience for all guests we went to several restaurants that did not have bathrooms in them these were full service restaurants not some rinky dink kiosks that serve snacks as a couple we spent over in one restaurant and for that restaurant not to have a bathroom of its own is shameful all the money that is generated by disney and you don t have restaurants that have bathrooms that s ridiculous i realize that disneyland is smaller than magic kingdom but this country is full of engineers who can design taller buildings to create the space that is necessary to accommodate the larger crowds lastly the christmas parade theme music and the distance between each float was ridiculous you mean to tell me that california does not have high school bands or similar groups that can play music with the different themes of disney throughout the parade so you don t have to repeat the same tune over and over again i live in ohio so it s a long way to go to see disneyland in california i really expected a little bit more than this i should just be happy with what i got but with all the money that is generated by this park they can do better ,3,2018-12-27
1535,Over populated,so many people couldn t even walk around park and hour waits for rides and fast pass check in morning couldn t use tell late evening was not fun very disappointed in the experience ,1,2018-12-27
1536,Old school wonderful,went on christmas eve and it is a magical place much smaller that the parks in florida but very entertaining easier to walk from one end to the other loved the matterhorn can t find that ride in florida fireworks and christmas parade were great walt disney really has a presence here and you can feel it because this is where his dream began ,5,2018-12-26
1537,Christmas gift for my Aunt,my aunt has been to disneyland times but never on christmas day i decided to give her this gift most of the trip was fabulous rides great and most staff were pleasant and helpful on christmas night after the fireworks my aunt and i wanted to get a couple gifts to take home the next day and a picture of the castle lit up at night before leaving the park we went to a good spot to get a picture and a staff member told us to keep walking i was trying to take a picture and stood out of the traffic area and she started yelling st me to take pictures after pm it was at this point she was saying this was a walk way i took my one picture and my aunt didnt get any we started walking towards the store we wanted to go to and another staff person told us we couldn t go there but to keep walking i said we want to get a souvenir and she said it didnt matter but to keep walking so we kept going till we got to another store that sold souvenirs and again a staff person told us to keep walking out of the park i said again we wanted to go in a store and she said we could but she refused to let us walk on the side walk to the store behind her my aunt and i ended up shopping at the gift shop in our hotel howard johnson for a couple things that said disney i thought maybe the park was closing at so before we left the gate at the park i asked the guard said no it was open till midnight i told him about the staff in the park and how we couldn t shop he said there were a few people complaining of the same thing so perhaps these ladies who were directing traffic should not be working at the happiest place in the world they didnt fit in and tainted my otherwise memorable experience with my dad and aunt ,4,2018-12-26
1538,Disneyland favorite since 1957,having been coming here since times in all from washington state love it but the golden horse review needs to go back to what it was not very entertaining anymore just a short stop for lunch and a few minutes of mediocre stage entertainment please bring back the people mover need something to help take the load off the railroad we all need a place like the train and people mover to just sit and relax and still see the sights food is getting way too expensive knotts berry farm still has decent prices the security lines getting into the park can be overwhelming need to modernize and expedite the process faster ,5,2018-12-26
1539,Fun but learned a few lessons,make this quick maxpass it schedule the rides try to do the early in times as well prepare for rude people after pm lots of stroller road rage try to keep your family safe next time we know but i think i will wait another year before returning we will try california adventure this summer ,2,2018-12-25
1540,Nice park,we ve been to walt disney world hundreds of times we were in the area and we decided to come here we weren t disappointed the park was crowded and expensive which was expected the walkways were also very narrow which isn t shocking because the place was designed nearly years ago the park is a lot of fun for a small space they pack in a lot of rides shows and characters i don t like paying for fastpass but the maxpass system did make it possible for us to ride well over a dozen rides in a day and a half it is worth coming here even if you ve been to other disney parks ,5,2018-12-24
1541,Disneyland Secrets,ok so everyone knows about disneyland but they probably don t know everything go ahead and read disneyland secrets it tells all ,4,2018-12-23
1542,Long Lines,omg talk about walking and long lines this was a long day we spent hours at the two parks walking and mainly waiting on long lines we tried to time each ride with fast pass but your not allowed to book two in a row bummer had to wait on most attractions for at least hour but gotta say it was worth it not so much for haunted maison more for the little kids it was a full day of walking waiting time to rest ,4,2018-12-23
1543,Don't bother,we paid dollars per person for the fast pass and used the app the app allows you to sign up for appointments for the busy rides but it doesn t tell you that the ride is broken down for the day the best rides were broken down including the haunted mansuon space mountain and star tours my father is disabled and the accommodations for people with mobility problems are poor my family won t be returning ,1,2018-12-22
1544,Just amazing,we had a four day pass which i think was perfect for our family of with a and year old the staff everywhere were always helpful and polite the good at the outlets was all good quality with healthy options available it was always worth getting to the park close to opening am waiting time very minimal by am lines were getting very long ,5,2018-12-22
1545,Believe the hype,amazing day at disneyland even with older children we all had an absolute blast getting through all the rides we could and meeting as many characters as possible wow a day we will all remember for the rest of our lives ,5,2018-12-21
1546,Celebrating Friend's 1st Visit,never a bad day at disney was great to see a year old man laugh and smile he loved haunted mansion and candy cane beignets ,5,2018-12-21
1547,Such a fun place to visit! A MUST if you're in the area,disneyland is incredible it is busy but that is only because it is a small theme park we went in november so crowds were lower but it was still moderately busy the staff are great if you re ever in la i highly recommend taking a few days out to visit disney buy your tickets elsewhere and not at the gate they are more expensive ,5,2018-12-21
1548,Girlfriends Birthday!,always awesome and fun and it wasn t too packed on the th or th of dec the weather was perfect as well ,5,2018-12-20
1549,Marvelous experience,disneyland can certainly get crowded and the lines can be very long for certain rides however something this good and enjoyable is bound to attract hordes of people and deservedly so anyway the fastpass is the best way to see the more popular rides such as space mountain star tours and splash mountain i used those passes and was on and off the rides in less than minutes in many instances this saved significant amounts of time and if you want to good soaking be sure to ask for the first carriage in splash mountain otherwise i highly recommend the main street parade at pm the fireworks display at pm and fantasmic at pm ,5,2018-12-20
1550,Majestic!!!,the most amazing place to take young children what stood out so much for me was the incredibly happy staff always so friendly happy and accommodating clean and tidy second to nothing i ve ever seen not a piece of litter anywhere well placed restrooms and eating areas so well structured and organized brilliantly run a fun filled day for the whole family ,5,2018-12-20
1551,Great Fun!!!,the staple of disney in california very very crowded even on weekdays during the school year do not miss the food at the excellent blue bayou restaurant which is spectacular even though you will have to sell your first born to be able to afford it just exaggerating my favorite ride was pirates of the caribbean the lines waiting to get on the other most magnificent rides were just too long suggest you go in the early morning at opening and try to get some of the too limited fast passes that quickly disappear as the park gets more crowded ,5,2018-12-20
1552,Super Time,this park was hours of walking but had a whole day of things to do we enjoyed all of it the only wish i wouldn t have done wait minutes for peter pan i should have done the winnie the pooh ride x instead clean fun and a full fun day experience ,5,2018-12-19
1553,Amazing place!,this is literally the happiest place on earth full of amazingness everywhere you look highly recommend the fast pass is worth every single dollar to avoid the wait times staff are so polite and helpful splash mountain is the best we also did the breakfast character dining which was so good so many photo opportunities and they spend plenty of time at each table plus you get early access to the park ,5,2018-12-19
1554,Truely the most magical place on earth,truely the most magical place on earth back to being a child main street and my favorite it s a small world ,5,2018-12-19
1555,Wow,please go week day monday thursday very average during the daytime just my opinion but at night just wow all my childhood dreams came true the lights shows entertainment and people again just wow ,5,2018-12-18
1556,It's Disney... Of course is magical,we always love disney but this past trip the cast members were a big disappointment we had so many rude cm s and it really dampened our trip ,4,2018-12-18
1557,TOO Many People!!,i bought a day pass online since there was a deal for canadians however it was soooo overly crowded that my teenaged son couldn t take it so we left after an hour my husband and i went on our own the next day we waited in a long line to go through security another long line to go through the entrance once we got inside it was hrs to wait to use our fastpass it was so crowded we bumped into people constantly there was nothing enjoyable about this at all we went back again with our soon at monday morning to try again and the crowds built up pretty quickly already an hour wait for fastpass so we left after an hour disney needs to limit the amount of people it lets in no one looked very happy to me when people spend lots of money with prepaid tickets and travel far they should be able to enjoy themselves ,1,2018-12-17
1558,Loved it!,had a wonderful time was not too crowded rides were loads of fun well worth the trip fulfilled all my childhood dreams highly recommend for all the family ,4,2018-12-17
1559,Great family holiday,great family vacation great for all ages we had family members from age to was great for everyone ,5,2018-12-17
1560,The original park is the best!,i think that adults reviewing this park need to remember it is for kids i went in february and just loved the aroma of all the beauifull flowers and although i went on a midnight trip on a special evening i was struck by how many youg parents were there with their strollers not all the rides are great but here are many to pick aqnd choose from friendly staff who work there prices for some of the refreshments can be a bit high but overall you will not starve everyone should go at least once ,5,2018-12-17
1561,"It's Disneyland, Of Course it's AWESOME!",expensive but worth it fun rides for all saw the christmas parade which was spectacular can t wait to go back ,5,2018-12-17
1562,The truth,rides average attractions slightly above average food average but way overpriced cost expensive fire works amazing third time is easier than the first recommend getting the lay of the park before visiting make use of the app and the max pass get there early but definitely don t stay the entire day take a break around for lunch outside or a nap then head back around to finish off whatever you missed stay for the fireworks don t leave immediately after that s what everyone is doing strollers are good for young ones but carriers might be easier fast pass is more like a reservation system stay on top of it to make the most of the trip also use the picture link in the app easier than buying the pictures in the end the kids have a good time that s what matters right lol have fun ,3,2018-12-17
1563,LOVE DISNEY!!,so worth the price to our family the memories made were unforgettable and we are already ready to go back ,5,2018-12-16
1564,Not the “happiest place”,everyone knows the tag line disney but it is only true the first time you visit for a few hours this place is absolutely overpriced and ridiculously crowded i took my kids because we did not want them to be left out as their friends talked about it but after the first day it was just another theme park the wait times from the rides for a minute ride to the bathrooms are just too much once the ooh and aah wears off you notice how tired people are and most adults are not smiling at all by early afternoon you will also see a lot of tantrums from exhausted kids and a few parents too lol ,3,2018-12-16
1565,Still the best Disney park because it is the Original,the park is still timeless and always the best to visit as not so overwhelming as the other larger parks we always have a great time visiting disneyland and this time was no exception ,5,2018-12-16
1566,Crazy crowded but beautiful,we went expecting a crowd but my goodness there were a lot of people in the park however i don t think it s realistic to expect to visit disneyland in december and avoid a crowd we arrived at am purchased maxxpasses and used them the passes are helpful for riding the rides with the longest waits our favorite ride by far was indiana jones i would skip the parade unless i had little girls with me instead head to a popular ride and take advantage of the lull in traffic staying at a hotel with a shuttle was a definite plus ,5,2018-12-16
1567,Max Pass Good BUT Room For Improvement,we recommend the hopper passes if you are mobile enough we maximized the number of adult rides when we used the max pass to book fast passes in the other park when we were entering a ride this gave us time to go on one ride book another and walk onto a ride without a pass and then walk over to the other park we checked the line up times online on the app to ensure we did not waste time lining up we used our steps to walk between parks instead by day we were going on our favourite rides for a second and third time we also found the restrooms were bigger nicer and newer in cap the fireworks were amazing and worth staying for they start at pm sharp and last minutes secure a spot with a view of the castle we feel the front of the line pass at universal is superior to the max fast pass at disney but the superior one is at least times more expensive we found wednesday to be the best day to get on rides with short or non existent line ups the indiana jones ride fast pass line is not that great compared to other rides it still takes awhile to get on the ride the mexican restaurant was our favourite place to eat lunch cafeteria style with plenty of seating ,4,2018-12-15
1568,Very long day but fit most in,my tween and teen spent a full day to pm we couldn t keep going for the fire works after arriving from australia the day prior fast pass is a must took own waters and snacks catering is expensive as you d expect especially with the aussie dollar being so low ,5,2018-12-15
1569,Magical,just like walking into a story book we visited when the park was at half capacity and really did not wait for any length of time for attractions although grab a spot early to get a good look at the main street parade and fireworks are well worth the wait in the evening if you have teens that like rides then be sure to grab a fast pass for the rocky mountineer railroad rollercoaster and space mountain although food inside the park is a bit pricey my advice would be to hop on the free monorail at frontierland it will drop you off at downtown just outside both parks where you have lots of affordable options for dining especially with kids just be prepared for lots of crowds inside the park it s inevitable plan out your day and fit in as much as you can ,5,2018-12-15
1570,Fun day out,it was a fun day out but the rides are mostly for younger children do not take camera stands or gopro sticks my expensive equipment got confiscated at the entrance and they didn t let me collect it afterwards and told me it gets destroyed immediately nonetheless fun day especially during christmas time ,4,2018-12-15
1571,"Long queues, not many thrill rides for teeneagers",queues for the most thrilling rides were between min and an hour december th i m sure if you have young children this theme park might be ok but teenagers quickly run out of rides that interest them and having to wait too long really discourages plus the time it takes to get between them is overous i ve been to all the theme parks in australia and been very happy but would have to say disneyland was overhyped and under delivered from my perspective one day is all you will need for teenagers particlularly if they are or older don t fall for the trap of going for days as you won t get a refund if you are dissatisfied and don t want to use the nd day it just takes so long to get things done there very dissappointed ,1,2018-12-14
1572,It's Disneyland!!,growing up in florida i was comparing disneyland to disney world and i will say disneyland comes out on top though it is a smaller park the rides especially the original rides pirates haunted mansion small world are way better invest in the maxpass even if you don t use it for rides getting all of your photos from the professionals in the park is totally worth it ,5,2018-12-13
1573,Disneyland,don t know where to start too many rides but my favorite ones were big thunder mountain space mountain and the matterhorn bobsled a bit overpriced but amazing ,5,2018-12-12
1574,Amazing,i love disney and i was worried about bringing my year old daughter to the park completely amazing she was so happy that we did not have melt downs love disney ,5,2018-12-12
1575,Family Holiday,a wonderful experience especially for the grandkids under disney is really where dreams come true the grandkids went on as many rides and attended as many shows as possible and still had energy for more the park met all the family requirements when coupled with california adventure adults and children we had a day pass to both parks which gave us plenty of opportunity to enjoy all that disney has to offer before you go research the fast pass process as it will make your life much more pleasant and reduce wait times on many rides soarin the world at california adventure is a must for all the family there is so much to do at disney and california adventure that a day pass is mandatory with the culmination at disney being the fireworks and snow show at around pm each night not to be missed ,5,2018-12-12
1576,Overcrowded on weekend days & a monday.,we love disney we love wdw we love the fact you can t book fastpasses before you enter the park as it is a fair system be prepared for long waits for popular rides if you don t use maxpass we didn t see radiator springs drop below a minute wait and saw it over minute wait at one point some people with prams strollers use them as battering rams to get through the crowds so watch your legs and it gets very congested in certain areas try and go mid week and avoid the crowds and use max pass then you ll get on more rides we d go back but never on a weekend day again ,4,2018-12-12
1577,over prized but still magical place,don t even know where to start we have been to many disneylands and wanted to try out the original for once entrance prize already made me quiver but i thought hey it s disney so we even bought the max pass to it which was a great investment btw the first day it was raining like crazy it s of course not disneys fault however they still sold their ponchos for like the one my mom had bought already broke minutes later it s crazy it was raining so strong that several rides couldn t go anymore and the parades had to be cancelled so why not at least give the visitors who still had to pay full entrance fee the ponchos for free or at least will never understand their motivations in this as to the max pass one thing i realised here was that a few of the photographers had absolutely no intention to work their best they seemed half heartedly especially the one at meeting mickey and only took a few photos without even checking how they would turn out in the end we got a couple of blurred ones whereas my own camera would have done better ones for sure we also encountered good ones the one at the sword of excalibur even went to his colleague with me as he had several ideas for my posing at this photo spot the max pass sure saved us several minutes at several rides it was easy with the app however some people might think it s stressful because you have to plan your day following the given fast passes our second day at disney was a friday during early christmas time so it was packed knew that before but what annoyed me was the fact that all restaurants were full and the big ones did not even allow walk ins anymore i had the feeling that annual pass holders were given priority and without doing a very early reservation you didn t stand a chance to eat in a comfortable place i checked the app as early as september that s when i found out it existed and downloaded it and most of the restaurants were already gone from the list of reservations there were huge lines everywhere even one week later i am dreaming about standing in line the magic of disneyland was gone that afternoon completely gone only during the amazing firework it came back but left again as we had to squeeze out of the park with like millions of other people however i need to give the park points because nevertheless most of them are doing there best and it is disneyland the most magic event was that my mom lost an earring the first day in the torrential rain and it has been found i d like to think it was pure disney magic ,4,2018-12-12
1578,Great Day!,my boyfriend and i went to disneyland on saturday from around pm to pm we bought the max pass for per person and were able to get wonderful pictures of us both as well as ride every ride we wanted to which is usually unheard of when you go on a saturday during the holidays the parade was beautiful and it was just a great day ,5,2018-12-12
1579,Happiest place Ipoh Earth !!!!,hi gang come and explore the wonders of disney bring lots of money my credit card is still smoking ,5,2018-12-11
1580,Max Pass is Ruining Disneyland and California Adventure Park!,we just went to disneyland and california adventure park for my grandson s th birthday we stayed at the disneyland hotel nights and bought day park hopper tickets for people i was asked in advance if we wanted a max pass but since we were taking a year old for his first time i thought it would be impossible to make set times although disneyland seemed pretty fair and the max pass fast pass guests were filtered into the lines rather invisibly when we visited california adventure park we felt completely second class at cars we got in line with a minute wait the ride had technical difficulties and delays so those of us in the offensive stand by lane got pushed back and watched line after unlimited line of max pass people go ahead of us with the old fast pass system there was a limit per hour but the max pass seems to be without regulation and those of us without have to wait and wait as stand by even though we paid for full price park hoppers the ride was great then we went to goofy sky school and the same thing happened max pass over crowd a minute wait went to and we just gave up we ended up leaving the park after rides ,4,2018-12-11
1581,Great,had a great time with my daughter yes it can be a little pricey but it is worth the memories that she would help with your family child spouse or significant other,5,2018-12-11
1582,Disabled senior,okay so i went on my probably last trip to disneyland ca i m and have been going to disneyland since i was six absolutely my favorite theme park hands down this trip however was my first time since becoming partially disabled i can sit stand and walk but only for about a minute i checked out wheelchair accessibility and was pleasantly surprised they have manual and electric wheelchairs w c at the park how cool i rented an electric w c i think it was and well worth it i didn t want my wife or daughter to push me around perhaps taking away their enjoyment the w c rental area is right near the entrance and of course great cast members there to assist i was very self conscious about being in a w c to begin with but these cast members made me feel so welcome and relieved all of my anxieties in fact all cast members were way over the top accommodating not to mention the electric w c could just about burn rubber i had been very well briefed on the w c operation when i rented it very easy mechanics a two year old could operate it but was definitely impressed with its speed it certainly was faster than a person can walk after a full day of zipping around i had barely dented the battery charge when going on a ride cast members would direct us to where we should go it was better than having a fast pass with every ride the cast members would ask if i could walk stand etc usually entertaining a ride from its exit once on the ride the cast would take my w c to where i d be getting off the ride ie i went in the regular entrance to the tiki room and the cast took my w c to the exit my only problem was people walking in front of me i would have to slow down so i wouldn t hit someone if they stopped suddenly all in all it was a great experience and i owe all that to disney cast members they made me feel wanted welcome and released any anxiety i had of feeling like i was a burden thank you to these cast members who made my probably last visit to the park one of my best visits ever so anyone putting disneyland on the no fly list because of disability remove it ,5,2018-12-11
1583,Great place for a 40th Birthday!,i treated my two daughters to a long weekend in s california to celebrate my oldest daughter s th birthday we spent most of our time at the magic kingdom i have never been to california adventure we thoroughly enjoyed our time there ,5,2018-12-11
1584,Never enough time,we had a great trip the week before thanksgiving was busy but manageable stayed days and still felt so rushed wish we had more time great place to take the kids for the holidays ,5,2018-12-11
1585,Amazing time.,make sure to plan ahead of time on what rides you will be doing and where they are to maximize your fun at the park ,5,2018-12-11
1586,Very few and boring vegan options for my family,i can t believe a world of dreams and love supports cruelty exploitation or hell to innocent animals who don t want to live or die for human taste sorry i want to teach my girl a world of compassion is possible but it was really hard to offer her vegan options at the park there are vegan hot dogs burgers pizza etc why can t they have them there i mean everything there is already pricey so a buck more for compassion food wouldn t hurt other than that it was magical for my year old girl she got to be there at mickey s birthday ,1,2018-12-11
1587,The Happiest Place on Earth!,my wife and i usually take the kids to disneyland at least once a year the thing that sets disneyland apart from any other theme park is that the staff are truly cast members from the time they come from backstage to where the public are they are actors from those that are portraying a character all the way to the groundskeepers each one of them is there to make your day better and to show you kindness there is such a remarkable difference because of the attitude of the staff the grounds are kept meticulously clean and everyone is so kind the true spirit of service and gratitude is abundant ,5,2018-12-11
1588,Fun,lots of fun but much smaller than disney world went on a rainy day and could ride all rides with shorter lines wonderful ,3,2018-12-10
1589,Disneyland Park,spent days with my year old daughter she had an amazing time definately needed the days it certainly is the happiest place on earth super friendly staff exceptionally clean and plenty for everyone of all ages ,5,2018-12-10
1590,AP Review,grew up coming to disneyland at least once a year now as an adult living in the wet pnw disneyland saves me from the grungy winters in seattle ,5,2018-12-10
1591,First time with grandson,what a great day we had we did so much before because we had a great guide our grandson is only and we where amazed at how well behaved he did ,5,2018-12-10
1592,Fun for the whole family,definitely worth it to get the two or three day park hopper and get the max pass to bypass the lines and free downloads of all the pictures from rides and photo ops throughout the park kids absolutely loved their trip to disneyland and california adventure park this was our first trip that both kids were tall enough to ride almost all of the rides great birthday experience for my youngest and family fun ,5,2018-12-09
1593,Fun evening! Lots of choices to fit everyone.,we loved visiting everyone found something they loved and made choices according to their own preferences loved the lemon flavored soft serve ice cream at california adventures ,4,2018-12-09
1594,A big kid at heart,had an amazing days at disneyland cant wait to go again i just don t understand why people give any less than five stars for a rating for disneylanl really i read one review they gave one star because it rained i really don t think disneyland organize that someone else gave one star here because they queued for rides i just can t believe that ,5,2018-12-09
1595,Great but expensive day,this place isn t cheap don t ever think doing a day at disney will be a cheap day that said it s worth the price everything is over the top and such a great experience for the whole family the food is amazing and the staff are all outstanding i ve been going for decades and now i take my kid i can t wait for the new star wars portion but i m sad that big thunder ranch was closed it had the best dinner in the park ,5,2018-12-09
1596,Everything closes with rain,we went to dineyland but it happened to be raining many rides and shows were cancelled we even tried to go to breakfast at the rose and that had delayed opening really a disappointing visit,2,2018-12-09
1597,A little disappointed,we have been here a couple of times and thought the atmosphere around halloween was amazing so we had high expectations of christmas time i think because we had been to orlando we are now disappointed with the atmosphere and scale of disneyland so many people not a lot of christmas decorations and songs and the rides were too long to wait for if you are contemplating between this and disney world i d take orlando for sure ,3,2018-12-08
1598,Great time,great place even in the rain glad we took two pairs of shoes most lines are inside with things to see ,5,2018-12-08
1599,Beautiful,it s way smaller than orlando s park but the kids loved it and i enjoyed the time with the family and the shows and attractions were good,5,2018-12-07
1600,our 4th disney park worldwide and the best,we can t explain how much we enjoyed it arrive early and it will benefit you so much crowds can get a little crazy,5,2018-12-07
1601,Thanksgiving 2018,it was a bit crowded but worth every line all the waiting truly the most magical place on earth our kids ages first trip they thoroughly enjoyed themselves fun for the entire family ,5,2018-12-07
1602,Nothing like it!!,i never thought i would do it but when in los angeles i just had to go it was quite an amazing experience that truly was a delight for kids and adults alike the performers were clearly very accomplished artists staff were amazingly well trained and helpful at last i ve done it and wasn t disappointed ,5,2018-12-06
1603,Really is the happiest place on earth,had an amazing days at disneyland cant wait to go again my kids loved it if you want to hire a motorised scooter make sure to get in early as they run out unfortunately we had to use the medical facilities as my daughter was quite sick and the medics were amazing as was the first aid facility ,5,2018-12-06
1604,We loved it!!,the happiest place on earth lived up to the saying amazeballs clean polished a every turn we were amazed food was the only let down overpriced and very american strange that ,5,2018-12-06
1605,Great time to visit Disney!,it is worth traveling to disney off season weeks are cheaper in cost and waited no more than minutes for rides ,5,2018-12-06
1606,Its Disneyland!,hard to not like disneyland if you want to go on rides fast passes are great especially with older kids and the roller coasters there are crowds but everyone is excited to be there ,5,2018-12-05
1607,Disneyland as expected,long lines long wait and wall to wall people is what to expect while i have been to disneyland several times as i lived only miles from it the increase in prices and the long waits seems overdone you just don t get what you used to in the early days while there were a couple of new rides that i have not been on i would say disneyland is only a once in year visit ,3,2018-12-05
1608,Happiest Place on Earth,we went december and thought we may avoid crowds but were wrong however the trip was amazing sights rides food disneyland is a fantastically magical place we had ages from to and loved every minute our year old girls especially loved the bibbidy bobbidy salon and treatment make reservations that transformed them into princesses the older kids loved the roller coasters splurge and get the max pass for bucks to get preference in lines and we all loved the parade get there minutes early on the street to get a spot and the snow after fireworks ,5,2018-12-05
1609,Disney - what more can you say,magic and well done food was actually better and more reasonable than i expected the fast passes really help too,5,2018-12-04
1610,It IS the Happiest Place on Earth,disneyland is always fun step in and leave the world outside the disney app is very helpful max pass allows you to manage your time it includes digital versions of photos taken by their photographers some of the restaurants offer allergy free menus which describe in details which foods are safe for specific allergies last week they made it snow in fantasyland or course ,5,2018-12-04
1611,First time,first time visiting disneyland it is small and quaint compared to disney world the christmas decorations were really beautiful we went after our convention using twilight tickets we purchased from the hotel i was really shocked at how crowded it was on a thursday night still had a nice time loved how downtown disney is within walking out of the parks and you are right there also took a stroll through disney grand californian hotel and that place was beautiful as well definitely looking forward to going back with the family next time ,4,2018-12-03
1612,Lots of fun!,the park was packed last week although it usually should be quite the kids had lots of fun the fatasmic show was very good ,5,2018-12-03
1613,watch out your payment and credit card,well we got annual membership and paid in full but without knowing there were month of charge every month for same credit card i called to check what is going i was transferred different customer service and they didn t know anything about it i dispute through my bank still is not resolve yet ,1,2018-12-02
1614,Christmas Disneyland,we don t travel often enough so when we do we like terrific experiences disney offers that it s nicely decorated for the season we love that our tips be sure to visit at night it s really neat with the lights and fireworks take a nap midday it seemed so busy then the day we checked out and didn t have a room to go back to the day before we napped and that was really beneficial use the fast pass go early learn which rides to ride in the afternoon when it s so crazy crowded the steamboat the train etc have a good time disneyland is what you take from it ,4,2018-12-02
1615,Happiest place on earth,what s not to live about disney so clean and so well laid out even though there were lineups all things kept moving not a cheap holiday but you do get your moneys worth love this place ,5,2018-12-02
1616,Always happy at Disneyland,coming in the off season is the best choice for sure the lines are short under an hour for most rides surprisingly the park was quieter the sat sun after american thanksgiving the mon was busiest no clue why tues was quieter and wed wasn t bad either don t forget about bag check get in the shortest line as it gets you to the same place california adventure is across the way from disneyland so getting a park hopper is highly recommended as guardian s of the galaxy tower of terror and incredicoaster california screamin is there download the disneyland app on your phone for ride time park hours etc make some memories stay for the fireworks but come early and it fills up and it s only about mins if fireworks aren t your thing ride lines are short,5,2018-12-01
1617,Just Disney,as always disney has something for everyone no matter the age we all had a fantastic day even the the rain couldn t t mar the day ,5,2018-12-01
1618,First Trip,this was our first trip to disneyland after several trips to walt disney world the two parks and the downtown area are very compact and while there is less to do overall the experience is less frantic than wdw during the week the lines are good the weekend is much busier because of local people doing day trips the rides are good but frequently break down compared to wdw if you are hear for multiple days you can work around it but is extremely frustrating if you just spent mins in line just to be turned away downtown area is very limited as the end near the hotels is poised for redevelopment there are currently few dining options the california only attractions are superior to those found at wdw including the incredicoaster and cars ,3,2018-12-01
1619,The happiest place on earth,disneyland is always a fun place to visit but at christmas time it is extra special lots of trees great parade the castle looks great,5,2018-12-01
1620,Happiest Place on Earth,disneyland is a place where memories are made when you start walking down main street your are taken to a whole different place a place where you can be a kid again and you can leave all your worries behind there is something for everyone there if you cant ride rides that s ok because there is so much to look at including shows parades and even train and boat rides don t forget the music as you walk along you might here a jazz band playing in new orleans square or a barber shop quartet singing on main street if you have little kids there are still rides that they can go on as well it really is a magical place that brings our family back time and time again ,5,2018-12-01
1621,Lots of ride closures,we visited the week after thanksgiving as we read that crowds are lower then but we definitely did not find that to be the case the place was packed and unfortunately many of the rides were unexpectedly down for good chunks of the day we really visited to see the haunted mansion because i love the nightmare before christmas overlay but it was closed most of the day we were only able to ride it once space mountain and big thunder mountain experienced intermittent closures throughout the day as well very disappointing we bought the maxpass and we found the disneyland app to be very buggy it kept shutting down then we d have to re enter the password again and again it didn t really matter because by noon almost all the fast passes were gone for the popular rides so i m not sure we got our money s worth we found the same problem as others did aggressive parents steering their mammoth strollers over our feet and into the backs of our legs one parent came straight at me and almost took me out at the knees i really wish they only allowed single file strollers as there were some that sat two or three seats across and they took up the whole sidewalk all in all it was an okay day ,3,2018-11-30
1622,Great family vacation!,we had a wonderful time at disneyland my young daughters really enjoyed their time here and we can t wait to go back and spend more days in the park was not enough you could easily spend a day in each of the lands and still be left wanting more just an excellent family place to go feels so safe and it really brings the magic ,5,2018-11-30
1623,Once in a lifetime visit.,having only visited disneyland paris previously the original disney park completely exceeded my expectations so much more to do here the food is better and the staff seem friendlier also we got engaged here so i obviously have a new favourite disney park ,5,2018-11-30
1624,Original So Cal Fun Zone,went with friends who had not visited the park in over eight years the park app is very useful for wait times and planning your ride attack didn t have to wait more than thirty minutes to get on any ride longest ride was it s a small world listed as sixty minutes but got on in fifty i only go to the park every other year or so but when i do it s still a treat and i always have a great time ,5,2018-11-30
1625,Makes Me Feel Like A Kid Again!,had a tremendous weekend we especially enjoyed all of the christmas decorations the park was crowded but we used the max pass app and were able to ride everything we wanted ,5,2018-11-29
1626,The original,first visit to disneyland although have been to wdw several times really nice park all the best attractions of world without the humidity will definitely be our disney go to from now on ,5,2018-11-29
1627,Mixed experience,the good beautiful park with lots of decorations and attention to detail fun rides with great theming lots of delicious junk food many photo opportunities for family and friends buy the maxpass and be sure to scan your code and collect the id numbers the bad lack of space to match the crowd they allow to enter the park your feet will get stepped on and people will bump you even as you try to dodge them a couple of the worst were when a woman hit me with her stroller from behind as we were walking in the same direction and when a man stepped directly on my foot while crossing the walkway we went with annual pass holders who said it can be even more crowded at other times we went mid week non holiday i went to rope drop one morning and that was even worse for crowds and people trampling others they simply cannot manage the crowds they allow to enter the park a quick announcement of no running on the loud speaker is not enough to stop people from running the staff have zero power to maintain much semblance of order though they do try their best lots of unscheduled ride closures lasting from an hour to most all day haunted mansion jungle cruise space mountain peter pan thunder mountain in addition to the scheduled maintenance closures it smelled like a sewer near adventureland like let s just say a city subway near future land and some other unpleasant odors in random spots maybe their plumbing needs an update maybe they have people throwing dirty diapers in the trash bins and they need to empty them more quickly it wasn t even very hot out so i can t imagine the smell in the summer overall i had a great time having fun with friends but i can t say i m eager to return to the parks and that surprises me ,3,2018-11-29
1628,Never gets old ... though I do do!,fun time and they are very efficient and moving the crowds around get a fast pass on you phone for some of the rides to save time and energy ,5,2018-11-29
1629,Amazing weekend,amazing small easy to navigate with all the wonderful magical feeling you need wonderful small town feel best food seems better than disney world ,5,2018-11-28
1630,Son’s 26th Birthday!!!,disneyland is still the happiest place on earth so true especially at the holiday season they just changed over the decorations in november to christmas from halloween and it was more awesome then i remembered during the night is the best shows and disney parade and snow music and the finally is fireworks at get to the main street early as must ,5,2018-11-28
1631,Great park! its the happiest place on earth...,went there with my wife and toddler my son really enjoyed the rides and he was only years old we finished the park in around hours went back to the hotel for a late afternoon nap and back in the evening for the fireworks overall good service good rides food is more expensive as expected same with the souvenirs as well fastpass is definitely needed if you want to maximize your stay,5,2018-11-27
1632,"Smaller than DisneyWorld, but great experience",castle was much smaller than disney world rides are all closer together enjoyed meeting princesses star wars characters mickey and friends holiday parade was nice loved fantasmic can still view even if you don t get a fast pass watched fireworks from it s a small world with projection show on the water by fantasmic with a projection show on the water and by the castle with a projection show all of them had snow falling each had their own perspective would recommend the app for online ordering wait times maps photographer locations character locations fast passes photo code and more ask for special magic photos where tinker bell shows up in the palm of your hand etc ,5,2018-11-26
1633,Magical Place,everything about it fun and exciting you ll have to do there for at least three days to see everything ,4,2018-11-26
1634,"Disneyland, USA",buy your tickets in advance if you plan to visit disneyland souvenirs are not cheap better to buy at disney outlets instead but the selection may be limited any hotels nearby will require at least mins walk unless you stay at disneyland resort hotel there is a long queue in the morning and you have to pass through security checks before you reach the entrance of either park be prepared to spent at least hours in each park alot of distance to cover not forgetting the queueing time for rides unless you manage to get the express pass that is available free of charge for some rides ,4,2018-11-26
1635,Really is a place of magic,the max pass on the disney app is definitely worth the money we did the park hopper since it was our second time and we only wanted to hit a couple of rides in disneyland but you really need to plan for a full day at each park to be able to get the most out of it ,5,2018-11-25
1636,1st time for Christmas decorations A+,being from northern ca we ve been able to visit the park with our kids several times but this was a special visit day park hopper veterans weekend i was a little worried about crowds as our dates were set by airline discount days and school holiday we were in the park sun mon we loved all of the holiday decorations and changes to small world haunted mansion took advantage of a few holiday treats and were amazed at the park castle transformation max pass made riding rides doable my year old daughter i made the most of our days entering the park right at am and staying until pm we rode rides a day watched fireworks the parade did animation academy and periodically sat on a bench to take it all in great experience ,5,2018-11-25
1637,It's Disneyland!,what can i say it s flippin disneyland the happiest place on earth i ve probably been there times and it never gets old huge biggest advise you can download their official app do it it will give you wait times at all the attractions also you can order food in advance there is an outdoor restaurant in adventureland that has skewers which are great the wait time in line was minutes i ordered in advance on the app showed up and my wait was minutes also pay the extra bucks for the ability to get fast passes through the app i won t explain it here google it but if you re organized it helps a ton we probably got on more rides per day than we would have otherwise you can run around and get fast passes but the app is the way to go ,5,2018-11-25
1638,Disney Vacation,not much needed to say here nobody does it like disney my family loves disneyland of course there us the down sides like crowds long lines and expensive food and tickets but hey this is disneyland and it sells itself ,5,2018-11-25
1639,Grandpa,how can anything beat disneyland every detail is so incredible there is nothing like it it is magical ,5,2018-11-25
1640,Memories!,disneyland is always one of the best trip for our families but i am sure i am not back on thanksgiving weekend over there it was so busy more than summer time ,4,2018-11-25
1641,Great place but some visitors make the line ups very stressful!!,what can i say it s disneyland great place to visit even just to walk around i do like rides so i recommend those for sure line ups were insane and the pass didn t help because you have to wait so long to get on a ride and get can t another pass in the meantime we wasted our money on that one there were also many groups who would have a couple people in the line up and when they got closer to the front all of their other friends and family would budge in front and join them that really shouldn t be allowed and we were bumped back over and over in the line ups because of that argh ,5,2018-11-24
1642,Magical,visited disneyland this morning it is absolutely magic everything is so lovely and so clean the cast members are so incredibly kind helpful and patient we went to a character breakfast the food was yummy best of all the characters came to your table for photos no lines ,5,2018-11-23
1643,Crazy crowded and wait times.,crowds are really bad with wait times between minutes for most of the popular attractions it s still better that california adventure that has wait times between minutes and no fast passes available after noon disney oversells tickets to the extend that it cannot accommodate their visitors at all and just take your money and make you wait hours in lines and you see little in return shameful ,3,2018-11-23
1644,An Always Changing Park,we came here right before thanksgiving and it was amazing to see the park decorated for the holidays it was neat to see how they transformed everything and put the holiday spin on rides shops and restaurants it is important to download the disneyland app the app allows you to add fastpass tickets additional charge to add this feature order food from your app see wait times park maps etc it was so handy for us and made our trip enjoyable you may also spot these fuelrod machines get one for you get a power bank that you can use to charge your phone when you are done simply find a machine and swap out the empty rod for a new one no charge for you overall disneyland is a great place to go know that you will be spending a lot of merchandise and food but it is worth it take a lot of breaks throughout the day ride the train or monorail for a good break and remember you are not going to see do everything in one day be reasonable and have fun ,5,2018-11-23
1645,Mickey's 90th Birthday!,we got the day hopper to enjoy both parks the lines were ridiculous due to it being mickey s birthday we had no idea we thought it would be a good time to go before christmas vacation however we made the best of it by arriving early and staying late you can bring snacks to save money and time while waiting in line also plan your day ahead of time by reading blogs and reviews and take advantage of the fast passes be patient kind ,4,2018-11-22
1646,Great family fun with excellent service,disney s attention to detail and strive for great customer satisfaction is always evident when we visit the parks highly recommend for any disney lovers and families with young kids the magic that the kids have in their eyes when in the park is amazing ,5,2018-11-21
1647,HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!,we had a wonderful days spent park hopping between disney and california parks both so much fun definitely worth getting the fast passes and also going into the single riders lane is worth cutting the wait time down the christmas lights and decorations were amazing along with the beautiful fireworks displays and if you havent tasted eggnog before its a must ,5,2018-11-20
1648,Happiest Place On Earth,believe it beginning when you get in the gates take the train to get a tracks eye view of where and what you want to visit stroll down main street see where walt s apartment is don t forget to a ride on walt s favorite ride before leaving sit down and soak in the experience ,5,2018-11-19
1649,Now they steal your face,you wrote a review for disneyland park minutes ago you buy a ticket but when you get to the entry they require you to have your photo taken now disney s facial recognition database has your picture which they can use or sell go to universal or go to the beach also no discounts for nighttime entry as they used to means you pay roughly per ride since in hours you might get on rides if you are lucky no fast pass if you enter at night because they already gave the slots away earlier ,1,2018-11-19
1650,Disappointed in Customer service and crowds,don t get me wrong i m a huge fan of disneyland but our last experience was extremely frustrating not only was it insanely crowded but we had a three day park hopper pass and on the app it said we had the option to upgrade it to an annual pass by november th we even checked with guest services and they said we could upgrade it until november th at home i went on the app on november th to upgrade our tickets and when i clicked on the upgrade option it had trouble loading then all our tickets disappeared i called disneyland guest services to see what happened and they said i had to upgrade it by the last day of ticket use and there was nothing they could do well that s not what the app said or guest services at the park they were absolutely not helpful at all had the app or guest services said i had until our last day of use to upgrade my tickets you better believe i would ve done it by then but it was very deceitful and the supervisor at guest services didn t make it right at all he said i could pay the full price for annual passes now right after i spent tons of money on day park hopper passes for my family just a few days ago yeah right so beware if you re planning on upgrading your pass to a season pass the date they put on there is very deceitful you have to do it by the last day you re in the park now i know but it s too late and i m very disappointed in the customer service ,1,2018-11-19
1651,AMAZING!,we took our eldest niece here from the moment we waited in line to enter the park we knew this was going to be an experience we ll never forget we did spend a few hours here ash zoe went on a few rides the souvenir shops are plenty there is quality stuff you can buy the star wars section was also great so much different star wars merch to buy in the store we cant wait til when we re back over in la we re going back to disneyland especially to experience galaxy s edge there is alot of walking so be prepared you will need a few days to experience the park fully ,5,2018-11-18
1652,Honest Reveiw,disneyland is amazing it really is i travelled from australia to take my princess loving year old and she has loved every minute the christmas decorations and parades are incredible we purchased the fast passes which are good however not great if you plan to arrive to the park dead on am then there would be advantages you can t pre book any rides on the app until you ve been scanned in at entry we arrived at and queued for quite some time at the bag check by this time ride availability for fast pass on popular rides can t be booked until pm and you can only book one ride at a time so you either risk missing out on a popular ride or just book as many as you can that are available sooner and sometimes that s not many or line up for minutes we were quite annoyed to have booked the indiana jones ride our first day my dad wanted to go on it more than anything so we booked it for the earliest available which was pm and had done this at am meaning we couldn t book others when it was finally our turn the ride has technical troubles and wasn t operating that was frustrating to say the least there are hundreds of strollers and powered scooters to which most of them own the pathways this is not at all disneyland s fault but we were sick of being rammed by both and constantly stepping aside for the arrogant people operating them who have a massive sense of entitlement if you don t adhere to their conditions you will simply get mowed down without them even batting an eyelid my last gripe is that i expected to see characters all day my daughter wanted to meet so many however only certain ones come out everyday for a short amount of time there are massive lines to get your photo and for majority of the them we would get to the back of the line only to be told sorry taking no more come back at x time so that was surprising and disheartening to us as being disneyland we just thought all the characters are out all day to the families with children who are frozen obsessed like my daughter you won t see them at disneyland you have to go to california adventure park clever strategic move by disneyland overall a wonderful time was had and beautiful merchandise is available especially at christmas very expensive but that s to be expected i wanted to provide an honest review so other families travelling quite some distance can know that to expect and possibly not have the moments of disappointment download the disneyland app and familiarise yourself with it prior to arriving once you can work it it s great for getting photos scanned straight to your device and for finding out character locations and times special mention to cinderella who was near the entrance around pm on saturday nov she spoke to my daughter for a while and actually got down on bended knee to her level and had a full conversation with her prior to the photo this absolutely made my daughters day and was just so beautiful of her to do for me to capture thank you cinderella x my daughter and i would definitely return but i would endeavour to find out if there is a quiet season and go then my parents are in their late s early s and won t return too hectic for their liking overall a great memorable experience ,4,2018-11-18
1653,Disney still manages to impress!,i have been visiting disneyland since i was a young child i go back to the days of the e ticket just spent two very pleasant days hiding from the smoke in northern california the crowds have been lighter than anticipated the rides fun the food and snacks pricey but all good it has been years of great experiences ,5,2018-11-18
1654,Magical.,enjoyed halloween in disneyland first halloween experience for my grand daughter and she had an amasing time ,5,2018-11-18
1655,Great Time with the Grandkids!,disney has upped their game and kept the park fresh with new features particularly around the holiday season if you plan your day you can get good value from your fastpass one complaint was that the castle area was extremely congested during parades when foot path traffic is limited even for those not interested in the parade lastly disney needs to upgrade the food and dining options to something besides dry burgers and sandwiches there is one good mexican place in frontierland the security operation is appropriate but understaffed long lines await you before entering the park ,4,2018-11-17
1656,Just Ok,obviously disneyworld is the best but for the limited time i had this was a must do on my list people were fantastic and i felt like there was more shopping than rides food was good but i highly recommend the fast pass unless you like waiting on long lines lol,3,2018-11-17
1657,Halloween 2018,visited in october spent days at the park most visitors you only need days to see both parks i am just a disneyland nerd so longer the better we attended the halloween party this trip which i was a little disppointed about it seemed very busy for a limited ticket party up the prices and reduce the numbers if possible please disney the park is a classic the original disney park its the happiest place on earth the cast members do their best the staff be prepared for crowds lines and strollers and you will do ok pay and use maxpass its under used poorly used by a lot of people so time can be saved using it ,4,2018-11-17
1658,Disappointment ! Not suited for adults,the park really disappointed me all the rides are for little kids and not for adults at all we actually upgraded the tickets a person and went to the other park adventure it costs us a person the parade was great and there wasn t light pardae show the queue line is busy we waited minutes to ride,2,2018-11-17
1659,Perfect Family Vacation,somehow disneyland is even more magical at christmas i feel like we could spend a month here and still not see and do everything so we ll just happily keep coming back probably when the star wars land is finished ,5,2018-11-16
1660,"The Happiest Palce on Earth, indeed!",disneyland is an amazing place i have been times as an adult with just my sister and i with my entire family from grandparents to grandkids and all in between and finally to just my husband and i for halloween while always a busy place it s totally worth is especially for the special times of halloween and christmas ,5,2018-11-16
1661,was nice but just to busy,we visited in october we found it just to busy and didn t really enjoyed it like the other parks we went to the fast pass helps a bit but not a fan of the wait time between doing another fast pass i had been to disneyland years ago so when i ask the kids what they thought of disney that give it a just ok as they like universal and dollywood a lot better but they loved the halloween night we went to ,4,2018-11-15
1662,Wonderful time,i decided to visit disney on nov to stay away from the crowd a little bit though it is still busy it is much better than my last time in orlando just minutes waiting in line i love it s a small world journey with christmas theme and christmas parade the firework is amazing though i wish it could last longer the snow is all over the park is a good experience,5,2018-11-15
1663,Too busy and overpriced,we went to disneyland a few weekends before halloween it was our first visit to disney and to be honest probably our last it was hot overcrowded and overpriced our kids hated it and by the end of the day we were over it too the wait times to go on any ride was at least mins hours and wasn t enjoyable to say the least california adventure park was better less crowded less wait times and better rides for older kids ,3,2018-11-15
1664,mick mouse,what more can i say this is the home of micky mouse full of fun and fantasy we loved every minute is was our rd time there and never tire if it,5,2018-11-15
1665,Another great trip to Disney,we went over the long weekend in november and had another great trip yes disney is expensive but for our family they deliver for the costs and we had a great time going over the holiday when the park is decorated is in my opinion the best time of the year i love the music the special decorations and the holiday cheer we stayed on property and the extra hour in morning is great it is a bit hard to get going with the kids early but getting in early is nice you can knock out the busier rides get your fast passes i think the new max pass system is a nice upgrade from the older system it is easy to use to manage and makes for a good experience we had a birthday dinner at blue bayou for the first time we got a great water side seat that was fun and different the holiday parade is always special and my wife and i love it if i had a suggestion i really wish the food inside both parks was better fresher and healthier i do not mind a burger and fries but i think disney can do better we had lunch each day in downtown disney and found the options much better but still expensive we had some issue with rides but those happen splash mountain shut down as we were minutes from getting on but after going to guest services they gave us a anytime fast pass to make up for it and that was more than fair ,5,2018-11-14
1666,Too crowded not enough staff,we visited over the holiday in march with a big group of adults and kids the parking and bus to the resort were very good but things went down as we got into the queues for tickets the kids were well behaved and it was early morning after a long drive from vegas nearly one hour later we got to the booths to find the prices we also higher for the holidays feeling a bit ripped off we then had another long queue to get into the park itself once inside every ride was at least an hour wait the park felt too full and there were too few staff to cope with the numbers we almost left at that point deeper into the park it was quieter and after tempers cooled down the older more mature park structure began to appeal to us the trees and large original buildings were very impressive as were the lake and boat rides we finally had an enjoyable day and some of the basic rides like the train were really good i loved the hummingbirds and we got some great photos of them overall the park is a bit dated and too expensive but on the plus side the old parts are solid and impressive for a theme park they wouldn t build them that well nowadays ,3,2018-11-14
1667,"Fun, As Always, But Expensive",make sure you use fastpasses to save time waiting in line plan on doing a lot of walking and a lot of waiting if you can avoid eating in the park do so as the food is really overpriced also don t buy a mickey ears pretzel from the stand near the frozen theater the exact same pretzel that costs at many other if not all other locations in the park costs here i only discovered that after purchasing my pretzel ,4,2018-11-14
1668,"Fun, Fun and more Fun",did i say how much fun we had celebrated retirement by going to disneyland st visit and it was amazing indiana jones ride was awesome ,5,2018-11-14
1669,The place to be for Halloween,only saw a small part of the park as we were rushing to the candy stations during one of their halloween weekends it truly is a magical place so decorated so pretty so busy the lines are long for some rides sometimes you can get a picture with a princess if you stay long enough you can watch a parade and then the fantastic fireworks display over cinderella castle bring good walking shoes sunscreen water money and maybe a sweater for the cooler evenings ,5,2018-11-13
1670,A place where you will never age,thanks to my bff we have an annual pass always fun to go be a kid again but most importantly be happy at the happiest place on earth especially with the happiest bff one can ask for ,5,2018-11-13
1671,Second time to Disneyland,great for both kids and adults go early to get the most out of the trip since you ll probably be there all day ,5,2018-11-13
1672,Amazing,since i was a child i dreamed to go to disneyland it was an incredible experience and i get impressed of the service that they bring the employees are very kind and they always try to help you in everything they can altough when i visited the park there were a lot of people it did not matter because everything was very organized the only thing that i didn t like were the price and the quality of the food in some cases the food wasn t prepared adequately and the price was too expensive i think that they can improve a little bit on this i recommend this place for all the family because this kind of experiences are never forgotten ,5,2018-11-13
1673,Very busy,very very busy place took a while getting in due to the security bag checks but once through that had a great day only went on rides and waited an hour for each but rode around the park several times on the steam train good way of getting n idea of where everything is fairly expensive but i guess it is disney very clean and everyone seemed so happy ,4,2018-11-13
1674,Family time extraordinare!,disneyland is a true resort destination the sad part is that we had to visit on an extremely busy weekend the crowds were terrible the fast pass enabled us to see a lot more than we would have otherwise i would say i think they need to scrape tomorrow land and start over things are looking very dated ,4,2018-11-13
1675,Magical!,who does not love disneyland i can t believe how clean they keep it i ve been going here since the s and it has not aged you must visit in october and in december the light shows are amazing the castle is beautiful and i become a little girl again every time i visit ,5,2018-11-12
1676,"""Magical"" is Inadequate",we visited disneyland with our toddler and six year old it was an incredible experience for them especially when they got to meet around different characters and get their autographs the park is pristine and the app was a godsend be sure to enjoy a dole whip while you are there and catch the magic lots of shows for little kids to do besides waiting in line for rides which are all fantastic ,5,2018-11-12
1677,Amazing but CROWDED,it was a amazing place for those a fan of disney we went there at weekdays but still it s crowded long line like mins waiting i suggested that if you want to enjoy more rides get a fastpass even it s weekdays and more suitable for weekends it was worth it quick and to those lack of patience ,4,2018-11-12
1678,Crowded,let me preface this by saying i visited disney world last december and had an extra ticket that i was excited to use on my trip to anaheim disappointed does not even begin to describe my trip it was overcrowded people were sitting everywhere and you couldn t walk without bumping into someone the lines were ridiculous the only saving grace was that i got to take a picture with mickey this was a very expensive disappointing experience oh and some of the rides small world and others were closed for renovation ,2,2018-11-11
1679,Family SoCal trip,we traveled to california for a night vacation we purchased a day hopper pass to disney we were traveling with our son who is handicapped and our year old daughter it was very clear the first day we arrived at the park that the staff was very unsure how to help or answer questions we had we would get conflicting answers and some of the staff was rude it definitely did not have the vibe of the happiest place on earth very disappointed sad to spend that kind of money and feel like it was a waste ,2,2018-11-11
1680,Everyone loves Disneyland!,spent the day there in september with family and friends it s a kid s paradise and disney knows how to do it right not a single reason to not like this destination including the numerous hotels that are walking distance to the park ,5,2018-11-11
1681,Disney is all decorated for Christmas,beautifully decorated for the holiday season from the magic kingdom castle all lit up like an ice palace to the haunted mansions makeover disney does it right ,5,2018-11-11
1682,Halloween,park was busy halloween party was great if you can attend halloween party do it great event halloween party fireworks are great,5,2018-11-11
1683,Great Place But Changing,i have been going to disneyland for years still love the place it is a fun but horribly expensive vacation place for families it seems to me if disneyland is no longer catering to children and trying to cater to the year old age group characters were great with our grandchildren the evil queen from snow white was fantastic thanks cindy for letting us see her food is getting very expensive this place is a money making machine hope they quit raising prices on everything please don t take this as a negative review we had a great time i know change must occur but don t forget what brought you to this point it wasn t star wars it was cartoon characters that children fell in love with ,4,2018-11-11
1684,Beware the October crowds,i visited disneyland on october th and th i normally visit during the summer over the for two three days for the fourth of july i love the fireworks and it has become a family tradition i am the disney fanatic of my family and i am the person in the family that ensures that each child gets a trip to disneyland or disneyworld i have noticed over the past years or so that disney s service food and crowds have all gone through marked change and not towards the positive on this particular trip i flew my sister brother in law brother son and toddler niece for a weekend for my niece s first disney trip i had not visited in the fall in some years and was not prepared for the crowds when we arrived from our walk from our hotel the security line was almost to the main entrance on harbor boulevard we survived the hour wait to get to the security station by entertaining the two year old between the five of us when we finally got in we had to wait in another almost hour long line to get the das for my son he has a medical condition that makes it inadvisable to stand in crowded lines in close proximity with other people we had used the das on several of our other trips to disneyland and found the disneyland the best out of all of the places we had visited including disneyworld and universal studios this is a large part of why i continued visit disney even after he went through a life threatening experience he loves disney just as much as i do so i try to find ways to make sure he can still visit both parks were super packed and we quickly learned that everything was abnormal on this visit two members of our party kept falling off of the das they told me they were having glitches with the system that day the lines were ridiculously long like christmas time long e g pirates was a minute wait i rode a total of four rides between the two parks the entire day child swap was also not being utilized in ways that it had been previously we were told that one parent would have to wait outside the ride and then wait in the fast pass line by alone in order to ride which made for double the time and was no longer child swap so my sister and brother in law were able to ride a total of two rides each the lines for every restaurant quick service etc were tremendously long overall the entire trip was a lot of standing in line with little to show for it i am a disney veteran and have only experienced lines like this during christmas and new years at disneyworld when i go during those times i already have the expectation that i will not really be riding rides i go for the christmas activities and decorations this trip was unfortunately an expensive mistake this was my first disney experience where i had regrets for visiting the parks it was a disappointment all around i did talk to guest services waiting in line again about my initial issues with das not working i also wrote to disney about many of the numerous things that went wrong while i was there that i have not recounted in this review but have not received any response which is not disney like they are normally the gold standard for guest service this felt like an alternate reality disney experience for me and i sincerely hope it is not indicative of a new disney normal ,1,2018-11-10
1685,Mickeys halloween night,what a blast so fun but way too crowded fireworks and theme on castle during presentation is out of this world ,5,2018-11-10
1686,Happiest place on earth,i went to visit the park with a friend adults and we had a blast line times were leas than minutes there were a few rides closed and i was a bit disappointed in the lack of characters that were around the christmas parade was great and my first time seeing it much smaller park than disney world and easy to get around and see lots in one day ,5,2018-11-10
1687,"A Full-on Day of rides, fun and memories!",we bought a day pass for disneyland and california adventures between the we spent hours from opening to close while it was high price we made worth of it by visiting early where crowd was already building there was aa introductory max pass which was great as we could book time to go to a ride already only can be used once every hours or until its used since we used it early we got through most of the rides before noon however the app was very slow and used lot of battery so pretty much all our phones were dead by evening food was reasonably priced but delicious the hot cocoa is mind blowing and probably best we had in us make sure to be around for the show at pm which was brilliant and perfect closing just make sure to get there an hour early as spots book out and you re not allowed to stand around we came back exhausted but jubilant ,5,2018-11-10
1688,Brilliant!!,loved everything about the park from the staff and performers to the rides and shows we definitely got the magic of disney on our first visit to the park the maxpass and photopass features are definitely worth spending that little bit more for for the benefits they give you thanx to all concerned for giving us the magic of disney our only disappointments were firstly my daughter loves moana she was dressed as moana the day we were there and on the day we visited halloween moana wasn t there she was only around on weekends the other thing was that while we were going round the park we were getting coins pressed at each place we also got them done everywhere else we visited in america on our last day before going home as we were packing our cases we realised that all the coins from our first day ast disney were missing they d been left on the dresser in the hotel whereas all the other coins we d got had been put in my wife s sunglass case so the coins not put away we presume had been taken by the housekeeping staff my daughter was really upset ,5,2018-11-10
1689,"Don't believe that Disneyland will ever be a ""ghost town""",seriously so done with the magic of disneyland we took our kids to dl for the halloween party and then nov historically it s supposed to be a ghost town thurs but it wasn t fri was less busy than thurs i have given up on trying to find that perfect magical time to go our kids had a blast and we ll keep spinning it that way but the parents are so happy to check dl off the list it s really a shame that they let so many people in it really does take the magic out of it when you have to wait and wait for everything even if you do the fast pass you re still doing a lot of running around so in the end is it worth it on a positive note we did ride almost all the rides until our kids could not handle anymore over the days we loved the breakfast with minnie and friends at plaza inn i m so glad we did that on the last day because that truly made our kids trip we loved a lot of the rides they were doing maintenance on it s a small world so that was a bummer but thankfully dl knows how to do cool rides effects and character coolness i just really wish they wouldn t let so many people in there s got to be a way to balance that out it just feels like a greedy money machine the last few times i ve went ,3,2018-11-09
1690,Dreams definitely come true here,we spent three days here recently and had the best time staff were amazing park was clean food outlets rest rooms and water fountains were plentiful and easily accessible lines for the popular rides were long as was expected but the fast pass option made it a great day also being able to get all of the photos for free that are taken in the park made the max pass amazing value only downside was trying to get photos with the characters was not always easy as the times weren t always published on the app ,4,2018-11-09
1691,"A Classic, but Not Like Orlando",we re a disney family so traveling to disneyland park was not surprising however one cannot compare disneyland with walt disney world in orlando the park is small and claustrophobic it feels like too many rides in such a small amount of space it was nice because it was the original ,4,2018-11-09
1692,First annual,pleasant outing enjoyed strolling through the park very clean chose this time of year to avythe crowd good decision,5,2018-11-09
1693,THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!!!,let me first start by saying that we are huge fans of all things disney so i would say that this review might be viewed as biased even though it is a hour drive for us to go to disneyland we have still purchased annual passes in the past and we have found ourselves going and times a year the best advice i can give is to plan plan plan we always smile when we go through the gates and hear people say things like where should we go now we already know where to go and in what order to go throughout our day in fact most days we have already been on all of the rides that we love times by then we go back to our hotel and take a nap and then come back for the rest of the day until closing and we usually do that for days in a row believe me when we are done with our vacation we need a vacation from our vacation because we are worn out we arrive at the park before the gates open and they have to chase us out of the park at the end of the day but when you pay so much money to go you ve got to get the most bang for your buck do your homework it will pay off best of luck hope you enjoy your disney vacation as much as we do ,5,2018-11-08
1694,California wedding and visit with Mickey,great place of course expect to spend lots of and go during the day night lighting is not nearly adequate enough ,5,2018-11-08
1695,Magical,no other place like it many of the rides i remembered from my first visit as a kid used max pass for pirates haunted mansion star tours no wait for tea cups and train short wait for nemo submarines pinocchio and dumbo daughter and granddaughter got to do all the princess stuff they wanted back at night and went on jungle cruise mr toads ride snow white ,5,2018-11-08
1696,It's Disneyland... What else is there to say?,i ve been going to disneyland since i was a kid i was able to go see california adventure during cast previews what can i say i ve lived through the ups and the downs of the park but it s disneyland and one of those places that just brings back so many good memories ,5,2018-11-07
1697,Fall break trip,we took our son to disneyland for fall break in october we had a good time spent two days at the park and one day at california adventure park near the park entrance avoid down town disney unless you want to spend extra time walking if you have some one that needs a wheel chair rental those are available at the main entrance of the park only and you will need to walk all the way through down down disney if you park in the wrong lot something that would be nice is a shuttle service from down town disney as well as the main park entrance we had a good time the park was very busy get the fastpass for the rides it will save you a lot of time standing in line the food was great at both parks this was a surprise parking was twenty buck daily i thought this was a bit high because i saw no security or any additional service to make this charge for parking worth the price if there was a shuttle service to both the park and down town disney it might help justify this cost most of the staff are very helpfu the other problem was the lack of electronic wheel chairs seems they only have enough to serve a few hundred people when there are thousands of people in the park daily i was not the only person in need of a electric chair there was a waiting list by am and they told me no powered chairs would be available till pm other than that the week was a blast invest in a few more electrical wheel chairs and offer a shuttle from down town disney and it would have been a perfect fall break ,5,2018-11-07
1698,"""Where the dreams come true""",a wonderfull place every age people can enjoy it ride that lasts all day i went with baby and had no problems ,5,2018-11-07
1699,Really the most Awesome Place on Earth,from the moment you walk into the park you are swept away to another time and place if you never go a single ride just walking thru disneyland is a joy to behold and if you think that sounds like hyperbole you would be wrong i have been going to disneyland since it opened and i still try to get there at least times a year walking down mainstreet with the shops and cable cars and often disney characters roaming the street is just too much fun my favorite rides are pirates of the caribbean it s a small world space mountain and always the haunted mansion the mickey mouse pretzels are always yummy and we love going to new orleans square for chowder in a bread bowl the price may seem high but when you think of the hours and hours of fun food fun rides and fun people watching it s actually a great deal go my friend be a kid again take your kids and be watch their fun disneyland is the happiest place on earth,5,2018-11-07
1700,Always amazing!,disneyland is always amazing what else can you say clean bathrooms and plenty of garbage cans just add to the awesome rides and the disney magic some cast members are more helpful then others but overall a great experience,5,2018-11-07
1701,A dream 4 days,we all had an awesome time from first thing in the morning to leaving late at night fast passes and single riders made queuing a time saver plus we went midweek a dream holiday,5,2018-11-07
1702,Still a worthwhile place to spend a day,although hardly changing in some areas of the park since i ve been coming here original visit in lived nearby in s periodic visitor ever since is still an attraction for all ages however i did feel a little uninspired unexcited and unimpressed with a number of rides the seasonal halloween christmas get up afforded to the haunted house is simply awful and a complete let down and to think some folks were waiting up to minutes to see this matterhorn a favourite thrill ride was closed the subs look dated the tiki room has been a favourite but the drop down roof swinging star is no longer part of the show the jungle cruise driver the only reason for adults to be entertained with corny dad jokes was bad she failed to annunciate her dad jokes clear enough through the mic for anyone to understand what the heck she was saying no one was even snickering because we couldn t understand her space mountain ride now completely in darkness there was a time when galaxies and planets were visible overall good but shows and rides getting shorter and cheaper with time ,3,2018-11-07
1703,1 TIME IS PROBABLY ENOUGH,as a native californian i m going to go out and say this is probably one of the best amusement parks out there by no means is it a thrilling one but it really hits the nail when it comes to feels most people get an overwhelming sense of stepping into the past or reliving their childhood disneyland is definitely there to engulf and rake in on that nostalgia prices are a bit steep but magic comes at a price dearie lots of shopping and foods to try definitely go try the pineapple dole whip there s a cult following things to keep in mind expensive crowded at times and loud best bet is to go during non peak season which is the time between school breaks spring summer winter and avoid major holidays eat at non peak times after pm bring snacks an empty water bottle to fill and a good attitude it will help ,5,2018-11-07
1704,Do it once...if you can 😂,oh disneyland what more can you say about the happiest place on earth not exactly the cheapest of amusement parks but probably if not the best am i biased probably as a native southern californian this park is near and dear to me if you re looking to relive some nostalgia and willing to blow a bit of cash then this place is for you crowds vary throughout the year but your best bet is to go during the slow season jan march avoid major holidays and school breaks spring summer winter crowds can be overwhelming and the wait times can often get pretty crazy minutes etc so be prepared wear comfortable shoes pack some light snacks and bring a good attitude it ll definitely help ,5,2018-11-07
1705,The Happiest place on earth ?,not a lot of seating for when you are line for rides the characters smile a lot but in the heat and crowds not a lot of other people where smiling ,4,2018-11-06
1706,Always magical,disneyland is a great place to vacation with young kids and family we went during mickeys halloween party and it so was much fun definitely recommend,5,2018-11-06
1707,My childhood dream come true,this place is magical enjoyed the food entertainment the shops rides i would suggest the app was extremely disappointing for rides the park can definitely afford more signs ,4,2018-11-06
1708,Saved the first for last,we ve been a disney family for a long time season pass holder stayed at the resorts visited all the parks last year we made it to california adventure loved them all but the one park we have never been to was the original disneyland park so last summer we loaded up the truck and made the trip back to anaheim to see what the big fuss was all a about we loved it it was pretty much just like disneyworld except a lot smaller maybe not as many dining choices but the rides and attractions were pretty close to the same with a few differences space mountain was a bit different not quite as much fun because you are in the dark the whole time other than that we really had a great time people in california keep saying the original park is the best i won t go that far but i will say it s a much easier day than disneyworld ,5,2018-11-06
1709,Wonderful - Loved Walking Where Walt Walked!,after trips a year to wsw and finally going to dl it was a dream come true could have picked a better time as the crowds were huge due to columbus day weekend and gay days but with kids following college high school work schedules it was the only time that worked for the of us so that we could see the haunted mansion set up as nightmare before christmas it just so happened that my son decided to propose to his girlfriend in front of the castle which was amazing and even more so thanks to the photopass people fantasyland was incredible small tight to get around but the charm was breathtaking you can feel walt s presence as he planned each and every detail with his imagineers the quaintness of all the fairytales we grew up hearing were all around us our kids ages from who still travel with us old people lol noticed it as well as us adults the lack of cm was amazing there was hardly anyone around to ask a question or directions not even a bathroom attendant and the bathrooms were disgusting in comparison to wdw when you did speak to a cm they were practically dismissive i understand it was probably one of their busiest weekends however as a disney trained cm please do not act as if you are working at six flags over the course of our stay we spoke to many cm as we ususally do the only friendly ones were east coast ones either they noticed the accents or just needed to vent as they all had something to as along the lines that ca is quite different and not the friendliest place like fl or the parks overseas so keep that in mind had i had this info prior i would have been prepared for the experience and would not have wasted any negativity on it and enjoyed the first day more i plan on going back and will definitely follow a crowd calendar prior to planning however halloween is nothing like it in wdw nothing beats it in ca ,4,2018-11-06
1710,35 years!,i hadn t been to disneyland in years and although i know a lot has changed the best thing is to get the fastpass a bit of juggling but not having to wait in line as long is worth the cost ,4,2018-11-06
1711,Dineyland Memories,we enjoyed a day at disneyland it was fun to remember all the past times we visited dinseyland when our kids were younger excited for the new star wars area there seem to be a lot of updates going on in the park we went on a day that they had a halloween party night about p m we decided to leave early as all the halloween people have started coming in and it was getting over crowded we did have a great time and did not have to wait over an hour for any ride we got holiday churros which were really yummy the pumpkin spice and the spicy cinnamon disney is always a fun place for families ,5,2018-11-06
1712,Its Disneyland.... happiest place on earth!,yeah you can complain about the crowds and the price and blah blah blah but in the end its disneyland happiest place on earth ,4,2018-11-06
1713,Awesome as expected,we spent days at disneyland some full some just a few hours park was always clean staff super friendly we managed to see the transition from normal disneyland to halloween which was great if we went during the week lines only bout minute wait and not crowded at all ,5,2018-11-06
1714,Maxpass,it doesn t work i ve spent hours on the phone now trying to get the app and the maxpass to work i paid for the maxpass and it doesn t work and it s no refundable disney app doesn t work on our laptop ipad android phones don t waste your money and i hear the cost of the maxpass is going up i expect better from disney before all the electronic app stuff it was a great place now it s just plain frustrating ,1,2018-11-06
1715,Too crowded and disappointed,hi we are a family from australia with teens i have been to the park three times this will be my last tickets are so expensive which i understand as there is a huge upkeep but it s the way there is no consideration of guests if something is out of order we got talked into one park pass over two days and the ride we came for the roller coaster in the adventure park broke we had a fast ticket i went to customer relations to see if we could do something like come and ride it tmro and it was a flat no we had a fast ticket the next day to indiana jones and they also broke the guy told us we could come back later no problems we got sent a multiple ride voucher as a supposed concession so we went on another ride only to find out we couldn t go back on the indiana jones as a fast pass as the tickets are so expensive i think that was a but rough ,2,2018-11-06
1716,Staff need to get Happy!,not sure what s going on here but in the two days we were here the staff where very crabby i m not sure what s happened but almost no smiling and just a series of barking out rules and that was all over the entire park the energy of the staff has changed dramatically ,1,2018-11-06
1717,"Stroller park, scooter park now, crowded and expensive",been a few times but this one was my last too many strollers and now adding too many scooters to the walkways i hope disney owners have good lawyers to penny up when they let scooter speed and hit people in the parks or near the gates i was almost hit by two speeding scooters also you cannot walk through without someone or something hitting your heals and taking off your shoes so crowded and just disfunctional now the security asked me what my medication was like not even airport security would ever ask me that and when i said the name she looked so satisfied that she was able to be so snoopy to things that are not a risk to the public at all it also use to be cleaner not no more with all the pissed off employees that dont get paid enough i seen staff yelling at a woman for texting and walking it was disturbing to be yelling at her like that as if he was a policeman i seen rude staff this time everywhere not magical no more ,2,2018-11-06
1718,My favorite weekend getaway,every time i go to disneyland i am impressed it is always clean the cast members are always friendly the food is always fresh and it is always a fun happy experience there is no place like it you always feel like a kid when you go and you never want to leave it is a must do trip if you have never gone there are rides and treats for people of all ages ,5,2018-11-05
1719,Smaller But More Personal Disney Experience,my east coast family and i are diehard walt disney world fans i also lived in south florida for ten years and participated in the wdw college program so the orlando park feels like home to me and we were thrilled to spend time in the original disneyland park we arrived on halloween oct and scored last minute tickets to mickey s halloween party the tickets were very expensive but when would we ever get to spend halloween at disneyland together again the park was not crowded at all and due to the special ticketed event the lines were even shorter as the evening wore on space mountain was themed for halloween which was really great we enjoyed dressing as disney characters and trick or treating in the park together such a novel and awesome experience we loved going on the re themed leagues attraction which was removed from the orlando park years ago was also fun to see the mr toad and snow white attractions again i think we were all blown away by the nightmare before christmas overlay on the haunted mansion i thought there would be a few accents here or there but it was a completely over the top makeover the park is much smaller than wdw but i loved this because it felt more authentic and real i felt like i was truly a guest in the traditional sense the pace was much more laid back and the cast members seemed more relaxed too it wasn t very busy except for the last day we were there loved the fireworks display with julie andrews narrating the history of the park and i loved seeing the disneyland s unique offerings including the pinocchio and alice in wonderland attractions it was also fun to walk through the castle and learn more about the legend of sleeping beauty there is something very special about visiting the first disney park where walt disney himself spent so much time enjoying his wondrous creation i ve been looking at the black and white photos for years and reading about disney history and it s just amazing to finally go there and experience it in person ,5,2018-11-05
1720,Love it!!,we had been to disneyworld first then came to disneyland on our way home love it here but it definately feels like the older park of the two magic kingdoms which is fine it has more of a disney feel my only negative would be the crowds the wait times for some rides are so long i wish they would regulate the amount of people they let in the gates to make it fairer for everyone but it s disney and it will always be the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-11-05
1721,Underwhelming,i was prepared for the fact that the original park is substantially smaller than the magic kingdom in disneyworld however i found the park in the middle of october to be extremely crowded with entirely too many strollers single and tandem blocking up the aisles i am older but not a codger however disney needs to limit the number of guests into this park one could not find a place to even sit down also the lines for the rides were ridiculously long as were waits for food i realize that many if not most visitors are local and many have annual passes however for those of us who have come a long distance to visit the park is a turn off quite frankly if this had been my first visit to a disney theme park it would have been my last ,1,2018-11-05
1722,Best for Families,i have visited other disney parks but always with children it is most definitely not the same without children still a good day but different really enjoyed the parade ,5,2018-11-05
1723,Amazing visit,it s the last disney in the world i have left to go second biggest in the world and very memorable experience very unfortunate there weren t fireworks on the day we went otherwise it would be better ,4,2018-11-05
1724,"Overall, just okay.",we had high hopes bringing our kids for the first time we had visited before having kids and have taken the kids to disney world in large rides were closed the entire time days we were in disneyland and area it s a small world and matterhorn guests would benefit from switching out water fountains to include water bottle filling stations it is not as easy as it is claimed to fill water bottles at restaurants we were very disappointed that disney is selling tickets to prime spots to watch fantasmic the entry to the park should more than cover shows and other attractions in the park overall we had fun but kids were more than happy to leave at the end of our days it would be nice if disney refocused on the experience of guests and families versus looking for more ways to print money ,3,2018-11-05
1725,The original Disney Park at it´s best!,great family park with the classic disney quality and service at its best recommend more than the orlando park if you travel with small children ,5,2018-11-04
1726,No princesses?!!,it s a good job my little girl is more micky than elsa as in the three days we were there i did not see one princess in the park disney is a great day out for the family no denying the staff are great and can t do enough the only thing that lets it down is the cost of food and the lack of characters in the park surprisingly there was more at euro disney,4,2018-11-04
1727,1st time visit.,we have been to florida a few times and loved it thought we would try out disney over this side loved it as we thought we would although fast pass and photo pass technology are a bit behind orlando but great days out ,5,2018-11-04
1728,Terrible Experience,hugely disappointed didn t meet my expectations been to hk disneyland last and october i thought disneyland anaheim was way much better since it s more expensive much bigger and prides itself as the original but it s not the pm fireworks show was suddenly discontinued with no given reason at all we waited inconveniently standing for an hour inside a roped area for the fireworks show to start with all those excited people who travelled from all over the world only to be cut abruptly big letdown my senior parents looked forward to the stage shows sadly we were so bored the railroad train was so boring and a huge waste of time nothing substantial to see queues for the attractions were so long that you ll lose all the patience still left in you the pixar play parade hmm just ok i wanted my parents to experience mickey mouse donald duck cinderella snow white lion king aladdin and the gang my parents don t know those pixar characters suggestion why not make sets of parades instead to cater to all your customers since you mentioned you re a family oriented recommended for all ages happiest place on earth fantasmic was really nice but having no available tickets left we were pushed to an overcrowded area standing uncomfortably for an hour with very limited vision to the show it was shown just twice to think that there were hundreds of thousands of paying customers and i m sure at least of them wanted to see fantasmic disneyland management that s not rocket science right mark twain steamboat river cruise tour was a big joke it s a small world was closed for refurbishment pixar short film d was the only bright spot that happened to us last my mom wanted to have a picture taken with mickey mouse but they do not want to that s why my mom was trying her luck to chase that fvcking unaccommodating mickey mouse mascot and his uncompassionate handler totally not worth it hard to recommend to my friends family relatives co workers so unmagical ,1,2018-11-04
1729,Medina family,we really enjoyed meeting all the caricatures i was very disappointed that it s a small world was not open that was the main reason i wanted to go a lot to do but not enough rides for toddlers ,5,2018-11-04
1730,It's Disneyland,i could probably come here days straight and not experience the whole park so much to do it s overwhelming love it ,5,2018-11-03
1731,Perfect for honeymoons,disneyland in california was so memorable we went on november st so we evidently missed the giant pumpkin and halloween celebrations however the mix of halloween and mostly christmas decor was a nice added touch with the maxpass we barely waited in line for more than minutes and you can reserve your spot at a ride on the app as opposed to physically walking to the ride and getting a fast pass this was worth it and highly recommend for extra the park has all the classic rides you can find at disneyworld in orlando the only one i would ve loved to see was the carrousel of time a personal favorite the attention to detail in every square inch of the park is remarkable we got the park hopper for adventure park as well and i highly recommend it pixar pier is so much fun and really beautifully built and you can travel from adventure park to the disneyland park easily as they are next to each other a fun time for all ages go early when the park opens to get into all the popular rides right away and beat the long lines loved it so much and will return soon ,5,2018-11-03
1732,Best trip ever.,disneyland was phenomenal we had been a couple months ago for the first time but second time around we did absolutely everything it was so much fun so much to do for everyone you can not get bored in disneyland bring lots of money though to many temptations everywhere lol,5,2018-11-03
1733,It’s Disney!!!,it s disney of course it s going to be great even the bad experience we had with rides breaking down was more than put right by guest relations a magical time at the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-11-02
1734,Family Vacation,just like the other calif adventure park but we had fun felt food and drinks over priced not sure if i went to the wrong time of the year crowed and lines were extremely long for the rides however we did had a great time and were pleased i will not go again only because of the huge crowds but that is me ,3,2018-11-02
1735,Ughhhhh Never Ever Again,i was so looking forward to visiting disneyland i was very let down long queues overpriced food and drink broken down rides where to start i think when one has to queue one and a half hours not kidding in mickey s house for a photo questions have to be asked why is there not more than one mickey mouse for a photo why not have or rooms with mickeys in for photos why is it when you queue outside for a photo with a character all of a sudden told are told sorry no more photos pluto has to go and have a nap but he ll be back in minutes they should have a cut off point long before instead of making you wait only to be told no photo don t get me started on the price of food and water in this joint again a total rip off then we get told sorry no fireworks tonight the crowd is too small blimey i d hate to see a large crowd unacceptable if the say fireworks they should have fireworks then we get in the haunted house and the thing breaks down minutes in we have to wait minutes to be let out no apology nothing this place is a complete and utter shambles run down tired and in desperate need of a new ceo who has passion and foresight to get the place running efficiently again unfortunatey because this is the original disneyland the crowds will keep coming so this place will never improve i will never ever attend another disneyland anywhere in the world my childhood dreams have been shattered forever ,1,2018-11-01
1736,couple get away vacation,disneyland was great especially the haunted mansion it was done as nightmare before christmas and was fantastic the park was all decorated for halloween crowded but very manageable to get around fast pass now bring you back to the most popular rides several hours later but there s always something to do there,5,2018-11-01
1737,Pricey but fun.,so it s disneyland it s not gonna be a cheap day out but you get your moneys worth theme parks hundreds of characters dressed up great attractions a boat ride a great shopping street the only way to do the parks is the day pass and with the fast pass otherwise i don t think it would be at all enjoyable the queues are relentless we went on a thursday and a friday thursday was great as there was only about people across the parks friday was mental i think there was double the amount of people it was silly we queued for minutes to get through security then another minutes to get into the park but as we were hard core and got there at both days and didn t leave except an hour a day for lunch until closing time it was pretty cool you can get on all the rides you just need to plan ,4,2018-11-01
1738,Mickeys Halloween Party Review,our last trip to disneyland we purchased the mickeys halloween party tickets i was a little concerned that my kids might be to old for this event youngest is however we were all very impressed and loved this event highly recommended during the halloween party the park is closed to the public unless you have a event ticket which means the park was about full there was zero wait at any rides and attractions also disney brings out way more characters for the event and they interact alot more with the guests adults and kids are able to go trick or treating throughout the park and my kids left with a full bag of treats each dressing up is encouraged and some of the costumes we saw were unbelievable the fireworks towards the end of the night were amazing and far surpassed the normal disney fireworks show this year was the first year they had the headless horseman at disneyland we were glad we got to see that two other bonuses were your allowed in the park hours before the event starts and all your photopass photos from that day are included in the ticket price i would recommend this event for families with kids of all ages ,5,2018-11-01
1739,Worst trip ever, for days and the halloween party very rude cast members horrible cold food and very over priced prices keep going up for a cheesebuger for a pop with no refills anytime you look around there is never any management to help you never again at this place cheeseburger and waited for over an hour for a show that was canceled and never bothered to make an announcement to let anyone know thanks for nothing disneyland,1,2018-11-01
1740,Sadly disappointed,it s years since i last visited and i wouldn t be bothered if it was another before i return very expensive for one day park hopper tickets with maxipass the wifi coverage was very poor and this made using the app difficult you needed it for the maxipass the staff crew members looked very shoddy and untidy and some areas of the park looked tired and in need of updating it was also very crowded the restaurant we chose to eat in refused my year old daughters driving licence as id for her to have an alcoholic drink sayng their policy was only to accept passports for foreigners overall disney is now a money making machine and has certainly lost the family centered fun provider of years past ,3,2018-10-31
1741,Disabled at Disneyland,it was frustrating to find the handicap entrance to the rides usually at the exits had to receive a come back time which made for a lot of wasted time waiting as there usually was not enough time to do something else they need to emulate disney world where the process is much more efficient ,4,2018-10-31
1742,A great time!,smaller than wdw obviously but still a great time didn t feel small when we in park as we ll come back to do stuff we didn t get a chance to do next time here ,4,2018-10-31
1743,"I mean, it's DISNEYLAND!",the prices keep going up so try to go on value days if you can park hoppers are unnecessary for the additional just arrive at am and stay until midnight if you can and experience dca on the next day who is really going to go back and forth between parks all day fastpasses are a must make sure you target space mountain the matterhorn haunted mansion and splash mountain first star tours always has a massively long wait time too you can get the other rides in pretty quickly for the little guys peter pan and mr toad s wild ride always has a long wait time as well to relax for a moment take the train not the monorail that goes around the entire park this will give your feet about a good min break while seeing all of the park ,5,2018-10-30
1744,MICKEYS HALLOWEEN PARTY BEWARE - GOT BURNED BAD,we were sold regular admission tickets for our family and explained that we had to buy the halloween party tickets in addition to regular admission to get into the halloween party we found out when we arrived that was not the case the operator failed to explain that we only needed to buy the halloween party tickets and enter at pm and did not in fact need to spend over for regular day passes as well we tried to get a resolution and get them to have us listen to the audio recording of our call and walt disney travel company was rude and unresponsive and continued to tell us it was our fault even though i specifically asked if the tickets needed to be bought in addition to the regular admission tickets very disappointed in the customer service and will never go back after spending a lot of money there for the last ten years very disappointing customer service but they are too big to care goodbye disney you suck let me give the rest of you advice for the amount of money my family has spent there in ten years we could have traveled the world over and over again disney customer support has declined most of these reviews are likely written by fakers from india they do not care about defrauding a customer we accepted that it might have been an accident but they did nothing to mitigate and help us solve the problem when they have recorded phone lines and could hear me ask if i had to buy the tickets in addition to regular admission never again ,1,2018-10-30
1745,Magical,wow wow wow there is so much to this park my fianc and i had an amazing time with family and friends wish we could have spent a few days here as theres no way to do everything in the park in one day the disneyland app is extremely helpful download it before your visit you can make reservations view the map and schedule your next ride which saves you loads of time get the fast pass you won t regret it we debated on it and decided to get it and we were so happy we did the rides are all soooooo incredible and detailed i wish i could give this place stars they deserve it it truly is the happiest most magical place on earth ,5,2018-10-30
1746,Halloween poor relations!,i booked our tickets months in advance of our trip only to find on arrival that we would be chucked out of the park hours early to allow the halloween party guests into the park we only had the day there and wouldn t have paid the entrance fee if we had known about the early closing on emailing disney i was told that they were sorry that i hadn t read the notice about the early closing treating me like some kind of idiot even though they admitted that it was only posted weeks in advance there was no apology that i hadn t been notified after booking there was no note when i booked happiest place on earth or money making machine you decide ,3,2018-10-30
1747,First time Disneyland visitors,well it s the original happiest place on earth we had day passes but only used days of them our experience wasn t very magical or happy the line ups for the rides are ridiculous and often you are standing in the scorching heat for well over an hour waiting your turn the place is very crowded the onsite food options are ludicrously priced too and the food is tasteless poorly cooked we threw our food out more than once partially eaten we bought the additional fast pass tickets on our second day in the effort it made getting into rides quicker the fast pass is another joke firstly it s an extra cost per person per ticket then it can only be used once every hrs and it the park designates the times you can use it each ride upon arriving at am we were informed by a friendly disney staff member that the fast pass ticket for the ride we chose was not usable until pm that evening ridiculous we did our rd day in the evening for the chance to look at the place lit up and night and the fireworks adequate but were only able to get onto rides in the while park due to overcrowding not at all the happiest place for our family not a very magical experience we opted out of our last days available on our day pass ,4,2018-10-29
1748,Family bucket-list item = tick,we hadn t taken our family to disneyland and our kids weren t as thrilled as i expected them to be at the news we were going that all changed a few hours in to our first day by that evening they were wearing their ears proudly and in the fast pass line for their rd ride on big thunder the atmosphere and the rides are top notch it s tough not to love disneyland as long as you let yourself appreciate the details most people were polite and friendly even though it was very busy the weekend days were substantially busier than the weekday we visited we took along a bag of our own snacks and water but still indulged in classic snacks like dole whips funnel cakes and giant turkey legs ,5,2018-10-29
1749,Got Engaged. Was Magical,my first disney experience at years old and let me tell you it was beyond amazing we got through lines very easily and did almost everything in the park in one day granted it was only us adults and no kids to wrangle but the max pass was a fantastic deal well worth it i can t wait to go back ,5,2018-10-29
1750,So. Much. FUN!,last minute solo trip just because i wanted to attend mickey s halloween party since i d never been and i d heard so much about it from friends that had from the minute i got into the park i was immersed in a halloween wonderland pumpkins ghosts and characters in costumes were everywhere being hispanic i was especially impressed by the coco dia de los muertos displays and there were even some snacks themed to the holiday mickey fang bread for me the best part was haunted mansion holiday where they ve done a nightmare before christmas overlay the entire time cast members were so friendly and helpful asking how my visit was recommending things that i might be interested in i can t think of one time where i had a negative experience while there for example i d never attended fantasmic and had spent the morning at california adventure so i missed out on the fast passes for the show when i went up to a few cms that were nearby and asked where the standby line for fantasmic was one offered to walk me over as we walked she asked how my day had been and if i was enjoying my visit i told her about how much fun i d had and how blown away i was by the outfits and decorations we stopped at a spot and she told me wait here for them to let you in don t leave there should be enough room i thanked her for her help and when i was let into the area i couldn t believe how close i was to what i was told was the center of the show the view was amazing and i later found out from listening to others conversations that she took me to the vip section my friends told me that was pixie dust at work i just think it was great cast member service and one of the reasons disneyland is the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-10-28
1751,Mickey’s Trick or Treating Party,disney does it right not going to lie the main reason i go to disneyland is for my kids i don t love long lines and the expense these trick or treating parties are cool because they limit the number of people who can be in the park after a certain time not only do they give lots of candy but families dress up and the lines are super short later in the evening giving you plenty of time to hit up all your favorite attractions the only negative for me was for drinks pieces of pizza breadsticks and salad for one slice of pizza seems excessive to me ,5,2018-10-28
1752,Always a fun place to travel,see and experience things that can t be see or enjoyed in orlando many unique rides an sights if you ve only been to disney world you re missing this important and original disney park,5,2018-10-28
1753,Wonderful experience,this is my th time to disneyland and it was as fun as ever better since it was mid week and off season so the crowds were less and the temperature was lovely totally worth the expense ,5,2018-10-28
1754,Sadly disapppointed with their service,honestly it s been years since i came here with my family and it has been quite a disappointment since last time i ve had at least three terrible altercations with their staff specifically their security and parking staff their security staff in the front colin was terribly disrespectful especially to my elderly who had heart surgery and couldn t go through metal detector but still forced it until another employee suggested a visual instead and then repeatedly tell us to leave as we wish if we didn t wish to comply to his unreasonable requests of making an elderly who has medical conditions to pass through metal detector then staffs who get really irritated and lash out on guests i understand that there is a lot of people but it s your job to make the place friendly and amiable instead i felt like i was a student in high school getting reprimanded for standing on the side too long or not knowing where to go last but not least the parking staff who dismissed our party of six for other younger adults who can stand in the bus i understand we have an elderly but she is from hong kong a country where buses are her primary transportation and she s quite inept with standing i overall feel like disneyland has definitely gotten worse hopefully it gets better but so far not going to go back anytime soon ,1,2018-10-28
1755,Awesome,we went there with our year old son even me and my wife enjoyed it we used the train to help us get some rest and go to different location faster ,5,2018-10-28
1756,Magical!,disney is always magical characters are fantastic and so are the disney staff september is quieter but only because people come in later for mickeys halloween event ,5,2018-10-27
1757,Service is not what it used to be...,i realize that most people won t care about this review as the magical mystery created from youth will still lead you to go here and by no means do we want you not to go but a good dose of reality needs to be taken prior and during your visit while many disney staff eagerly want your visit to be joyful and memorable the greed of management has put many responsible for line management woefully unprepared fast passes cost money especially when you purchase the on line app version to make it easier to get around the park and to manage when and where you want to go we arrived at the park at am with a six year old and we knew that you really only get one good hour per year your kid is giving us hours at the park before she melts this was our last day of a very expensive investment in disney we are vacation members as well and we were only able to get a fast pass for the haunted mansion for pm it was going to be a long day but she really wanted to go we stayed at the park all day and when we finally got to the mansion we told the staff person we were here for our fast pass and he pointed to a very long line we said no we have a fast pass for this attraction and he said yes that is the line there must have been people in line and when i asked in disbelief how that could be for the fast pass he said well its faster than the other line as the main line was hours at that point that is poor management and poor customer service there wan t any way we were going to wait another minutes with a six year old let alone consider waiting in the main line clearly disney handed out too many fast passes to make money and in our case took it without us ever having a chance to redeem the pass we left we spoke to several other disney staff and they were as indignant as the others fair warning if you think that the fast pass system will truly make your park experience a skip the line experience think again the staff acted tired and overworked and under disney ed this was a very expensive average experience and we will chose other parks in the future ,2,2018-10-26
1758,Bait and Switch - MaxScam Mickey has turned into a greasy rat,waiting in line for min to see mickey was given photo pass and told photos are free to download card says photos are unlimited to download for max pass charge exited park at pm and went home tried to get photos in morning found out the window to buy maxpass closed at midnight previous day so maxpass unlimited photos for is no longer option photos are offered to download free but there is a watermark over image and they are low resolution price for photos is now set at each called in and they offered me all photos for dollars this is a classic bait and switch very dirty dealing disney you are tricking mickey out from what was a honest mouse into a greasy profiteering rat exactly as if i went to my favourite restaurant at pm on my birthday restaurant policy is patrons eat free after pm on their birthday i order a drink appetizer my free meal and desert the bill comes after midnight and it s for the full amount because i actually ate the meal after midnight and free birthday meals are only on your birthday it says this on the fine print on the back of the menu didn t you read the fine print the restaurant knows this and expects this to happen but advertises the free meal as bait and switches when they offer the bill ,1,2018-10-26
1759,"Very well done, very crowded!",such a cool place classic disney experience almost impossible to find bathrooms not easy to find a place to eat corn dogs strollers everywhere shuttles work nicely very well organized easy parking would i go back probably not something a family should experience once ,4,2018-10-26
1760,A place for young at heart,every age should enjoy a must is patience and time go knowing u will have waiting times and u will come away with wonderful memories impossible to see all in a day we bought a day pass which also included california adventure join the single rider line and your waiting time will be cut from minutes to minutes we did this whenever possible it s a long tiring day so suggest if staying nearby go home for a few hours in the afternoon then return early evening in time to see the nightly parade and slightly cooler it is truly a place everyone should visit at least once in a life time ,5,2018-10-26
1761,It's Disneyland,yes its old yes it s crowded yes it s expensive but at the end of the day it s disneyland the smiles the park everything about it creates life long memories absolutely love it,4,2018-10-25
1762,great solo visit after conference,went for the first time as a solo visitor after a conference in anaheim was a little unsure whether to go on my own but would recommend to anyone considering it disneyland is great fun for any age i enjoyed it just as much as disneyworld as a kid something for all ages some of the rides have a single rider queue ,5,2018-10-25
1763,The Magic Continues,recently genevieve and i got a chance to cover many of the new things at disneyland and disney s california adventure that have come in since our last visit to the park we have made many trips to downtown disney and to the various restaurants and hotels around the park but had not had the opportunity to visit the park since december of our first stop was california adventure and we were in awe of the gorgeous halloween decorations which adorned the park and also the halloween costumes that the characters were as they greeted with fans throughout the park we made our way to soarin as it is one of our favorite attractions and we have not had the chance to experience since it was updated to reflect a theme of gliding over the world versus only california the new experience is simply amazing as we soared over locales ranging from paris to the great wall of china india and africa to name but a few one of our favorite moments was soaring over an african savannah and actually being able to smell the grass and aroma of the locale area once back on the ground we made our way too many favorites such as grizzly rapids and the little mermaid before we made our way to pixar pier after a stop for coffee and a fantastic tour of the bakery and some sourdough bread samples we made our way to the pier and took in all the amazing new pixar themed locales the incredicoaster was a great update to the roller coaster and the numerous pixar themed dining options were a real treat of course we had to take in midway madness and were delighted to see that it is now available via fast pass disney now offers a max pass which for a nominal fee allows guests to book fast passes in both parks online this is a huge time saver and you no longer have to walk over to an attraction to get a pass you can simply get it online and spend your time on attractions in your area while we explored the park we noticed the stark industry fencing around a bugs land which showed the changes coming as a new marvel themed area is set to open in we also made sure to enjoy cars land which was decked out in halloween splendor including the amazing characters from the series such as tom mater in his vampire outfit a thrilling race on radiator springs racer was just the thing to cap off our morning we made our way to disneyland next and took in more of the amazing halloween decorations along main street usa as we made our way to adventureland attractions ranging from the jungle cruise pirates of the caribbean the haunted mansion and splash mountain followed and we especially liked the nightmare before christmas theme the haunted mansion has during this time of year for those looking ahead to and the opening of star wars galaxies edge we could see the amazing progress that has been going on and a scenic view from big thunder mountain showed just how large and detailed this amazing expansion will be there are many things happening at the park in terms of updates as we saw fencing around the matterhorn as updates are underway and it shows the continued commitment to walt s vision that the park would never been completed as long as there is imagination left in the world it would be difficult to chronicle all the things we did on our visit but suffice it to say that we made sure to visit as many of the attractions as we could and also enjoyed the amazing fireworks and entertainment the park offers you will want to make sure to check online for the schedule for mickey s halloween party as some nights will see the park close early for the event disneyland continues to entertain and amazes as no matter how many times we visit it is always a magical experience that brings back memories of being a child as well visiting the park for the first time with my wife our granddaughter recently turned two years old and we are already looking at the amazing story of her first visit to the park as we cannot wait to see the magic and joy of experiencing the park through her eyes the parks will make their magical holiday transformation in november so if your plans take you to anaheim make sure you visit and experience a truly memorable experience ,5,2018-10-25
1764,Happiest Place on Earth,definitely my happiest place on earth i grew up going to disneyland and enjoy it to this day i love the rides and the food most people would think to come for the rides but they have so much food that is a must try ,5,2018-10-25
1765,Fabulous ...... But So Crowded,disney does what it does very well this park is no exception it s magical but our visit was marred by such huge crowds many rides had a minute wait be sure to get the fastpass pppd as this does allow you to express on a handful of selected rides via the disney app if you want to avoid a bun fight terrible junk food it s best to pre book lunch too there are a few table service restaurants if you like a glass of wine or beer with your meal you ve lucked out though this park is currently an alcohol free zone thanks walt ,4,2018-10-25
1766,Wonderful family experience but don't go on a busy day,what more can be said about disneyland yes it is a magical place that creates memories for a lifetime for the entire family at the same time yes it is an incredibly expensive day i think all of the reviews on here say enough about the park itself so i will share my tips as a local and season pass holder opposite of what others will tell you do not waste your money on a disney hotel you pay insane rates for a basic room the extra hour in the park isn t worth the price if you are a family you can get much larger rooms many with separate bedrooms for the kids at the embassy suites hyatt regency etc don t plow through the day all at once take breaks spend a few hours at the park go back to the hotel pool nap and then go back do not plan a trip during any holiday or holiday weekend you and your family will not be able to enjoy the park and you will regret it frankly do not go on a weekend at all come during the week and view the many crowd calendars before planning your trip coming on a weekend is miserable and a waste of time and money if you have small kids hit fantasyland first and do the classic rides before the lines get long bring water and snacks in your backpack to save ,4,2018-10-25
1767,Very friendly and efficient staff,upon arrival at my hotel in sheraton park hotel at the anaheim resort there is a disneyland desk in the lobby where ms lisa t from palm springs disney desk briefed me with so much enthusiasm and pride to visit disneyland she thoroughly explained in detail all the necessary information it was a great experience to visit disneyland and do recommend visitors in los angeles to visit this amazing theme park ms lisa is doing a great job in advertising the disneyland brand regards panayiotis qatar,5,2018-10-25
1768,Definetely overpriced. MaxPass(FastPass) is a trick !!!,i went to disneyland for the first time on oct th and st i bought a maxpass thinking that will help a lot but at the end i realize that i wasted my money there were very little fastpasses available for the rides many times the fast passes were not available and a few times the attractions were closed for a few hours and when reopen you had to stay in line for hours even if you had previosely a fastpass for that ride and you did not have the chance to use it as a conclusion for the money you spent around usd we stayed hours standing in huge lines it is one of the places where you see the greed of the administrators they offer big deception for big bucks making you believe that if you pay extra you can reduce a lot your waiting time but you gain maybe one hour out of hours in line ,2,2018-10-25
1769,LOVE the new App,the new disneyland fast past phone app is amazing it made our most recent experience just awesome it saved time walking you could be much more organized in picking the item you would fast pass food can be pre ordered for pick up we really enjoyed our latest experience due to this new app ,5,2018-10-25
1770,Too Crowded!,of course i love disneyland i have been going since i was ten we took our honeymoon here years ago our kids grew up here and now we go with our year old granddaughters but disney people please either super enlarge this park or cut off attendance faster we actually left saturday afternoon because we could not get through adventureland at all it was literally blocked by crowds from the main street entrance we snuck around through frontierland to use our fast pass at the haunted mansion but then were done in by the crowds when we got out it was seriously scary it was so crowded and it was out wow but the weekdays were better even the mickey s halloween party was better i did not like mickey s halloween party for my toddler granddaughters it turned out to be quite the adult party it doesn t start until so close to their bedtime most people in costumes and trick or treating were adults of course there were children too just too many adult only groups as the night wore on i felt a little uneasy having my granddaughters there i think it is time for disney to split out an earlier party for children and turn it over to adults after or ,3,2018-10-24
1771,The best place to be,disneyland is a magical place where you become a kid and enjoy every single show game ride entertainment highly recommend for all ages ,5,2018-10-23
1772,Dream Vacations,this is thruly the happiest place in earth it was our first visit and we love it we had one of the best vacation ever the face of my girls when the saw all of the disney characters was priceless love love love every little thing about this place was magical,5,2018-10-23
1773,AMAZING!!!!!!!!,how can you not love the place that it all started disneyland is one of those places to go and let reality fade away while your in the park ,5,2018-10-23
1774,October visit,i love disneyland but be wary that the park has gotten to be so crowded and expensive tips go early bec the line starts forming even before the gates open if you have zero items to pack go with that buy everything inside the park you get to skip with the mass of people with bags and strollers going through bag check you walk through the hand body scan and you re moving in spend at least two days in disneyland if it s peak season especially now they ve changed the fast pass system one can only fast pass a ride for every two hours or buy the max pass keep walking forward save all the shopping later or go outside to disneywalk that s our tip ,3,2018-10-22
1775,Disney MaxPass - Buyer Beware,i used the app to buy my tickets and get into the park i saw the app had a way to get your fast pass without running all over the park and it was not too expensive so i bought it since they were already out of fast passes they don t mention that when you are purchasing it was completely and totally useless to me they get away with it by fine print and bundling it with getting access to photos by park staff which is their excuse when you ve just been charged for a service you can t use oh you could have also gotten some photos that place was wall to wall bodies no way was this worth the money contacted support and was told to read the fine print not happy with disney ,1,2018-10-22
1776,First timer,my daughters first time at disneyland this year old will never forget her appointment at the bibbity bobbity boutique so much to see so many memories so much walking ,5,2018-10-22
1777,Truly the happiest place on earth,my family loves anything disney so of course disneyland is awesome for us we go once a year to once every other year and stay for days with the park hopper pass it is amazing ,5,2018-10-22
1778,Busiest Place in all the Land...,the theme park has lots to offer you and your family problem is you will never get to enjoy it as it is way too busy if you visiting for a day i suggest you plan ahead choose a few attractions that you want to see and rides you really want to go on prioritize these and try to get to them all make sure you get to the park early to maximise your time otherwise you will just be disappointed ,3,2018-10-22
1779,Great Halloween Event!,their special halloween event is reasonably priced fun and family friendly this is one of the best times to go ,5,2018-10-22
1780,way toooooo crowded to enjoy.,complete waste of my i want my money back and i wish i could get my day back too if an option to give zero stars would have went sat to start it took hr from parking lot to front entrance once inside its so crowded that i could t even walk its more of a shuffle and dodging around people its just a sea of people i dont know how that could even be safe to have that many people in the park there should be a limit of max attendees lines and fast pass was worthless it was out half the time and the other times all the good rides were booked up couldn t stand it and left after hrs only rode rides one of which was only good the other were more like tour rides will never go back ,1,2018-10-21
1781,"Disneyland, It is really is the Happiest Place to be",this was our first visit to disneyland have been to wdw about times but really enjoyed disneyland hope to return days was not enough saw a lot of attractions and loved each one ,5,2018-10-21
1782,Really it is the place where dreams come true!,awesome enchanting the place where everythig has born and you can feel to be in the disney dream cradle as all the others the park is divided in different zones and we liked a lot the micky mouse village visited for the first time that is particular for this park a single day is necessary to visit the park ride on attractions watch at shows and parade during the high flow period fast pass may be a good solutione to save precious time bigger than parks in paris or orlando and with a better merchandise wifi worked well enough the disney park app less however the staff was kind and polite as ever ,5,2018-10-21
1783,LA,we were here for a company sponsored event it was incredible we had four hours where the park was open to the public and then five hours with just our company the park like any other disney park was exceptional very very clean enjoyed our time at disneyland,5,2018-10-21
1784,My horrible of all Disney visits,my family had been to many disneyland and disneyworld visits over the past couple of decades my kids are now all teenagers really made the mistake of not checking the crowd tracker websites before booking spent close to for a family of for a one day park hopper with the online fastpass option apparently oct was so crowded that their fastpass app crashed by am i was not planning to drag my family around the park getting paper fastpasses even the guest services near the entrance had a hour line of guests complaining about the fastpass app trying to get refunds it s been weeks and my email request for fastpass option refund has been non existent our family ended up going on rides total can you imagine a hour wait just for haunted mansion i personally saw people just scan their pass and scoot around the fastpass crowd i personally heard from some of the guests in the fastpass lineup that that some where just scanning their hand and getting into the fastpass lineup with no valid fastpass there is no visual scanning indicator or second scanning station like disneyworld just ridiculous unfortunately will be our last time for disneyland california ,1,2018-10-21
1785,Wonderful Experience But Read Up On Halloween Scheduling!,we had our first real family vacation in disneyland and it was amazing things to expect long entrance lines some people find this frustrating but the lines do move fairly quickly and they are checking everyone for your own safety we recommend hats sunscreen and water bottles during your time both in line and in the park they don t allow selfie sticks we lost cnd because we had to surrender ours they did allow go pro sticks though which didn t seem fair considering they are virtually the same thing long ride lines get the max pass on your phone for fast passes it makes all the difference for those rides in high demand you can be in line for over an hour during peak times also find out which are the rides you want to hit that are most in demand and secure a fast pass for your magic morning if you get one with your park pass or hotel stay saves you time for sure crowds it sort of goes without saying but disney sees over visitors per day considering the amount of people you can move freely through the park and it s incredibly clean it s the lines when you notice it the most or during special events catching characters for pictures throughout the park is quite hit and miss even knowing where they tend to appear isn t going to guarantee you find them or that you are in line during their minute window if you are trying to catch rides you don t have a lot of time to chase down alice or mickey for pics unless you are around the park for over a week and can take your time you will find some of course but getting all your favourites takes time and a bit of stalking lol get tickets for shows like fantasmic first thing in the morning they sell out fast come evening get in place to watch about minutes early otherwise you will be standing throughout after a long day of walking the park if you have food allergies speak to the park before your trip it will save you a ton of time if you know where you can eat and where it is in advance you can then plan your travel through the park allowing yourself to be near to your favourite food venue during lunch etc you can find food on the run but it does take time and searching which you don t want to waste when your time in the park is limited if you have never been to a disney park it is unlike any other theme park experience it truly is magical i wasn t sold before we went but it really is amazing crowds and lines aside things to note before you book check for special event hours as we are not locals and have never been to disney our vacation time was cut drastically short due to the fact no one told us about the reduced park hours we assumed the halloween or christmas stuff was part of the general park experience and had no idea we would lose half our days to people coming in for a party that we could not attend it really took away from our experience and caused us to miss out on things after awaiting this special trip for years it was the biggest disappointment we experienced i cannot emphasize enough how much this impacted our holiday consider the weather during your travel time we are canadian and not accustomed to extreme heat so going in october was perfect we had beautiful sunny skies but we were also able to enjoy the park without running for air conditioning every ten minutes the locals told us that the summer months are far more extreme so if you are unacustomed to heat plan to go during their fall season to have the best weather experience the experience is expensive if you intend to purchase a lot of souveniers take part in pin trading look it up it s so much fun or eat in park be prepared to spend the pins for pin trading range from for singles to upwards of usd for packs soda pop or water is about usd each at the vendors so that gives you an idea of what the food prices are like the food is great in some areas not so fantastic in others but it is all costly read reviews and blogs to learn about rides food tickets helpful tips and more the more you know planning your trip and entering the park the better your experience will be there is so much to see and do that you want to ensure you don t miss something because you simply didn t know about it they have stroller parking at most rides and you can get a parent swap pass if one parent needs to stay with the littles while the older children go on with the other parent it allows the waiting parent to fast track the line up if they wish to try the ride when they return everyone can experience the magic of disney don t be discouraged if you get motion sick unfortunately i can t stomach anything but the ride through story rides but i had an amazing time anyway the sights are wonderful and the people are great we had such a good time i just wish we had gotten our full days so we could have our full experience our disappointment at the reduced hours and letting the special event ticket holders flood into the park a half hour before the event was the only thing holding us back from a full five star rating we will return again one day as disneyland has a special place in our hearts ,4,2018-10-21
1786,Happy place,this was honestly such a great surprise we went with our two teenager and we all loved it it was so hot this day that we deiced to not get there until pm so unfortunately we missed an out on some parts of the park but the heat would have got to us there were some great rides and the atmosphere was wonderful for one day it really was the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-10-21
1787,Great but soooo crowded,we loved our visit before all the crowds arrived during fall break like spring break when kids are out of school for a couple days it s so crowded you can t even walk down the street together as a family that s not fun but before it got too crowded we were able to ride a bunch of rides repeatedly and that was really fun it s hard to find a time where it is not super crowded anymore though unfortunately the prices are outrageous as well you really have to budget save and plan ahead we tried to save money by bringing in our own lunches and snacks throughout the day but still ended up spending around daily for snacks and or one meal ,4,2018-10-21
1788,"Oh, the humanity .…",i paid how much to stand in a line for hours it took me an hour just to get to the bag inspection it is wall to wall people quite literally i recall decades ago we could check off all the rides in a day and have a blast doing it now we will be lucky to ride or after standing for minutes in the hot sun for each ride i would much rather they tell me tickets are sold out than keep packing people in and making things miserable plus i get the privilege of overpaying for food and drink for a coke for a small bag of chips i will not return to this park ,2,2018-10-20
1789,very dissapointing and expensive,we normally go to disneyworld in florida it is an amazing place and we always have an amazing time i expected the same amazing experience at disneyland in annaheim instead it was overcrowded and basically we got on only rides for the both parks that is an expensive price to pay for such little entertainment and we paid extra so we could supposidly enjoy more rides i will never go back and will never reccommend that anyone else go to disneyland in addition the cost of food and beverages was way too high especially for the beverages considering the warm temperatures it was in the high s in adition at disney world you always see the disney characters walking around the kids love interactiing and getting autographs and photos we saw one carachter and it was captain hook this was on oct this just isn t acceptable ,1,2018-10-20
1790,Fun but not great,we had fun with some of the rides that were more for adults some of the rides lack a bit of information to understand there characteristics as not everybody reacts equality to drops high speed etc some of the queuing was considerable not that many live size characters around that you can interact with in genera in terms of rides and the experiences of interacting with the live size characters universals studios is much much better option ,4,2018-10-20
1791,Amazing first visit for our 4 and 6yrold boys!,we did disneyland over night which was a halloween special event where they close the park off to people who do not hold tickets and we did a day hopper pass for the next days so we made sure we did our fast passes for the rides that had large waiting lines and that was a brilliant idea so make sure you have a phone and can use wifi it makes a huge difference with the little ones if you want to watch a parade people usually start getting their spots mins or earlier make sure you have some food and something to keep your kids entertained while waiting or just try and squeeze into a spot before it starts can get very tricky if your gona purchase items dont buy them straight away otherwise you will have to carry them around all day we were luckily enough to stay at the resort so that forked perfectly so we didnt have to caryy much stuff just a small backpack which we took on nearly all rides we did nearly all rides in the park kids just missed the incredibles coaster and indiana jones the guest services at the park are brillant if you have children with special needs you can get a virtual wait in line pass from them incase your child cannot cope with long waiting lines overall a very amazing happy experience ,5,2018-10-20
1792,Bring out the child in you.,this is our first trip to disneyland park and we were excited to be there we spent the whole day at the park and had a wonderful time there coming from singapore this place is so huge with lots of activities and awesome ride to choose from there were section of theme such as frontier land fantasy land adventure land tomorrow land just to mentioned a few for you to explore as usual the park tend to get crowded as the day goes by and there were a halloween party during my visit there there s also plenty of eateries and souvenirs shop around for you to dine and get some mementos to bring back home you need to be here to experience the great atmosphere the ride the crowd the staff as well as the disney characters made our trip full of wonderful memories this place will really bring out the the child in you ,5,2018-10-19
1793,Something is Missing,it kills me to rate disneyland with only three stars we are such huge fans of disney and have been to disney world several times but our first trip to disneyland left us feeling that it was lacking something i will say the park is clean and kept up wonderfully if you do your research you will know how to keep your wait times down to a minimum snacks and meals were great rides are fun and attention to details are awesome so what was missing the customer service the cast members just did not seem to have that magical touch that cast members in disney world has i know not every cast member is perfect and you will always encounter that one that just doesn t shine but we encountered several at disneyland cast member that couldn t be bothered to find the answer to a simple question where do we pick up our halloween part wristbands and redirected me to another part of the park to just repeat my question cast member at nemo s submarine ride yelling for someone to cover for her because she had to pee repeatedly really you need to announce that to the whole line no friendly conversation with cast members while in line or while they waited on us at blue bayou monotonous dull tour guides in jungle cruise and storybook canal boat rides characters had no handlers to guide them and fans so we only took one picture with rey and even that was in and out like a photo op at a comic con and i can t tell you how many times the fast pass turnstiles were ignored because cast members were busy hanging out and chatting among themselves honestly i think we could have saved our max pass money and walked right through they would not have noticed nor do they seem to care no one lining main street with big smiles and bigger hellos when we entered the park in the morning and no one at the exits waving goodbye history cleanliness fun details sure magic no ,3,2018-10-19
1794,What can I say? It’s Disneyland!,fantastic experience that will not disappoint from the rides to the fireworks display at the end of the day it s hard to fault fun for all ages just be prepared for long lines for rides and being very busy no matter what day you go ,5,2018-10-18
1795,Great Place but Queues Consistently Let it Down,as you d expect it s a great place which only sometimes shows its age in lack of modern facilities but the queues are immense and let the whole experience down consistently the money grabbing aspect also lets it down severely with pure profiteering involved in the pricing of food and drinks and other things like phone charging while to be expected very poor ,4,2018-10-18
1796,Mickey's Disneyland Halloween Party,we decided to purchase tickets to the halloween party and weren t disappointed shorter lines able to get into the park at pm and then stay for the party all the way until pm plenty of places throughout disneyland to collect halloween candy we beat the crowds for utah fall break by going days early and that will be when we go from now on well worth the and we enjoyed riding everything we wanted to tip pay attention to closing times for both parks and start at california adventure first and then come over to disneyland since it is open longer ,5,2018-10-18
1797,Disneyland - A place to go,age doesn t matter but a must place to go i went with my family there and had a great time all rides activities are awesome my daughter had great time in meeting all the princess though she had to stand in queues for around hr all princess are not in one park few are in second adventure one park so plan as per that your tickets will decide in which park you can go so go through the website i ll highly recommend fastpass which is cheap and will save your time by skipping the line and you can schedule your rides with the help of fastpass the other advantage of fastpass is pictures you don t need to carry camera there will be good numbers of photographers from disney who will take your picture and will link with your fastpass you can download them later disney app is not good one very slow and poor response but its good to have it ,5,2018-10-18
1798,Disney California,i am in love with disney amazing atmosphere great attractions so many different fun and even if you adult you find awesome fun there ,5,2018-10-18
1799,Always a great time!,took our kids to disneyland for their first time and it was great they adored all the characters decorations rides and attractions and the whole disney magical feel where a kid can be a kid and an adult can too disneyland doesn t disappoint of course prepare to wait in lines as this is a main attraction for many but it s all worth it prepare to also do a lot of walking with comfortable shoes i made sure my kids had durable comfortable shoes and it really helped you won t be disappointed and neither will the kids ,5,2018-10-18
1800,stolen money,this was my rd visit to disneyland with my family always had a wonderful time unfortunately this last visit was spoiled with the fact i had my money stolen out of my purse which was in my handbag at the security screening by security staff please try not to be alone especially once it starts to get dark try and keep your money on your person hope this helps and it doesn t happen to you ,1,2018-10-18
1801,Great second experience,second time for the wife and i taking our son for his first time wow its kinda weird but you become again and it just overwhelms you you cant help but be swept up in the magic ,4,2018-10-18
1802,Lots of fun,disneyland is a lot of fun lots of rides attractions shows and food my husband and i have been twice and it was a great time both times the lines get long and the crowds get crazy here but rhe attractions are fun disney world is a better park by leaps and bounds but disneyland is the original and worthy of the trip ,4,2018-10-17
1803,Nice experience,as it was our first time in la we took the kids to disney had a great time but was disappointed we didn t get on a few more rides the queues were just too long and the day isn t long enough to get on everything after visiting florida disney on many occasions over the last years we were slightly disappointed with this park although most of the rides are the same the park seems much smaller and crushed in the best thing about it was the queues were easier to bear as the temperatures are lower in ca than fl ,3,2018-10-17
1804,It’s Disneyland!!!,it is a pretty amazing place a bit pricey specially if you do the max pass but you know what your getting into before you go ,5,2018-10-17
1805,Amazing 1st Visit with my family,we had an amazing time visiting disneyland we purchased a day park hopper max pass and it was worth spending the extra money to have access to both parks fast pass and photo s it was also great to be able to do the fast pass right from the app we can t wait to go again ,5,2018-10-16
1806,Horrible Security Check in.,why is it the some of the check in people checking bags take a glance and let people go thru while others are digging to the bottom of a bag or purse the people doing that cause those lines to take for ever as the others ones are moving nicely taking a flash light to look into a small bag what are you looking for young teenage girls from a soccer team what do you think they are trying to sneak in ,2,2018-10-16
1807,An unforgettable family experience,what visited disneyland with our sons ages the park is definaelty catered to the younger ages children as my boys are very much into the thrill rides however there were afew rides for them a must see is the light show and the guys fawkes which only show on certain days so be sure to check the website and it s an evening thing so if you have a day pass make sure for one of the days you start later in the day to be there for the shows cos there both a must see fastpass is a must as it was extremely busy there,4,2018-10-16
1808,My son's first trip!,what an incredible place as a child i loved disney and as an adult i was transported back into those moments of wonder and awe it is so clean and well kept staff are amazing and helpful it was truly our favorite vacation so far and we go adventure a lot we ll be back for christmas ,5,2018-10-16
1809,Birthday Trip,my husband and myself were celebrating my birthday stopped at town square to get a birthday button all day long employees and other guests wished me a happy birthday so wonderful to be at the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-10-16
1810,Magical obviously,the happiest place on earth as they say disneyland has a magical atmosphere especially with the fancy names of rides and restaurants was slightly disappointing that the characters don t pop up more often like they used to years ago but it s quite organised that they have characters in different locations at particular times for autograph signing food is very expensive and there isn t enough choice for vegetarians considering people visit from all over the world overall disney has a way to bring out the kid in everyone and we deffo made the most of our th trip,4,2018-10-16
1811,Mixed Feelings,it is probably the happiest place to be at a theme park where everybody are cheerful adults and kids alike beautiful buildings perfectly designed and decorated enjoyable rides lovely shows especially fireworks in the eve and parades kids will meet their favorites characters and get into their houses mickey minnie etc boutique that will transform your little ones to princesses and shops selling disney merchandises lots of special snacks and numerous choices of places to eat ok that was the best part of the picture unfortunately it is over crowded the fast pass thing is rubbish you will have to wait in a queue at each ride for about two hours prices are exorbitant we spent an entire day at only one park but we didn t ride more than rides i guess it s not a place for one day to explore you will need at least a week in there so you should be ready with the appropriate budget ,4,2018-10-16
1812,Busy,the park was really busy but our early entry helped by though things were getting pretty stacked up ,5,2018-10-16
1813,Great ! but too short a visit,we were in cali for our cousin s wedding and have never been to disneyland we bought a hopper for day unfortunately this was all the time we had for a saturday and it was not enough we did receive st visit pins from a cast member we had a great view for the the fantasmic show there was just so much to do rides and show wise for your st time you really need more then a day to do it all we will have to go back tip if you have kids try to get disney toys in advance or at a walmart we only purchased items and it was over ,5,2018-10-15
1814,AWful,i went to disneyland on i am not new to disney i have been to disneyland at least times disney world and to the aulani resort once let s start with the drive in waited in line for min to park from parking it is a walk to the tram which we had to wait trams before arriving at the park we already had tickets but the line to get in with tickets was about minutes it was so crowded that there were hrs waits for most attractions fastpass was either not available or available during the pm am slot there were three extremely rude disney staff there i had never experienced that one staff was yelling so loudly in the restroom the bday girl had to hold her ears and looked terrified three kiddos between the ages of one bday girl age were unable to do more than attractions in hours navigating through the park was like driving on the during bad traffic it was not only crowded it was like a can of sardines awful never experienced this before and if there are many days like this now in the park there will eventually be less customers when the day is so overcrowded as this day was admissions should be limited so some enjoyment can be had from families spending magical funds no so cal discount no one day discounts awful disney is does not provide the mgic and happiness it once did ,1,2018-10-15
1815,Disneyland,somewhat overpriced due to large crowd and time it takes to get on rides some rides were and hour long lines ,4,2018-10-15
1816,Had Fun; but at Premium Price!!,enjoyed visit however been there done that will not go back certainly not family price sensitive food souvenirs overpriced thought about overpriced in value ,3,2018-10-15
1817,Happiest place on earth with Maxpass,this was our th visit to disneyland by far the most enjoyable using the maxpass we usually try visit in non peak times but it s disneyland it s always going to be busy maxpass was a breeze to use we got on everything more than once made our time at this magical place much less stressful enjoyable especially as we only had one day there this time the photo pass was an added bonus too great work disneyland ,5,2018-10-15
1818,Everyone is a child at heart,walt disney it was said to be classified as almost nuts when he started construction of the disneyland resort in anahiem if mr disney was still alive i wonder what he would make of such a magical place the creative spirit to turn stories into rides and looking at ways to deal with long waits in lines being in line at various times of years can be long however the line itself seems to become part of the ride i suggest avoiding holiday periods and weekends although going to the park over halloween and christmas i think is very special leave that moping adult at the entrance and let go and have fun collect a programme upon arrival download the app on your phone and have fun,5,2018-10-14
1819,Still a Magical place but some tips that might help.,first disney moved tram loading to the lower level of the mickey and friends parking structure they also moved security there as well you now go through security before you get on the tram this is real time savor max pass max pass is great however one thing i noticed my family linked their passes on one phone and got fast passes for the haunted mansion at i got a fast pass on my phone at the same time at it was for it seems like when you link passes to one phone your next pass will take longer than if everyone gets their own pass try linking for one ride then unlinking for another you can get a fast pass for one park while in another max pass also lets you view and share pictures with others who have a max pass in my opinion it is worth the price another time saver is the single rider line me my wife and daughter all got into the single rider line for radiator springs racers the wait time was minutes we got on in minutes my wife and daughter got in the same car and we all ended up going together guardians of the galaxy and radiator springs racers will run out of fast passes very early followed by haunted mansion and space mountain you can no longer walk from guardians to cars land cars land is worth the wait to see it lit up at night disneyland is crowded and expensive but i chose to go there knowing all of this ,5,2018-10-14
1820,"Disappointed, broken rides and long lines",a large number of broken rides including the cars ride pay the extra and get the fast pass mobile app to speed up the process and get on more rides quicker ,2,2018-10-14
1821,Great family day experience,we visited this park on our first day in anaheim in a party of and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves average wait times were approx to mins so we didn t need to utilise many fast passes it was very well organised and the kids and adults all enjoyed themselves as there was something for everyone to enjoy i was happy with the eating places as it was not all burgers and pizza there were several more healthier options to try and i thought that the prices were reasonable for a theme park we took water bottles and refilled them at the park as it was quite a warm day when we visited ,4,2018-10-14
1822,NO Fireworks or nightly parade,i ve been going to disneyland for years the park was extremely crowded yet they told us they aren t doing fireworks because it s their slow season if you want a nighttime parade you ll need to go to california adventure even on the non halloween party nights the bathrooms were a mess over half the hand towel dispensers were empty plus garbage all over the floor definitely not up to normal disney standards so i m not sure if they cut the staff as well overall not the experience we are used to ,2,2018-10-14
1823,A must do but prep yourself beforehand,i would have starred it except for the crowds of prams and endless kids but it s disneyland so i get it my kids are and while we all enjoyed it our preference was california adventure park less crowded more thrill rides for their and adults liking flawless disney execution and really amazing design easy entry and many great memories ,4,2018-10-14
1824,"Really busy day, fastpass system down!! People drunk in Disneyland!!",we were in disneyland for our th anniversary on october th we knew this would be an extremely busy day a saturday halloween time and gay days we re disney veterans and were prepared until the maxpass and fastpass system went down i have recently developed a back issue making standing very difficult so the failure of this paid system really interfered with our strategy for the day at one point the wait for the haunted mansion was minutes it all turned to be a bust most disappointing is the fact that disney has made no effort to even apologize or more for the failure of a prepaid system it is also disappointing that the parks can t get a better handle on the amount of alcohol people consume we had folks in front of us in line at a restaurant who wreaked of booze were loud and obnoxious all in all a pretty disappointing day in the magic kingdom ,3,2018-10-14
1825,It’s Disney!!,of course no expense is spared when going to disney very fun trip lots to do went on a weekday so it was not as crowded great for all ages ,5,2018-10-14
1826,No review will change you're mind. If you're going you're going but travel smart.,when it comes to disneyland there are three types of people the people who love disney no matter what their age the people who are doing the obligatory taking the kids trip and the people who are never going that being said anyone who is reading reviews isn t doing so to decided whether or not to go they re reading it for the tips i fall into the second to third category of people but am happy to share my recent experience to make someone else s better we went for days with the husbands kids and grandkids here are a couple of pointers and things i found first download the disneyland app and also pay the extra i think it was for the hubs and i for days for the max pass this allows you to do multiple things first you can book fast passes from your phone rather than having to walk to the ride and then come back at a certain time also it allows you to have multiple fast passes at a time and let s you know when you are eligible to book your next one other cool features are that it let s you connect and keep all of your pictures in one place let s you book food or restaurant reservations gives you wait times for all of the rides for both disney and california adventure and tells you where characters are appearing and at what times you can also keep you tickets on your phone so you don t have to worry about paper tickets honestly the app was the biggest hidden gem of the park we were there on a sunday and monday and it was packed it didn t help that it was gay pride canadian thanksgiving and columbus day all at the same time as a result the park was at max capacity both days what i found helpful was starting about a week before check the app and note the popular rides when you first get into the park go straight to one of them and then start fastpassing a second a third due to the amount of people in the park this was the only way we got to do the rides we wanted also i would say is your best opportunity to wait in the shortest lines by noon both days fastpasses were sold out and lines were hours long even trying to get pictures with characters was hour long wait times don t take kids younger than we were there with a and year old and it seemed overwhelming for them and like they didn t quite get it they weren t super into the rides if at all so it was a lot of eating a shopping and doing smaller things it s a lot of money to pay for the kids not to get the full experience not saying all kids will be like this but in general it seemed that way for the younger ones pack the least amount of stuff with you as possible hubs and i didn t even take bags in just phones and sunglasses he wore cargo pants to carry id s a cc s and i wore cheap sunglasses so i wouldn t have to worry about them getting damaged or lost this helped for getting through security and also with rides and the amount of people less is more if you have kids and need to take bags etc just take the minimum of what you need the one item i recommend especially if you are using the app is an extra battery charger and cord i have a anker charger i got from amazon that gives your phone about charges and is pretty small to pack you will be taking pics and using your phone with the app so you ll want to keep it charged disney has a few kiosks where you can rent a charger but it was about of a charge do yourself a favor and bring your own plan on dropping some coin especially if you have kids disney ears alone were a piece and i don t think we had a meal that was less than for people and we are just talking sandwiches and chips the balloons were plus each and with a couple of kids it adds up fast last year the hubs and i did a three week europe trip and spent total and we could have easily spent more than that for a few days in disney go in knowing everything is expensive and make a budget of what you are and are not willing to pay for finally stay off the property we stayed about a minute walk away but some other family members opted to stay at the disneyland grand hotel while the location is great you are basically paying plus a night to shorten your walk and maybe get a few other things that you have to pay extra for for example my husbands daughter paid to have the room decorated it was cool because it looked like mickey had been there and the kids got a few keepsakes but other than that it was a basic double hotel room with about a minute shorter walk to the entrance of the park for us staying a minute walk away we saved several thousand dollars got away from the crowds for a bit and got breakfast with our room which saved us from spending breakfast money in the park the last time i was in disney was and i remember it being far more fun and magical to me it seems like an over priced and over crowded tourist trap but also if you have kids or grand kids a necessary evil at least once at this point i can say it s been checked off my bucket list and i don t need to go back read as much as you can and get as many pro tips as possible to make your visit easy and fun ,3,2018-10-14
1827,Halloween fun!,our family found that october was a great time to visit disneyland the weather was perfect for us not too hot only one morning of rain park was not too busy we were able to go on all the rides we wanted to do the max pass worked well for us for fastpass rides the photopass our grand daughters enjoyed the princess for a day experience as well as the jedi training we had a great disneyland experience ,5,2018-10-14
1828,Always fun,the disneyland resort park was fun we went on a friday and they were closing early for the halloween event i highly recommend the maxpass especially when the crowds grow in the afternoon it was easier to use the dl app to reserve fast passes rather than go to the ride to retrieve one when a ride is down and you have a fast pass for that ride you can return later or use the active fast pass on any other ride splash mountain and space mountain both were down at times otherwise we had a great time ,4,2018-10-14
1829,Disneyland is always magical,disneyland is always magical but i would recommend checking the weather before you plan your trip get a fast pass to save time and arrive at the parade site earlyto catch a great view the food is not that great so grab breakfast at one of the diners across the road denny s is my favourite and their coffee is great before entering,5,2018-10-13
1830,Disney not fun,the park was to crowded it was absolute wall to wall couldn t even walk getting food was a nightmare and very expensive disney has gone downhill and the service is affected due to overcrowding ,2,2018-10-13
1831,Lost its magic.,the previous time i went here was when the kids were still little now they are teens i guess about years and oh boy how crowded it has become different too all the mad hatter store has now are these mouse ears for each they turned the baked goods place into a starbucks which means not many baked goods there are lines for the restrooms for the guest services i guess if you lose your child you ll have to stand in line to pick her up too i had hopes that it would be less crowded on monday but no so in the end we only did fastpass rides and left when we ran out not going back anytime soon ,1,2018-10-13
1832,New Rides,we have not been in disney for years we really enjoyed all the new rides and attractions we can t wait to come back ,5,2018-10-13
1833,Family visit,we enjoyed our days at disneyland the first day was columbus day so it was extremely busy the next day was quieter but still lots of people we got all the rides done we wanted to and we left feeling happy the park us kept very clean and it s run very efficiently if you don t mind waiting in lines or crowds of people you ll have a great time ,3,2018-10-13
1834,Great to Be Back!,what a hoot we usually do disneyland or disney world in the fall after school starts back up so although we expected the park to be busy this was still a bit overwhelming it was really packed still got to see and do everything we wanted to but that was only because we have been many times and therefore skipped parts that we knew we didn t care about we were there for seven hours and were able to ride thunder mountain guardians star tours buzz lightyear pirates of the caribbean and the haunted mansion however with the park this busy there s no way a first timer could do the whole thing in one day that said no matter what this is disneyland truly the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-10-13
1835,So busy,fun but super crowded of the days we visited really like the new maxpass option without it we couldn t have ridden most rides as the wait times were unbearable too bad it s becoming hard to find any low times to visit ,4,2018-10-13
1836,Great Fun If Done Right,if you combine maxpass with the extra magic morning you can see yourself up to barely wait for anything the park itself is clean aging a bit but being worked on and still has that disney charm the crowds later in the day make it tougher especially around parade time the only real knock is that there aren t enough good food options ,4,2018-10-12
1837,A dream come true,it s been my dream to visit disneyland since the age of i ve experienced disney world all my life however this park has a deeper connection to walt s ultimate vision disneyland has a nostalgic feeling from the moment you walk in walt s memory still lives in the park i felt his presence as i walked down main street i closed my eyes and began to cry because it was so breathtaking the rides are still in great working conditions cast members are the sweetest i visited the park for mickeys halloween party and a regular park day the maxpass is in my opinion the best way to see disney photos and fastpass services included i honestly can t wait to return ,5,2018-10-12
1838,Magical day solo!,even though i was solo since hubby was attending a conference i had such a nice day this place is just amazing favorite rides indiana jones so so cool splash mountain pirates of the carribean and it s a small world if you are going solo like i did make advantage of the single rider system i saved so much time doing that ,5,2018-10-12
1839,So much fun,first time at disneyland and we loved it a must do for any disney lover we got to do the rides that we have heard about for years but never experienced nemo subs is one of the best ,5,2018-10-12
1840,Yearly adventures,we go every year but i think our favorite time has to be halloween i love the christmas decor but halloween here for mickeys party is amazing halloween else where will not compare yet the lines move fast and the kids collect sooo much candy even moms and dads and the lines for rides are basically non existent also sally and jack come out for photo ops woohoo,5,2018-10-11
1841,Perfect day at Disneyland,today was a great day for disneyland rides were anywhere from to minutes long crowds weren t too bad since it s not the halloween party night stars because womens bathroom lines everywhere were out the door felt like that line was longer than some of the ride lines ,4,2018-10-11
1842,One day visit!,we only had one day to visit this place so we chose disneyland park over the adventure park i would highly recommend to buy express entry if you want to cover maximum rides that would save a loads of time we liked it it was like refreshing the childhood memories ,4,2018-10-11
1843,Family vacation,i had been to disneyland when i was and was so excited that i could return with my husband and boys and we all had an amazing time must fast pass and if you can avoid taking a bag your entry is faster only disappointment waa that we didnt really see the characters much and the parades were pixar only would have loved to have seen the older characters such as goofy and pinocchio in a parade that being said if you did spot a character you could line up for a pic i would love to see tge characters just wandering around main street near each land entry for most the day park was very clean and even though it was very crowded there was no pushy behaviour i really hope i am blessed enough that i may return again one day ,5,2018-10-11
1844,Family holiday,disneyland is fantastic a truly well oiled machine definitely need sunscreen hat and good walking shoes take advantage of the early morning entry if staying at the disneyland hotels and research the rides that you want to go on in order to prioritise and utilise on the fast pass ,5,2018-10-11
1845,The happiest place...,and the longest line ups to enter the park security has to shine a flash light in every compartment of every bag archaic in a time when scanners are available so you line up for security line up for x ray line up at the gate to hurry to the rides and line up rules change without notice such as no fast passes left or only every hours dependent on crowds of course this is only after customers have paid for passes this said all workers are pleasant and have scripts available when customers express a concern smile listen and provide the script smile listen and same script i hope service can keep up with crowds in future ,3,2018-10-10
1846,Happiest Place on Earth,have been many times and i love it each time i go although each time there are always a few rides that are out of service space mountain and indiana jones are musts ,5,2018-10-10
1847,A Classic - We Love the Original!,we have been going to wdw for many years and this was essentially my first trip to disneyland other than when i went at age and have no memory of i wasn t sure if i d like it as much as wdw or how i d feel but i was very excited to go to the place where it all began i was just thrilled with the park and in many ways there were aspects i liked a lot more than wdw it is more compact than magic kingdom with about the same amount of rides so it was much more crowded and congested and very few places to sit and relax also we didn t get to ride peter pan because we didn t want to wait in the perpetually long line no fast passes however there was so much we loved about disneyland the convenience to our hotel no disney busses was wonderful we loved park hopping and heading to downtown disney it was all right there some of the rides are better in california pirates buzz lightyear train haunted mansion nightmare before christmas plus all the fun rides that aren t in florida indiana jones alice in wonderland mr toad roger rabbit etc also the theming of the lands and rides was better in california every ride made sense where it was located and fit in perfectly we had a lot of great table service and quick service meals too fast passes worked out great we got to ride everything we wanted to but it was really crowded and difficult to even walk during the evening fantasmic and fireworks shows we definitely plan to come back to disney again in the near future we had a great time ,5,2018-10-10
1848,Lots of options for little ones!,we had a wonderful time there it was not supposed to be crowded according to crowd calendars but i did think it was quite busy and some lines were long which makes it difficult with two very young kids it is natural to compare with orlando and the possibility of getting fastpass for almost everything which does not happen at disneyland so in that sense we could not go to all the rides we wanted to as it would be too tiring for the kids but we definitely enjoyed it a lot and we were able to go to many since a lot of the rides do not have a minimum height limit we really enjoyed a lot of options we really enjoyed buzz lightyear it is definitely one of our favorite ones we got to go twice on the same day and the classicals like small worls dumbo storybook canal finding nemo space mountain single rider line was really helpful as only my husband and i could go and we needed to go separately highlight for the kids was toontown they loved every bit of it and had major fun to greeting the characters including goofy and pluto that were just walking around ,5,2018-10-10
1849,Exactly as expected,we visited during on a day hallowe en was on in the evening so had to be out by pm some areas were closing at pm to prepare so check opening hours to see if affected we were aware and opening hours were fine for us you will need an extra ticket to stay in evening we bought our tickets at our anaheim hotel and saved each on gate pass on a day ticket we also purchased max pass which allowed us to make fast pass reservations online and also provided us with photos from main rides and from the photographers onsite we had a brilliant day my wife enjoyed all the rides and the park was well laid out and maintained easily to see what you want in a day,5,2018-10-10
1850,"Disneyland, so Much More Than the Average Amusement Park!",there is a reason why disneyland is a must go place everyone should visit it at least once in their lives the feeling i get while being there is indescribable as soon as i arrive i can taste the jubilance in the air and hear joyous cheers it all around vibrant balloon venders on every corner just handing smiles out to children it brings nostalgia in just about every way possible whether it being the clean scent of the pirates of the caribbean s water or the way children laugh when seeing their favorite characters every little thing there just takes me back to pleasant memories that i have had on previous visits on top of all the brilliant memories disneyland also has enchanting rides for all ages memorizing shows and delightful food which makes it a perfect spot for family vacations or even anniversaries there is just so much to do and so much to see it is impossible to get bored of disneyland something that always excites me about going to disneyland is the abundance of rides which to me is probably the best part about this park whether it is a smooth relaxing story book ride or a ride with such a sharp drop that makes my stomach feel as if it s bounding into my chest however i m sure everyone can agree that disneyland s coaster rides are the best for instance the fan favorite space mountain a ride that no one should miss one reason is that i am astounded by the brilliant visuals every time i ride once the ride launches to full speed it gives the feeling of soaring through a starry galaxy at sonic speeds it is an enjoyable feeling all the random twists and turns only add to the thrilling experience also it has an amazing soundtrack that sounds like it came out of an old fashioned sci fi movie though space mountain is an exceptional ride my favorite ride has to be splash mountain splash mountain is a take on the classic log ride except in disney s version it has cute animals and multiple very steep drops though the highest of the drops measures only at ft the angle at which feels like it is nearly degrees makes it a gut wrenching experience the feeling is thrilling and always makes me let out a scream of joy before crashing into the water below and having it come up and deliver a slap to the face though i only talked about two rides every ride in disneyland is worth checking out though rides are part of what makes the mouse kingdom so amusing they aren t the only thing there is to experience one reason i prefer this amusement park to others is the brilliant shows and parades with music and lights that reach out and praise the sky the live performances are magical one performance in particular is fantasmic this brilliant show had some of the most stunning visuals and some intense music the blasts and pops of fireworks and the blaring of classic disney songs that we all love another visual element that brings fantasmic to life is the use of pyrotechnics with every fiery blaze the heat releases itself into the crowd this causes an overhaul of excitement to raise in the audience as we all watch our favorite characters go across stage followed by outstanding visuals another stunning performance that you i greatly appreciate is the light up the night parade each float and each performer are decorated with an array of vibrant colors that brighten up the area all around them while brilliant neon s and lovely dark blues cast heavenly shadows on the ground delightful music fills the air which just really delivers what visiting disneyland is all about following the exhilarating rides and the over the top performances the mouse kingdom has an enormous selection of sweet treats most of them themed in adorable classic character shapes on every corner there is the fresh scent of fresh bread and delightful cinnamon all around there are stands that contain various delicious treats one of those being the churro which is one of my favorite snacks they are absolutely wonderful cinnamon twists with a flurry of sweetness that consumes my taste buds though they aren t original to disneyland they are still the go to snack on my trips another popular sweet around disneyland are beignets these delightful powdered pastries are warm to the touch and sweet to the scent they are just so airy soft and delectable on top of being delicious they are adorable each beignet is shaped like the mascot of disneyland mickey mouse which is just another reason to love them and to love the park disneyland is so much more than the average amusement park there isn t anything that there isn t to love within it i can take a ride through space go on adventures with my favorite characters and deliver delightful new tastes to my taste buds however it still is so much more than any of those things since there is so much to do in disneyland it is a place to for new memories to be born every moment i spend there fills me with enchantment no matter how many times i visit the jubilant feeling never fades it is all the beauty in the parks design that just sweeps me off my feet every time the environment is just one that reminds me of the abundance of wonderful memories i made during past visits even as i grow old i will continue to revisit it for it is truly the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-10-10
1851,First time in Disneyland Park!,living on the east coast we have been to wdw more times than you can imagine always wanted to see disneyland we found the park to have that original first park feel like the idea that the kiddie classic rides are still a part of it did not comes with kids but rode them anyway we were disappointed that the matterhorn was down for refurb but the overlay of the haunted mansion more than made up for it the halloween decorations were over the top which we loved noticed that the walkways are not very generous which gave it that very crowded feeling this is definitely a con i did read recently that the benches may be removed are you kidding me they are much needed for a brief rest from time to time please reconsider while there we did the mickey s halloween party i really feel just like wdw in orlando that they oversell on tickets it was not that easy to get on attractions the parade was uncomfortably crowded as well as the fireworks walt would not like the greediness all in all we truly enjoyed the park loved not having to hop on and off buses all day had one of our best meals in carnation cafe very cute litte cafe with good food loved the old fast pass system but did not understand one thing the paper that comes out with your time is not used at all as far as handing it in it is all on your pass which is scanned at the attraction waste of paper maybe i would definitely recommend a trip to disneyland great fun bucket list checked ,4,2018-10-09
1852,Wonderful Princesses!,i have visited disneyland countless times and every time is a different adventure this time we visited with our little princess who is turning four years old after a visit to the boutique and a transformation into an adorable cinderella princess our little one was able to meet the disney princesses this is a shout out to ariel cinderella and snow white you all went over the top to make our little princess feel special interacting with her ariel showed her how to twirl a princess dress cinderella had her use the magic words and her magic wand to put more sparkles on her dress snow white was wonderful also our little one was completely enchanted and so was the rest of the family thank you ,5,2018-10-09
1853,Where Magic Lives, this is a combined review for both disneyland park and disney s california adventure disney has always held a place in my heart my entire life and i frequently visit walt disney world in florida every year this summer past however i went to the west coast for a change of scenery and i could not pass up the opportunity to visit the park that started it all and it s sister park disney s california adventure what can i say except the disney experience here is the same as anywhere amazing however each park and resort has its own original charm and there s something about disneyland ca that makes it feel special it may be a lot smaller in scope than wdw with it s four theme parks and two waterparks but it is a beautiful park that feels familiar yet different and unique the food is great the rides are great and it s great fun for not only the young but the young at heart too california adventure despite its mixed reviews i actually found myself enjoying very much as it was a breath of fresh air from wdw all be it full of mgm hollywood studios and epcot clones for the most part i could not recommend a visit to a disney resort anymore highly whether it be florida california paris or any of their other global resorts you get a similar experience at each but that is all the more reason to go as the saying goes if it ain t broken don t fix it and disney have the theme park industry down to perfection there s nowhere on earth quite like disney ,5,2018-10-09
1854,Such a cute park,we had a great time just walking around this park and comparing it to disney world it is much smaller but it makes it do able and not overwhelming to the senses it is a nice park and has a different feel to it i would have to say this park is more relaxed we will be back and will spend more time here ,5,2018-10-09
1855,USA Disney holiday stopover,my clan preferred the park much more than disneyland it is quite spectacular and has decent accessible rides if your finances only allow the choice between either disneyland and the park i would choose the park especially if your kids are a bit older the roller coaster ride is excellent fun and was a highlight we did itvseveral times ,4,2018-10-09
1856,My happiest place on earth,i ve been going since it s a wonderful place to go as an adult a great stress reliever as a child we would go spend a week there every year as an adult i spend a week there at least to times a year,5,2018-10-08
1857,The Happiest Place on Earth,once again disneyland has provided us with a magical visit we are huge disney fans and love visiting the original park we found this visit less crowded than our last the staff is helpful and great with our children we rode most attractions and had many character interactions my favorite part of this park is it s a small world this ride is better in california than florida we purchased the max pass which is a great value it gives you access to fast passes and the photo pass we found it very reasonably priced and everyone could be in our pictures my only complaint is that when we visited mickey there were no photopass photographers at mickeys house i think that if they offer this service at this location the star wars characters are a great addition to the park and my son enjoyed meeting characters that he had never seen before darth vadar and boba fett are only available here ,5,2018-10-08
1858,Disappointed,we took our two children to the disneyland park and was most disappointed with the lack of directions around the park there should more signs to direct you to various parts of the park each time we have to ask the staff for direction unfortunately we went on a sunday and the crowd was horrendous the wait for each ride was more than minutes the park should limit the maximum number of visitors each day so that the wait will not be that long our six year old child had enough after four hours in the park we paid about for a small bottle of water this must the most expensive bottle of water in this planet the entrance fees to the park is very expensive considering all the queues for the rides in the four hours at the park we managed three rides with the entrance fees of for adults and for children over this work out to be about a ride disneyland park is most overrated and not the time and money in the park also the equipments of the ride are getting old and worn c kok sydney ,1,2018-10-08
1859,Family vacation! First time to Disneyland,my children are ages and their heights are inches and about inches i say this as they were able to ride almost every ride in disneyland my youngest wasn t able ride indiana jones and i think that s it both had a blast be prepared to spend money as i found it s not cheap i think i spent roughly dollars a day for a family of four with water snacks and etc we purchased the day hopper and i d say it s recommended my last comment is to check the schedule of shows before going as apparently some do not have showings on certain days like the magical map of mickey doesn t have a showing tuesday wednesday or thursday i d download the disneyland app so you can see wait times schedule characters locations and times ,5,2018-10-08
1860,Great park for families or Disney lovers,this park was traditional disney lovely park showcasing lots of traditional disney characters and rides we went off peak and it was still packed depending on the time of day ride waits were to mins ,5,2018-10-08
1861,Walt's original happy place,we are used to wdw and we re surprised at how small the park was nevertheless we loved it as disney philes we marveled at the vision and greatly enjoyed soaking in the purity of walt s dream before the current company made it all about money very few of the rides empty out into gift shops ,5,2018-10-07
1862,Great day despite the heat,line ups were sometimes hours for the rides despite the fast passes you still had a bit of a wait disney itself was amazing as always better to go in off seasons when school is still in ,4,2018-10-07
1863,First trip for granddaughter,she is now years old and loved every minute of the trip she has pictures galore to share with her friends from her gifts she bought for her little sisters she loved the rides the characters even though she was outshined by younger children haha what a fantastic experience for her that she will never forget,5,2018-10-07
1864,The magic has gone,we visited this park during our week trip to california we were abit shocked on how much it cost but we thought we are only going here once so we had to do it i don t even know where to start we knew it would be busy but we checked crowd calendar and decided to visit on the quietest day we literally couldn t move i expected a busy day but it wasn t enjoyable at all all the magic was taken away by people pushing and shoving and us having push chairs rammed into us all day the queues were beyond a joke we even had express pass which was pointless as everyone seemed to have the same idea we queued for jungle cruise for about an hour to get near the front and be told it had broke and to go and visit another attraction the place has gone to pot it s no longer about making people happy and dreams coming true it s all about how much money they can bleed from you a meal itself cost us around dollars which was just basic scrambled egg and breakfast potatoes i don t know how it s actually possible for a full family to visit i feel sorry that people save all year round to go somewhere where you re basically in a queue to just walk i will definitely never be visiting this park or probably any other disney park again as it s all about greed now ,2,2018-10-07
1865,"Amazing, Wonderful, Excellent.. Once in a lifetime experience.",simply wow such a beautiful place created by disney went with my entire family during jul it was peak summer season thus the place was quiet crowded with many visitors one must go with bit of homework and planning as to what all to visit and please go early morning we reached around am and it was already crowded and there were long que for every ride though each ride was excellent be it the nemo ride of mountain thrill rides something to do for each age group best was the evening show of water laser which was mesmerizing and the late evening firework show was out of the world for me it is definitely one of those once in a lifetime experience tip use the infant or bay switch option in case you re travelling with a infant kid this was a very good feature ,5,2018-10-07
1866,Just magical,i ve been visiting disneyland for years now and the quality of the park never deteriorates the staff are extremely helpful and friendly the atmosphere is wonderful the attractions are impeccable i plan to return to disneyland again and again as i always have a wonderful time here ,5,2018-10-07
1867,Plan it well,great place but plan it well in advance first of all it is a waste to buy the express pass if you do then go punch it in the ride you want to go immediately don t delay you will be given a time slot for the ride they also indicate in your ticket the time you can punch for your next ride which will be a few hours away you then have to go to your chosen ride and punch in again at that time it is a real hassle but with the crowds i suppose this is the only way they can manage even though there is a map getting around is not easy ask for directions and you will save time better to get into the park earlier than the opening time you have to walk a lot you cannot do all the rides in one day choose in advance what interests you don t miss the soarin ride around the world skip the jungle cruise and the olivanders wand shop if you are an adult ,5,2018-10-06
1868,Happiest Place on Earth :),i ve come to disneyland for over years and each and every time i love it stay at a local hotel so if your tired you can rest and come back for more fun if you have little kids this is a huge plus always come early and stay late if you come back in the later evening all the little kids are tired and go home this opens up your chance to enjoy fantasy land rides with no wait always get fast passes to visit the main attractions if you have little ones get a stroller and buy a ballon on it that way you can find your stroller and anyone with you can find you start in tomorrowland and work your way to jungle land they have lockers if needed and always eat at the buffet type restaurants always wait until you leave to buy souvenirs so you don t have to carry them as it get later the lines shrink and you can almost walk on and off everything summer is not fun at disney with hot lines go in the spring or fall and you will enjoy it much more have fun and take lots of photos ,5,2018-10-06
1869,Things Fall Apart,it is sad that overcrowding and greed have basically ruined one of the previously best places in the world the bottom line is that there are too many people in the parks the lines are too long and you can barely move the walt disney company s brilliant solution charge you extra money to use their maxpass that system allows you to make fast pass reservations on your phone essentially you pay extra to get access to the fast pass system to save time you can also get new fast passes quicker than if you don t buy the maxpass more money for the mouse and you get a small break from the crowds then the system breaks down no refund offered at that point you can wait on another line for minutes for a single fast pass to make up for the fact that the maxpass you paid for is broken then all of the rides are backed up because the system is broken so you get in line and wait because well you re here and you paid then a mumbled announcement worse than a new york subway car sounds overhead after standing still for a few minutes you understand that what has happened is the ride has broken down while you have been waiting and there is no recourse other than to accept you just paid to do nothing for the past minutes at that point you realize that you just paid almost a for a day visit to the parks with a broken maxpass to wait in line for a broken ride which essentially amounts to goofy holding your arms behind your back while an obnoxious orange county teen spits in your face meanwhile you try to think back to the great memories you had when competent humans actually ran this place as for the people running it now they should be shown the door because it s one thing to overcharge for something that s a fun memory filled day it s another to provide an awful day of nothing as a long time disney fan and visitor it saddens me to say that universal studios has finally surpassed disney as a total well run experience ,1,2018-10-06
1870,It’s Disneyland,it s disneyland it s a wonderful place for kids and adults and overall it is amazing to see all the little details that go into it we went for our kids and they loved it but it suffers from what you d expect extremely expensive long lines crowded pretty much everywhere but you should expect that if you visit a place like this ,4,2018-10-06
1871,Expensive but a must do,haven t been here in over years so it was good to see how it s changed and how it has not it has become a bit over commercialized and very expensive ,4,2018-10-06
1872,Expectations surpassed,this park hits every mark and more for an amusement park that opened in disneyland is well maintained clean organised and all the cast members staff are courteous and helpful it truly is a magical place we had a day park hopper ticket visiting sunday wednesday and only just saw rode everything on our list i recommend the maxpass system as it worked very well and also included photopass which meant we weren t having to ask other visitors to take our family photos wait times did not seem particularly onerous if you get the chance ensure you catch fantasmic as it is amazing and comes complete with fire breathing dragon disneyland is awesome but do your research by following a few blogs before your first visit ,5,2018-10-06
1873,Just fun!!!!!!,plan and take your time this will save going back and forth especially with children in tow it s worth a few extra days so you can revisit your favourites over and over take time to notice all the fun things around decor etc etc the security now to get into these parks was great after all who doesn t want to be safe in this day and age it was done in a friendly efficient manner both at ca and dl entrances although the main gate could do with a couple more metal detectors at peak times as all lines converged its great to stay within walking distance can then just go back for a rest and refresh etc my iphone would not pick up wi fi so unfortunately could not get max pass which meant running back and forth to get fast passes after fireworks if you want to get to fantasmic you will have walk around the long way through frontierland so leave time for this or do on separate nights ,5,2018-10-06
1874,Disneyland first time,so much to do see it s amazing just enjoy it take it all in allow for long waits have a list or plan of what you d like to see and do for each day this is great as a reference as there is so much and you might change when you see something else walking around stick to your must do and everts ese as you see it water rides you can get very wet so take change of clothes for bottoms and wear summer shoes if you can we packed thongs flip flops and took a small towel everyone is friendly staff and visitors are all so nice it truely is a wonderful place enjoy it ,5,2018-10-05
1875,Disneyland is an evil genius,i love this place i definitely recommend getting an annual pass if you live in southern california every season they change the food and drink menu yes their prices are a bit high but you can always bring your own lunch and liquid containers the fireworks show change every season the parades change every season i love meeting the characters and dressing up my nieces in costume depending on the season there are different characters you can meet they have rides for all different ages they also have shows and an area that is all star wars my favorite place is tea cup area at night it s magical and a great place to watch the fireworks ,4,2018-10-05
1876,old.. GO HOLLYWOOD-STUDIOS,its smal old and dirty construction rubish and faded colors everywhere i was in other disneylands and this one is simply bad it doesn t deserve the name disneyland go in hollywood stuidos trust me so much more worth for the money ,1,2018-10-05
1877,"Fireworks, meet your stars, adventures, classic stories and exhilarating thrills, all here",spectacular fireworks in front of sleeping beauty castle walkthrough in late evening unique spectacular parade of all disney characters around pm are the key highlights of the park take space early otherwise not able to have good view of these two events star wars characters in tomorrowland and surprise appearances by some disney characters are the other surprise for us the best part is we were able to talk to them clicked pictures rubs our shoulders and share your feelings with them disneyland railroad attracts kids disneyland park is divided into extravagantly themed lands main street u s a tomorrowland fantasyland mickey s toontown frontierland critter country new orleans square adventureland the park opens at am do not be late you can be there beyond pm we took one day pass with max pass with max pass we make fast pass reservations while in the park through the disneyland app also it gives opportunity to download and save unlimited photo pass photos for the day we were able to do and enjoy indiana jones adventure haunted mansion space mountain star wars launch bay it s a small world matterhorn bobsleds and splash mountain rides and thrills ,5,2018-10-05
1878,Happiest place on earth.,really who doesn t have a good time in disneyland very close to disneyland bus only cost a dollar to go to mile to the front of disneyland you can t beat it ,5,2018-10-05
1879,Absolutely happiest place on earth,we had midweek days at disneyland and they were both amazing the lines were short longest we waited was about mins for a ride got to see many characters and get our photos taken best was seeing three princesses for photos only a min wait wonderful experience for the whole family can t wait to go back one day ,5,2018-10-04
1880,One-day visit? Get park-hopper,our family of six with kids ages and visited disney for day and i was very glad we splurged and got the park hopper option we selected our top rides in each park and along with two fast passes we managed to get on most of them the kids loved the haunted mansion star tours guardians of the galaxy the incredicoaster and soarin take a rest and cool down in the frozen show even though i know the movie inside and out the show was very entertaining plan to see a show at the royal theatre near the castle we saw a beauty and the beast performance that was top notch and lots of fun bring your water bottles to refill at fountains there is one in new orleans near the restaurants we found disneyland to be super crowded the pathways are more narrow than those in orlando it is easier to maneuver around california adventure park all in all disney is really fun for all ages and really requires and number of visits to do it justice ,4,2018-10-04
1881,Four Day Hopper,any visit to disneyland is magical but there were some issues the days we went hallowe en celebrations were underway so on the wednesday the park closed early unfortunately we didn t know until that morning tuesday lines weren t long tuesday and thursday but wednesday they were massive saturday was good used the four day hopper magical hour entry but found only fantasyland and tomorrowland rides open the fast passes made lines longer if they did not exist then maybe on our last day we bought the passes on the app and it was good the traditional rides were lovely with each one telling a story ,5,2018-10-04
1882,Disneyland amazing place,this has to be the best place on earth so clean so friendly my son spent his birthday here and had a ball,5,2018-10-03
1883,The Magic is Alive!,had a brilliant time with my girls aged after planning this trip for years definitely more crowded than it used to be but still great value for money if you have the right mindset highly recommend maxpass wouldn t go without it unless the parks were very quiet for some reason we also did the halloween party for the first time and it was great value for money i don t get the locals complaining about the cost we walked on all rides during the party and even stayed on splash for two goes without having to get off tons of candy parade and fireworks were brilliant would do again ,5,2018-10-03
1884,No Disney world but still fun,i love the attention to detail standing in line to ride an attraction can be just as fun if you notice the little things i will be back don t plan on more than a day or ,4,2018-10-02
1885,Best place on Earth,had the best time of our family treat this summer we enjoyed each ride but better if you have fast pass to be able to visit and ride the places ,5,2018-10-02
1886,Some good and some bad,first of all spend the money for a maxpass it makes all the difference if you plan out your trip you can make disneyland pretty enjoyable unfortunately disneyland has lost some of it s charm too many cast members weren t very friendly and many parkgoers were very rude while waiting in line at peter pan s flight we had several people cut in line ahead of us and one parent had his year old boy pee in the bushes right next to the ride the monorail was hot and stinky and lines were long we did stay at the grand californian for part of the trip which made the trip worthwhile ,3,2018-10-02
1887,Laid back.,we are disney fanatics we love disneyworld we got the chance to visit disneyland and it was so much fun it was so laid back we did the park in a whole day ,5,2018-10-02
1888,The park was very well organized and the wait times for the rides were very reasonable.,i would recommend visiting during the weekdays to avoid large crowds my daughter and i went on every ride we wanted to go and used the fast passes often to save time ,4,2018-10-02
1889,It is a magical place!,i can t say enough great thibgs about disneyland my kids and i had a great time its worth every penny i recommend the max pass and photo pass the longest we waited in line was mins we are going every year ,5,2018-10-02
1890,Daughters birthdayq,we had so much fun and the fast track works very well especially with a child who has adhd and add combined ,5,2018-10-02
1891,Romantic time for a young at heart couple!,i stole my wife away for a weekend due to a great deal on airline tickets we ended up flying to lax i then received a great deal on a hotel off season for tourists so i surprised her with a trip to disneyland you wouldn t think a trip to an amusement park would be so romantic we started off with a nice ride around the park on the train then we proceeded being kids all day we ended up enjoying ourselves so much we closed down the park at midnight it was so much fun to sit next to each other and enjoy all of the individual very unique experiences together please don t rule this option out for a romantic getaway this was one of our most memorable weekend trips ,5,2018-10-02
1892,Bus Parking,i like where the buses park now toy story parking lot lots of room no fighting with the reg cars taking our spots group can hop on the shuttle buses right there and be dropped off in the front this is more organized for us bus drivers ty,4,2018-10-02
1893,Best trip ever,went in august with my daughter and son in law first time for me in years and wow it was like stepping back in time i have a disability and every need was accommodating food was good staff in the park always had an answer for you it was busy but well worth it for me ,5,2018-10-02
1894,Birthday celebration,greatest place ever to celebrate a birthday i would definitely suggest the fast pass option also the park and restrooms are very clean and all the staff we encountered were very pleasant ,5,2018-10-02
1895,Here's tip...bite the bullet for a Max Pass,of course this place is good fun but if you are here when it s crowded it can be frustrating and disappointing to help avoid that i strongly recommend the max pass it s per person per day but even if you did it one day you would feel like you got your money s worth it allows you to maximize your fast passes getting them for either park from anywhere in either park it also allows free disney photos and ride photos but it s the fast pass management that really saves the day ,5,2018-10-02
1896,The Original and the Best!,disneyland is a very special place and there s no other place on earth like it this was mr disney s original creation and none of the other parks have its charm yes its too expensive to get in but every child in the world wants to go there i ve worked there and i ve been there many times and its run very well just be prepared to spend a lot ,5,2018-10-02
1897,Disneyland!,we are a big disney family and come to disneyland every couple of years we get park hopper tickets and stay in the paradise pier hotel there are many perks of staying in the disney hotels when visiting disneyland we enjoy it very much ,5,2018-10-02
1898,Food choices not very good,our recent trip with the family of members included vegans we found that very few places had decent choices for plant based eating in fact most of the food was not the healthiest anyway disneyland needs to step up and offer better nutritious eating ,2,2018-10-02
1899,Happiest Place On Earth,what can i say other then disney land took my expectations and blew them right out of the water i loved every minute of our days at the two parks we used the fastpass system on our phone which made the whole experience far more enjoyable as we didn t wait for any rides longer then mins maximum i am so glad we took our three girls to disneyland while they are still children but in saying that it took me years to get there and i found it just as magical and exciting as they did we are planning our next trip back ,5,2018-10-01
1900,THE BEST PLACE IN THE WHOLE WORLD,my absolute favourite place in the whole entire world this park is so magical gorgeous and full of wonder weather is always great grounds are always clean crowds are always fun and staff are always friendly this australian has made the trip to disneyland times in the last decade and probably spent the best part of three whole weeks across the trips this place never gets boring and is constantly changing and fresh and you can feel the spirit of walt as you wander around i d personally recommend you spend no less than atleast days at the park if your budget allows and you wish to see everything comfortably betweeen dlp and california adventure ,5,2018-10-01
1901,Poor directions for tram,if you are exiting the disneyland park and want to take the tram back to the structure make sure you make a right versus making a left to the parking shuttle we made this mistake and instead had to enter the park in a minute line at pm there are no real signs and after taking to customer service and the police officers at the gate they say this happens often and there s nothing they can do about it thank goodness we have season passes or we would have to pay a new fee to enter again truly disappointed ,1,2018-09-30
1902,More Magical with Kids,we went to disneyland in september myself daughter son in law and year old grandchildren we have been numerous times as adults but this was a first with small children there were special things we would never have seen without kids they were invited to play hide and seek with peter pan visited tinkerbelle in pixie hollow i never knew that existed met mickey mouse in his house etc we still did all the big rides and the kids were happy to do almost all of them we had great service from the cast members some really went out of their way to make us feel special we had a day pass for aussies kiwis and this was great as we could pace ourselves and the kids could have a nap in the afternoon we didn t have to feel we had to cram everything in we weren t fans of the halloween time theme halloween is not much of a thing in nz and i would have much preferred everything more traditional disney however it seemed very popular with the us visitors all in all a fantastic visit too crowded at times but we knew what to expect and made sure we arrived early in the morning looking forward to another visit in a couple of years,5,2018-09-30
1903,Loved it!!,must go and see once in your life it s pretty amazing whether your young or old this place brings you back some memory there s so much to see and do,5,2018-09-30
1904,Better than Florida!,having been to florida and paris i would say this is my favorite out of the three they have single rider options and with short wait times anyway we got round so many rides in our one day in the park we left no stone unturned ,5,2018-09-30
1905,Great Fun with Planning,my youngest daughter planned this excursion and we did all the rides without barely any if at all waits a few suggestions by her arrive early they have a new parking garage and then you take the tram sometimes they let you in earlier than stated we arrive minutes early go to your most wanted busiest rides first by afternoon the park is jammed get maxpass it s worth it some rides have single rider options it didn t help on indiana jones that much make reservations for lunch before you arrive sooner the better hit rides during the parade if you can avoid super busy times of the year i e holidays have a plan and most important have fun ,5,2018-09-30
1906,Disneyland,arrived am on thursday morning park was quite busy for this time entered tomorrowland and did the major rides with ease no fast pass neaded yet as the day progressed so did the crowd time for the fast pass managed to get around the park and get on the major attractions teen children didn t do any shows but made sure we did its a small world ride family favorite fast pass is a must especially if you make use of the digital download of photos later in the afternoon more and more people came ready for the nightly halloween celebration many families dressed as disney favorite or halloween costumes at this stage the park was too crowded main street was difficult to move about took the fun out of the day time to go home the parade was exceptionally fantastic as you would expect with disney lovely clean park good choice of food even for my wife who had a gluten free turkey sandwich which she enjoyed overall we enjoyed the day but even at the end of september the park was too busy merchandise is very expensive especially after admission fee car park food etc but disney have plenty of people hooked looking at amount of people walking around with mickey mouse ears shirts clothing etc we enjoyed the experience but hopefully don t need to do it again for a few year now thank you,4,2018-09-30
1907,Ghost Town days are gone forever!,no ap not a local have gone to disneyland times over years so enough times to see the changes and enjoy the updates this trip will be our last for awhile we understand crowds but the guest rudeness is just something we can no longer tolerate the cast members and attractions are amazing the park is beautiful and clean we will return some day ,4,2018-09-29
1908,Better than expected,this was a trip for the kids and i wasn t expecting much but to my surprise i enjoyed it a lot more than i thought probably because the kids had a ball there is no doubt it is a busy place but the maxpass was a godsend ,4,2018-09-29
1909,Fantastic and magical,disney land ia a great place for families some queues to dwal with but a multiple day passallows you the time ,5,2018-09-29
1910,Happiest place on earth,nothing is quite like the original disneyland the atmosphere the rides the dole whip the characters it s all uniquely disney you truly feel walt s vision with every step around the park disney always keeps it clean they are masters at keeping lines moving i visit every single year and the one thing the stood out expectations of the staff are changing snarky comments inpatients with guests that piece is for sure something walt didn t envision and for the sake of disney i hope they ll continue to have high expectations of their employees how they interact with guests they are so much of the experience and rude cast members take away from that experience ,5,2018-09-29
1911,Still great,magificent day spent at disneyland some classics that have stood the test of time didnt need fast pass as the longest we waited was minutes and we did all rides in the day it was busy but not overwhelming we and truly fleece you once inside the gates food was pretty ordinary and generic overpriced merchandise we found merchandise outside the park cheaper and it was made in the usa however we were there for the rides and the experiance and it didn t disappoint i had that young kid feeling as i arrived at the park which is always a great sign ,4,2018-09-29
1912,NOT,disneyland is many things but the happiest place on earth it is not don t get me wrong i love the place and have for years but it s full of hot tired grumpy people every time i go i love the rides but find the food to be bland and overpriced tip for an attitude adjustment take the monorail to the disneyland hotel and have a couple of cocktails ,5,2018-09-28
1913,"Halloween, Mickey & Dogs",two days in the park with service dogs be sure to stop at city hall for an accessible map it shows where to get inline with wheelchairs potty spots for service dogs and other information about accessibility most don t know this but any gates that open on a grassy area are spots for dogs to go potty they rode rides with us annie s favorites were it s a small world the rockets only a few the dogs can t ride and we did swaps versus using the provided kennels everyone was very accommodating and several cast members said we made their day with our dogs only caution at the parking garage beware of the security dogs they got super aggressive with my annie barking and lunging at her ,5,2018-09-28
1914,Enchanting big parks,we went to the first halloween night we were given hours before the closures of their normal operating hours it was nice to see the characters in halloween costumes the prices of the food was not as expensive as we thought the weather was just right for hours of walk ,4,2018-09-28
1915,Still enchanting,we must have been lucky as the crowds and queues were not too bad when we were there this might have had something to do with it being after the labour day long weekend to a certain extent i think you need to put up with the over priced food and drinks although i tend to agree that a little edge is being taken off the original ideal of disneyland however lets not be too picky disneyland is still magical even after several visits and your contributor getting a bit older probably past the thrill rides therefore the major themed attractions such as pirates of the caribbean jungle cruise and its a small world become even more important although still enjoyable these rides especially the jungle cruise are looking a little dated the haunted mansion was closed when we were there however issues such as this are likely to be required as the original disneyland gets older and will need revitalisation across a number of areas over the next few years ,4,2018-09-28
1916,Disappointed,we been there for fun day me and my wife and we was waiting for fantasmic show which is the best experience in disneyland then they told us that they cancelled in that day so u have to be sure that the show it showing in your visiting day really they spoiled our day,2,2018-09-28
1917,Best Family Fun,this was a three generational vaca of pure fun something for all of us to enjoy and all of us enjoyed it together ,5,2018-09-27
1918,Classic,having not visited disneyland for many years i went with my daughter and nearly year old grandson some things never change many rides are the same the layout of lands etc although we enjoyed ourselves there isn t a lot for tiny ones but fun nonethless disneyland really has mastered crowd control and despite the numbers of people it s easy to park get around park strollers find them again and of course their line management is the best highly recommend the newish little mermaid ride for an updated and colorful benign toddler experience peter pan is an oldie but goodie some rides like it s a small world are looking a little tired but still colorful and fun for little ones food and drink prices are outrageous water almost popcorn too so best to bring your own food if possible or at least your own snacks there are some places for fruit and veges but really expensive one tip is to eat in the downtown disneyland area much better prices and some good quality options ,4,2018-09-27
1919,Still the warm embrace of Uncle Walt is upon his Park,mr toad s wild ride delights me as it always has the teacups at night are a splendid repast the call of the mark twain s whistle invites me on a paddle wheeler trip down the beloved rivers of america i am home ,5,2018-09-27
1920,A must do for all Families,such an amazing place so many things to see highly recommend for all families the staff were super friendly and helpful ,5,2018-09-27
1921,Classic,the happiest place on earth if you re ok with crowds that is even on a quiet weekday you can expect disneyland park to be full of people so it is worth learning how to use fast max pass to get most of your time in the park otherwise it is a great place the park has something for everyone ,5,2018-09-27
1922,Overpriced and Overcrowded,crazy packed even on a tuesday to the point where you could barely move hard to enjoy the experience when you have people walking on your heels or running you over with a stroller food was also crazy expensive and mediocre at best thankfully we did not have to wait in line long for rides but i will say the rides are definitely not worth standing in line for more that minutes only real positive things i found were that there were some really cool souvenirs crazy expensive go figure and that most of the cast members are super helpful and nice special shoutout to the guy at pizza planet that cleaned up my boyfriend s pop spill with a smile and even suggested he go get a refill for free if you have kids it may be worth going but if you re looking to relive your childhood i would stick to a disney movie marathon ,2,2018-09-27
1923,happy tour,if you like disney comic you must go to disneyland park at least once everything there is perfect except the long line if you don t want to spend more than hrs for one ride you could purchase a fast pass by the way if you don t have an annual pass don t drive your own car there unless you want to pay a parking ticket for more than ,5,2018-09-26
1924,No where else like it,forth time being ther in my lifetime lot of changes but still the best was there with my two grandsons and great time i recommend getting the fast pass and handi cap pass if needed take plenty of water and money buying the park jumper tickets will save you time and money staying at disney grand hotel get you instant access to both parks ,5,2018-09-26
1925,Amazing how the park grows,memories from my childhood always include the annual trip to disneyland paper ticket churros glow sticks trinkets replace that with apps and fast passes and food that is much better than an average theme park it s always going to be busy and crowded strollers galore part of that club now but it s all part of the experience ,5,2018-09-26
1926,Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party 2018,what a fun time at disneyland they really know how to put on a good party for all ages you must have a special event ticket from midnight or pm on some dates starting in september thru halloween the parade is awesome and park decorated for halloween some cast members themed costmed n makeup too do wear costumes it adds to the fun see disney rules they even have lots of trick n treat trails which includes healthy snacks all free with your ticket our family dressed as alice in wonderland characters most families and couples or groups had a theme many wonderfully clever costumes even some were lighted we brought our own glow necklaces and bracelets to add when darkness came you are allowed into park at pm then pm park closes and at pm till closing its just for party guests which are limited to a certain of tickets photo stops with characters you rarely see all year at the park california adventure stays open to everyone check out youtube videos to get flavor of the event at disneyland which is also held at wdw florida disney world has a little different event on a larger scale overall great disney esq style fun with a touch of scary we plan on returning again next year ,5,2018-09-26
1927,Great Park Woderful Exsperiance!,make fantastic memories with family and friends there s nowhere else like it in the world we will definitely be returning soon ,5,2018-09-25
1928,Fun for first timer,took my kids to disneyland it s something you have to do at least once in your lifetime my thoughts are i wouldn t be in a hurry to go back every year rides were good line up was awfully long food isn t cheap which you would expect the characters and design were nice there is a trick to get more rides faster go on rides that allow single riders you get rides within mins sometimes faster only downside is you won t be able to ride with your group my kids are and and they were fine with doing this we go in so many rides in day we rode the space mountain times splash mountain another times atsro blasters times and a few other rides there aren t many rides that allow single riders for food we did walk out of the park there s a buffet place i think it was around for adults and for kids my kids don t really care for the disney characters or fireworks so next year i will be taking my kids to another park that s nearby hope this review was helpful ,4,2018-09-25
1929,great place :) but you need to plan accordingly,wow what an experience it is recommended however that you download the disneyland app and plan accordingly due to long ride waiting times overall staff are friendly and do not complain about the crowds it is obviously expected at such a place,5,2018-09-25
1930,Disneyland,cleanest theme park you ve ever been to my advice would to buy your tickets the day before or way before you decide to visit because you don t want to waste time in line grab fast passes so you don t miss out on riding all of your favorite rides that will have long lines time your day right if you want to eat at the returant inside where pirates of the caribbean is make reservations days in advance don t forget to collect your picture cards memories are important suvenoirs can be fairly reasonable depending on what type you want plan your time here wisely so you don t miss out ,5,2018-09-25
1931,Magical!,first visit to this park slightly smaller than the florida operation but magical in its own way found that it was an expensive place to visit everything was more expensive than other parts of usa visited ,5,2018-09-25
1932,September is a great time to go.,expected to have you wait in long lines but not this trip got there early and hit the big rides first then used fast pass in the afternoon to reduce waiting time on the rest we wanted to do we even did some rides twice ,5,2018-09-24
1933,Here is the painful truth about Disneyland,this is a hard review for me to write since i have been to disneyland countless times over the years with my daughter who is now i have a lot of respect and admiration for the creators artists and innovators of disney movies and attractions these men and women are truly inspiring walt would be proud who i don t have a lot of respect for are the greedy corporate shills that have taken walt s vision for disneyland and tossed it out the window in the name of profit maximization it s pretty ridiculous and last weekend s trip to disneyland will be my last here are a few cold hard truths about disneyland way too crowded all day everyday there is no off season ridiculously long waits for rides because it is too crowded fast pass system inefficient because it is too crowded obscenely expensive everything all goods made in china cheap quality terrible food minimal healthy choices stupid expensive terrible value for the amount of spent you pay to stand in line people are herded around like human cattle it s disheartening to watch there are lines for everything and i mean everything overall i can t imagine why any would want to drop hundreds and even thousands of to essentially stand in line all day for a few minutes of fun it just doesn t seem worth it the only ones benefiting from this system are the suits that is it ,1,2018-09-24
1934,Moves people better through lines than Calfornia Adventure,while ther were still long lines fast pass was more effective short wait times with fast pass while renovations going on most rides were operational ,4,2018-09-24
1935,Disney 2018,disney is amazing as always probably my th time visiting and it never disappoints after moving away from anaheim in the s we try to visit about every years or so a bit shocked at the prices for tickets and within the park so visiting more often is not always possible but still an amazing place for memories of recent and long ago,5,2018-09-24
1936,Terrible!,i will never visit disneyland again to start off i waited in line for minutes behind people to buy a ticket once getting to the window i had a ticket person ask me stupid question after stupid question for minutes before telling me i had to go to a different window once i got to the other window they tried to also tell me to go to another window hr later i finally purchased the ticket the park was supposed to be limited on people for mickeys halloween party and the place was packed with people it was almost impossible to walk through i went on pirates of the caribbean and the haunted mansion rides with my family and both rides were stalled and backed up after all of that and spending k between snacks shops and tickets one of their awesome cast members dripping with sarcasm used profanity with me so thank you i ll find a better place to go for halloween next year universal studios here i come at least they know how to treat guests disney you have disgusted me and this is not the st time ,1,2018-09-24
1937,Every Kid Deserves a Disney Trip,our group of recently returned from a night day stay we have children so planning was very important my and year old hadn t been there and my teenagers were young on our last trip so we had a wide range of requests to accommodate tip have a plan ahead but don t be so stuck on it that you lose your mind when things go off the plan because they will we met as a family before to research attractions and made a list by person of the must do attractions we made sure to get those ones done early at park open when wait times were more reasonable get fastpass or maxpass so you can book ride times for the in demand ones tip buy water drinks snacks ahead of time we picked up bottled waters at walgreens for the little savings can add up over your trip and saves on another line tip extra shoes rotate your shoes each day and in case they get wet on splash mountain grizzly river run they will over days at the park we walked nearly km miles and our feet were very sore tip i would do days at the parks next time this would give less pressure to do everything in the park and allow more time to shop relax or just go back to the hotel more to swim nap there is a tremendous amount of pressure to see and do everything and i ve seen many child and adult temper tantrums when things get missed tip save some money for your kids ahead of time and load on a disney gift card for them to use throughout the park great way to budget souvenirs and also easier than cash credit tip rides will break on our trip at various times there were breakdowns at various times if they escort you off the ride or have you leave sorry you re out of luck for that time but if they don t do that wait around and our experiences have been that they often come back on within minutes and you ll get way ahead of lines this has worked for before on radiator springs racers indiana jones and more tip see at least a parade and fireworks while there they are amazing and worth the crowds to see at least once tip when fireworks parades are on ride times do go down a bit and you can often get on quicker to high demand attractions tip know your family ours are pretty good walkers but they have their limits we had to split off a few times to have some members go back to hotels and others stayed at park tip food can be pricey but portions are large you can easily split meals we liked having a hotel with free breakfast buffet so that one meal a day was covered in our costs disneyland can be a pretty overwhelming experience especially if it s your first time staff there is world class and they are there to help so ask speak to your family ahead of time about waiting in lines and spend some time ahead getting to know their habits better to make the most of trip this can be a truly magical lifetime experience if you plan ahead lastly this trip i took the time to look around and really appreciated the fact that this is one of the only places where you can see people of all cultures laughing and smiling together all sharing in the magic of this land ,5,2018-09-24
1938,Go early and go for it!,after a few days at disney i ve learnt that it s best if you go early get a fast pass and go straight to your favourite ride to guarantee a time to get on that ride it beats lining up for a long time for your most desired ride the queues obviously can get long but at disneyland they ve figured out ways to make sure you don t feel as though you re never moving they ve got this aspect of amusement parks figured out there are rides for everyone we have loved our time here and will need to return once the star wars world opens up ,5,2018-09-24
1939,One day - plenty of fun - still worth it,we were all a bit concerned about being there during the school holidays and thought we wouldn t manage to enjoy much of the park on a one day trip we were pleasantly surprised that we did t have to wait much longer than minutes for most of the best rides we didn t miss too much at all the pixar parade was great micky mouse smelled bad though ,5,2018-09-24
1940,Better than expected!,i was not excited to take my family of to disneyland i knew it was going to cost a small fortune surprise surprise i loved it it was totally worth the money not that we will be going every year but it was awesome ,5,2018-09-23
1941,Get your mouse ears on!,we love disneyland the original park has a special kind of magic to it that makes it worth visiting even if you re been to the rest the park can get busy and chaotic but we found that with careful planning we have always had a wonderful time even in on the busiest days pack your patience and let yourself be a kid again ,5,2018-09-23
1942,Not as magical as I expected,my daughter has been talking about nothing but disneyland for months and with the weather in florida i ended up going to the location in california the place is huge we accidentally entered into the wrong park but they quickly were able to change our our tickets and walk us to the right park so the staff is wonderful it was very hot as aspected so wish that they offered a little more shade while waiting in the very long lines we had a great time and the prices for food and beverage weren t as all as high as i thought they would be so that was nice i also didn t know you were allowed to bring in your own food so i will remember that for next time the only downs for me was first the wait times for each ride imagine waiting minutes plus in line with a year old in the blazing fun not fun at all lol so we mostly stuck to the smaller less crowded rides would ve been nice to have been able to get on some of the more popular rides though the second thing was the characters i thought we would ve came across way more characters and when we did it was like an all out war rushing trying to get to them and take a picture but we overall enjoyed ourselves ,3,2018-09-23
1943,"Dizzyland - rides, rides, and more rides",it was still great fun particularly for the kids in spite of the long lines missed directions to the attractions and tiring walk ,5,2018-09-22
1944,Disappointed,we haven t been to disneyland in over years the last time was in the summer and it was stupidily over crowded so we vowed never to go again during summer older now and retired no children to bring along we picked september as our research told us that it was the best time to come kids are back at school and it s before any major holiday well we were quite disappointed as it was very crowded there must be a lot of home schooled kids as the park was filled with school aged children that i would expect to be in school we had days at disneyland one early admission day that was useless the only ride open early was space mountain other than fantasyland all other lands weren t open as retirees i did not want to spend my early hour in fantasy land prior trips to disney gave us many options to go on many of the popular rides fastpass was not very helpful before noon if you got a fastpass you were looking at returning around the supper hour what i understand is that disney is not managing their crowd control i thought it was bad years ago in the summer months after experiencing the crowds in what is supposedly their slowest month heaven help anyone that goes during summertime ,2,2018-09-22
1945,A fun day out,my husband and i visited disneyland park because well it s disneyland knowing that it s predominantly a family kids attraction we were prepared to visit for an hour or two have a look around and go we enjoyed our day and stayed longer than we thought we would we watched the parade which was well organised and had some impressive performers acrobats and actors the parade included floats from some of the latest disney films and although it was advertised this way i still would love to have also seen the traditional disney characters like mickey minnie goofy and donald duck in the parade we did see mickey earlier in the day though so didn t miss out overall it was an enjoyable day and i d highly recommend it to others ,5,2018-09-22
1946,Funnest everer,greatest place in the world for kids can get really hot in the summer so get prepared for it especially with the kids ,5,2018-09-22
1947,It's Disneyland,it is disneyland it is wonderful it is overcrowded it is expensive but overall a fun time the disney magic is alive and well ,5,2018-09-21
1948,Not just for kids,this was our first trip to disneyland and will make sure to go again we had the best time and even though we are adults we enjoyed every ride and interaction with the disney characters best days to go are during the weekdays and after summer break lines were never longer than minutes which was amazing and the fast pass is a must for later in the days and weekends everyone can be a kid at heart here ,5,2018-09-21
1949,Kiwi in Los Angeles,we where lucky enough to come los angeles for a family holiday disneyland was the focus as the dad i not keen on queueing crowds and noise so as you can imagine i was not as excited as the rest of the family disneyland is awesome we can at a great time of year cast members call it a ghost town as a kiwi i found the food to be a good price as i m used to high priced food back home the crowds where fine you really have to buy a fast past by far the best money we spent the cast members staff where out standing the place was spotless i watched rubbish and it would only be on the ground for a matter of minutes before being pick up we went for four days two at disneyland and two at disney adventures this was great as we felt we saw most of what both had to offer ages of my kids and if you come hope you have as much fun as we did cheers kiwi in los angeles,5,2018-09-21
1950,Magical,it never fails to deliver a magical experience however it is just about to the point where it is overpricing everything you purchase for example a small coke is all over the park and it cost the two of us for a three day pass ridiculous ,4,2018-09-21
1951,50th Bday Celebration,we spent days and enjoyed so many rides and a fun parade too ate at a different food venue every meal definitely recommend the pumpkin beignets the skewers are awesome and filling if you go during the halloween season make sure to check the daily schedule for early closing ,5,2018-09-20
1952,Disneyland - Dr. Aron Kondasinghe Sudath,this place is unreal you ve got to see to believe it loads of fun awesome joint for families with kids and for all fun lovers highly recommend it go go go enjoy dr aron kondasinghe sudath,5,2018-09-20
1953,"Happiest time, first solo international trip: June 2015",the first stop of my solo trip to usa was to no other than disneyland it was fantastic the first ride was big thunder mountain railroad multiple turns on star tours splash mountain snow white scary adventures storybook land canal boats roger rabbits car toon spin pirates of the caribbean the best time i found was after the afternoon street parade pinocchio s daring journey dumbo the flying elephant i guess the only downside peter pan was closed for refurbishment haunted mansion was broken and i regret not doing the tower of terror before it was converted to guardians of the galaxy even though the wind affected the night time fireworks the first night was glad that they went ahead the second night decided to see the fireworks over the world of color fantasmic was great paint the night parade was great to see even though there a float had a slight breakdown it was good to see mickey did not stop his routine one day was spent in disneyland the second day was split between california adventure and disneyland kinda wish i had a third full day to spend to do just a few things i didn t get a chance to do,5,2018-09-20
1954,Fun place,disneyland is a great place to visit be mindful that sometimes rides are shut down for maintenance it lists which rides are down on the website and disney app pixar play parade has been extended until there are fireworks and fantasmic to see at night there are shows and music groups to see in the parks i am an annual passholder and am in the park at least once a week right now during halloween time space mountain has been turned into ghost galaxy you can meet some characters from star wars over in tomorrowland as well enough things to do to keep the entire family having fun ,5,2018-09-20
1955,Amazing !!! Worth every penny !!,honestly it s everything you would want in a day out the most magical place food is instaworthy so cute very tasty very expensive i loved the candy corn candy floss and the churros water and drinks are sooooo overpriced take your own the toy selection is awsome minnie ears are the one for disney and the selection is unreal they vary in each land download the disney app we literally made all the character appearances chewbacca was awsome you are thoroughly checked on the way in i m a safety girl so i was pleased about that so much variety for food literally if you fancy it they have it for the love of god be nice to the food people they stand there in the heat dealing with your food and they are so lovely staff are so child friendly lovely absolutely full of tips park short cuts point you in the direction of characters and helpful seriously though make sure your child has basic manners towards them it would be fantastic as listening to that awfulness made me want to tell your children off queues are long get the fast passes some areas are not shaded and it s hot the water fountains are everywhere stay hydrated biggest negative prams they are everywhere blocking everything mission to collect after rides causing queues and blockages on and off the rides i have young children but seriously just take breaks in each land on the way round there is so much to see thinking about going seriously go it s amazing we loved it and will be back ,5,2018-09-20
1956,Magic is GONE forever,big disney fan my whole life i ve been on multiple trips to disneyland disney world and disneyland in paris throughout my life i loved them all our last trip to disneyland september was a complete nightmare we picked one of the lowest seasons of the year knowing that some rides and attractions would be closed it was worth it for us because we thought we would be avoiding big crowds instead we found many many rides closed and the biggest crowds we have ever seen there incredibly hard to walk around and get anywhere long lines at all the rides families stressed out and rushing all over the park horrible horrible atmosphere the magic is completely gone you can t even appreciate the beauty of the park because people are in the way people are everywhere if anyone remembers the magic and the music and simply strolling around and enjoying everything in sight during low season that is gone forever all we found were stressed out moms sweating and pulling their kids all over the park racing to get to rides before everyone else did if you don t rush you re doomed remember when you would run into characters and actually be able to spend some time with them that does not happen anymore if you want to spend seconds with minnie stand in line for at least min if you re lucky you ll get to her normally you won t and have to wait some more for the next character if you want to say hi to captain america or spiderman or black panther be prepared to wait in line for min or longer this is low season people i can t even imagine the park being fuller than it was it seemed impossible to us that more people could fit but when we went crowd levels were at cast members are no longer kind and warm they are all completely stressed out and rude and even mean no wonder their job of keeping things together is very hard horrible horrible and very disappointing experience for my whole family i had spent years telling my kids all about the magic of disneyland and none of it is left if disney doesn t limit crowds somehow i don t think we ll ever be going back the park is beautiful the rides are great the crowds are the problem they create the stressful competitive rude atmosphere that makes everything feel like a big fat race ,1,2018-09-20
1957,Disneymoon,we spent one day at disneyland at the start of our honeymoon it was our first time in disney california but we have visited orlando twice previously it s easy to try to compare the parks but we did find them to be very different which was nice disneyland felt more relaxed than the magic kingdom and even though there are same branded rides the actual ride experience was generally very different we bought the new maxpass with our ticket which we thought was excellent value it s a really beautiful park and we d love to go back ,5,2018-09-20
1958,Crowded and Expensive,over the years disneyland has gotten really expensive for what you get out of your money i ve been multiple times in different months and on different days but it is always crowded if you re coming from out of town you ll need at least two days just for disneyland or for disneyland and disney california adventure definitely try to get fast passes because otherwise you re in line forever the food is also very expensive for what it is ,3,2018-09-20
1959,Great park - need 2 days to do everything,we bought a park hopper ticket for day considering the day we travelled was classed as an off peak however it was still incredibly busy lots of queues but the fast track system worked well if you booked immediately after using one if using the app i would recommend purchasing the photo pass if your buying a park hopper as it only works out more and you can get downloads of all the photos you have professionally taken people say you can do all attractions in day but i would recommend having as we didn t get to do all the rides and sadly the incredicoaster was closed all day ,4,2018-09-20
1960,"Hot, crowded, inefficient and bad food",perhaps disneyland has been oversold as a paradise perhaps i m a grumpy old codger perhaps it would have been more fun if i had taken children and i could have watched them be happy it was unpleasantly hot it was unpleasantly crowded the lines were long two of the five rides i took broke down and we had to walk out the last ride i took space mountain was an exercise in keeping my dinner inside of me that would have been easier to do had the food at disneyland been something besides low quality marginally edible and high priced so i left earlier than planned and thus ended up happy save your money ,2,2018-09-20
1961,Indeed where dreams come true!,other amusement parks must have risen but nothing beats the spirit of disneyland i ve been going to this amusement park since the s and i still do every time i visit la the place continuously updates itself with rides and various forms of entertainment of course the classical characters are always around ready to welcome you entertain you and have themselves photographed by you the street parades are some of the things i always look forward to every time i visit this place the queues to the rides may sometimes get long but you have the option to avail of a fast track pass i suggest that you avoid the weekends and holidays when the park really gets jam packed also try to be there early so as to enjoy as many rides and shows as possible and stay until the grand finale of the fireworks display that s when you ll realize that dreams indeed come true at disneyland d,5,2018-09-20
1962,Magical,was born in florida and have always gone to walt disney world have also been an annual passholder for years disneyland still has the magic that wdw has lost over the years it was just wonderful better versions of rides better food also options for vegans and vegetarians rekindled my love of disney ,5,2018-09-20
1963,Great vacations! Disney photographers make great memories!,we had a great time in disneyland we went as a family vacations and we all are so different good to know that now you can purchase fast passes and enjoy more attractions also the photos are taken by profesional photographers which makes them great and all of this for a few dollars its totally worth ,5,2018-09-18
1964,Family,been twice now loved both visits shows are great and make sure you watch the parades they are very well done we also had breakfast with minnie inside the park which is great and a lot easier to get photos and autographs well worth the money the first visit we did goofeys kitchen that was great too minnie s was booked out when i rang so we walked up early as soon as the park opened and got in ,5,2018-09-18
1965,Not great at all,maxipass a total disappointment we got just photos never got the photo that was shot by photographer and fastline tickets you can easily get in other way inside the park toontown closes at pm after many years there was not one new attraction matterhorn is closed my family who were for the first time in this disneyland were not so excited nothing really special ,3,2018-09-18
1966,AMAZING of course!,what can you expect from the happiest place on earth disneyland park is a fantastic place for any age we visit every year and it is always a refresh to our work fill lives get to the park early to enjoy shorter lines on your favorite or must see rides like indiana jones maxpass makes life so much easier and a better experience with maxpass we could get fastpass from our phone avoiding the booths and it includes digital copies of professional photos around the park even without maxpass be sure to load the disneyland app for wait time listing on an interactive map from the app you can also book restaurant reservations ,5,2018-09-18
1967,Absolutely Glorious Place,we were away for days and we spent of those days at disneyland we had a fantastic time here there is so much to see and do from rides to shows it was great the fire works display is well worth staying around to watch ,5,2018-09-18
1968,"Must see, but not great for rides.",if you love rides not the best but remember this is an old park detail of park cleanliness is fantastic make sure you get a fast pass you can get this for free every hrs or after you have used one would be much cheaper if there s a few of you going to leave park just use your ticket to re enter go across the road where theses lots of different places to eat make sure you stay for the fireworks if they are on but you need to get a good spot early looking at castle from front ,5,2018-09-17
1969,Avoid the weekends,love the parks but hate the weekends at disneyland la is such a large area and many people have season passes making saturday and sundays very crowded the best time to ride rides and wonder are weekdays before lunch we often can ride rides between park open and noon pm even with preschoolers with us ,5,2018-09-17
1970,First time at Disneyland and First theme park visit outside of Australia,so i m a mid s guy who has spent nearly all his life in the country he was born australia sure i ve been to new zealand and as far away as hawaii but in our family decided it was time to go fully state side with a young family we couldn t not stop over at disneyland it was the first theme park i ve been to outside of australia and let me say i was blown away we all were australian theme parks have nothing on disneyland the thematic s of all the attractions and parks themselves make our local theme parks which i ve spent a lot of time at look like backyard side shows the happiest place on earth isn t far from the truth i can t say i ve had a more fun days in my life from arriving at am and staying on until after midnight on of the days we were there we definitely packed in everything we could construction was happening when we were there so that was a bit of a shame we didn t get to see the iconic disney parades but we were happy to see world of color and the final showings of fantasmic a definite stop over for anyone visiting that part of california highly recommended and plan a minimum days ,5,2018-09-17
1971,Leave Disneyland!,disney goes above and beyond with the attention to detail amazing customer service and non stop fun we take our family at least times a year and there is fun for all ages having kids from there is something for everyone which can be hard at other theme parks the characters take their time and make the kids feel special the food is good entertainment besides just rides amazing fireworks it is worth every penny ,5,2018-09-17
1972,Nice park for kids and families,been here for a day we went to the disneyland park ticket is for a couple and a fast past is dollar more download the app it s very helpful to know where you are and which way to go the park is nice it s especially for kids for older people go to the flags you can stay in a motel next to the park which is minte walk from the park so we came in the morning and their were no people at noon we rest in the hotel and come back in the evening but then we found out that there are a lot of people ,4,2018-09-17
1973,Great Visit for My Daughter's First Trip to A Disney Park.,let me say that we had fun at the disneyland parks in california my daughter absolutely loved it my wife and i only felt so so about it the location is beauand the park is immaculate the security lines could use improvements hour plus waits were not uncommon for us to get inside the parks also one security guard would do things different than another if there is one thing i hate with corporate operations it is inconsistency the food at the quick service restaurants i could have done without it was mostly so so and lacked variety the sit down restaurants were all phenomenal not a single bad choice or lack of variety the service at the sit down restaurants was even better than the food we thoroughly enjoyed everyone the staff at the character meals were also excellent when they found out my daughter was having her first visit they went out of their way to make sure that she got to see every character and that they signed an autograph for her one lady in particular at goofy s kitchen whose name escapes me at the moment went above and beyond for my daughter we also decided to have our daughter turned into a princess for the day at the bibbidi bobbidi boo boutique what a great experience my daughter loved it her dada even allowed the no make up rule to be abandoned she is only the young lady that did her hair and transformed her into a princess was exceptional she was great with children and dealing with parents the young lady made my daughter feel like a princess from the moment she came over and introduced herself to my daughter we did not stay on park as my wife and i do with disney world but did stay with one of the disney guest recommended hotels it was a great choice close to the parks and excellent staff overall it was a good trip it was more for my daughter than my wife and i so mission accomplished there i do not see us going back as my wife and i think the wdw parks are more fun with better food also they have more character meals and meets i do reccomend that everyone who loves disney visit disneyland parks at least once they do house the original parks and are still fun to visit ,3,2018-09-17
1974,Disney Magic,came here during the halloween celebration and it was just a blast main street was decked out entirely in the halloween theming if you re a fan of the nightmare before christmas disneyland is the place to be there were jack and sally items as well as the characters just strolling around taking pictures and boy did they draw a crowd when they came by but my favorite items were the zero the dog plushes that were being the best part was the halloween overlay for the haunted mansion the interior and exterior seemed like it was pulled from the movie it was awesome i wasn t the only one who thought so since the line to go to the ride grew exponentially big within a few hours after disneyland opened the new halloween theming also included new halloween themed food items like the halloween themed churro pumpkin spice churro and a poison apple souvenir cups i spent days here at the park and stayed the entire hours that the park was open and totally had a blast if you re a fan or just curious to come to the park it s totally worth it ,5,2018-09-16
1975,62 years and still love it!!,love the entrance under the train station and the transportation options up and down main street easy travel from one land to another there are still quiet out of the way spots like the wishing well for when the toddlers doze and parents need a short break can t wait for the acre stars wars area to open next year there is something special we enjoy in each land we stay until closing and then enjoy an hour of shopping on main street after the close ,5,2018-09-16

1978,Family Holiday,not what we were expecting too be completely honest very underwhelming we spent days at disneyland and we didn t get that wow factor even our year old son wasn t really that impressed just spent the entire day at universal studios and it was so so so much better ,3,2018-09-15
1979,Happiest Place in the World,there is no place like disneyland in the world beautiful falls decorations and all the colors just beautiful and this is the best time to go the lines weren t so bad and most of the rides were open ,5,2018-09-14
1980,Child’s Dream Come True,my kids always wanted to go to disneyland they re a bit older but they still had a blast i only wish it was a bit cheaper to go to the parks we visited only one park as it cost us over usd for people they have passes but we calculated and it costs cdn we researched it before we went there all in all it s a great experience and we have wonderful memories as a family ,4,2018-09-14
1981,Magical experience,happiest place on earth maybe but also one of the most crowded and expensive places on earth too firstly we visited the park with young children for one day only and that is clearly not enough given the long lines for rides and attractions you have to really have to plan and prioritize what you want to and can possibly do in ten to twelve hours or so although fastpass etc did somewhat help in cutting lines you will still not be able to do everything you may want to in a day but we still managed to do some great rides thrills attractions parades and the grand fireworks at night after the tickets and passes all food snacks drinks including water bottles gift shops everything inside the park is crazy expensive it s great that you can bring in food snacks non alcoholic drinks and water into the park so bring as much as you can water fountains are scattered throughout the park so that should not be a problem the disney staff we encountered were very professional and helpful you are allowed to exit and re enter that park during the day as long you have your printed entry ticket for that day i had lost my ticket but wanted to go out for a few minutes i approached the staff at the exit gate who directed me to a outside ticket counter where i was quickly issued a fresh duplicate ticket after completing some formalities a magical and thoroughly enjoyable day ,5,2018-09-13
1982,4th Visit,this was my fourth trip to disney land we prefer this much over world as it s easier to manage with non teen children the rides are great for adults and children if you get the fast pass system down then you can get everything done in days the paint the night parade second time we ve seen it is amazing as well while there s a lot of great things my only gripes are a outside security act like they re guarding the president and make it very inconvenient defying common sense b food for the most part sucks c we were there on one of the slowest weekends of the year and still could barely walk because of so many people ,5,2018-09-13
1983,"Wonderful day out but busy, busy, busy.",my family love disney and we had a wonderful day here it is magical and make believe and you find yourself thinking it s all real but it is expensive and soooo busy with s of people ,5,2018-09-13
1984,Diappointrd,we ve visited disneyland paris several times and disneyworld numberous times but since moving to los angeles disneyland which you think should be the leader pales in comparison for a start it s a real drag to get there from la in traffic but hardly the parks fault the problems start with the jobsworth attitude and impersonal service and how miserable employees are and the sheer magnitude of people they let into the park this time though really takes the biscuit and we aren t even going for another weeks my older daughter wanted to save and pay for our adopted kids to go for halloween she saved up all summer and we helped her out then my year old broke her leg and will be days away from getting her cast off when we are due to go we imagined that disney would let us change the date as there was still availability but they will not budge they say we need to pay again and donate our existing tickets this will be our last visit to disneyland we will make the effort to go to disney world next year where we know we will have a great experience i might add that we were able to have great wolf lodge allow us to cancel our booking other relatives from the u k who are meeting us there were all able to change their plans but disney is so focused on the bottom line that all they see are the it s a great shame and surely does not honor the great man ,1,2018-09-13
1985,I Love MaxPass,my family adults teen just returned from days at disneyland and we loved using maxpass for fast pass and for photos with a little planning we prioritized which rides we cared about and which had the longest waits and ended up able to ride everything we wanted with little to no wait we also utilized the single rider lines when possible my only regret wearing socks on the water rides wet socks led to blisters awful if we went back i d bring flip flops to wear on water rides and dry my feet well before putting socks and sneakers back on ,5,2018-09-12
1986,Magical,we went to disneyland on a monday and california adventure on a tuesday because of this we didn t see the fireworks but we were ok with that disneyland exceeded my expectations i am glad we attended in the low season as we were nearly able to go on every ride in the park with a standard ticket purchase you are able to use the fast pass machines these were great to use to make sure we got to go on the popular rides and didn t wait long in line allowing us plenty of time to walk between and see all the different worlds we arrived when the park opened at am and stayed until it closed at pm it was a long day but we feel we definitely got our money s worth and there are plenty of nice shady spots in the park to sit and have a rest throughout the day food we packed our own snacks and sandwiches for lunch the food inside the park is a little on the expensive side as you would expect there are are healthy foods for sale which i was pleasantly surprised to see corn on the cob watermelon cut up veggies grapes etc there is also starbucks coffee on site ,5,2018-09-12
1987,Good place for family gatherings.,disneyland is not just for young children my adult children always celebrate here and i love to join them i can be that child that is still in me and have a fun great time the new orleans restaurant is a family favorite make sure you make reservations otherwise you might loose out ,5,2018-09-12
1988,Woooohoooo!,personally i love disney and i ll be coming back because i m amazed of the fantasy and impressed how clean this place is i loved nothing to complain,5,2018-09-12
1989,How can you give it 5 Stars?!?,i really can t see how people have a bad word to say about this park i ve been to the florida and paris disney parks also and still think the california one is the best i m not a crazy disney fan but i love theme parks for the rides yes the rides at disney aren t the biggest but the whole atmosphere there makes you feel like a big kid again the park is spotlessly clean and all the staff super friendly and helpful the theming of the park is amazing you could almost just walk around it all day looking at the scenery without going on the rides the food is also excellent i d definitely recommend downloading the app which has all the menus and pricing information for all of the food and drink outlets in the parks there s food for all budgets and a range of options from grab and eat on the go to a full waiter service sit down and eat a proper meal i d definitely recommend getting the disney max pass for an extra pp firstly you can download all of your rides pictures and any pictures taken by disney photographers for free on it you can also use it to book fast passes on the go instead of having to walk to the terminals near the ride to get them saved on a lot of walking for people complaining about ride times try any theme park in school holidays they re all going to be rammed even the rubbish little parks here in the uk will queue for minutes a ride in school holiday time unlike other parks disney give everyone the chance to get fast passes free of charge with their ticket so if you re organised and a bit savvy with your fast passes you can easily ride most of the rides in a day i visited on christmas day a few years ago which is one of the parks busiest days and we got on nearly everything the queues for the rides are also heavily themed so you have things to look at as you queue which helps pass the time a bit ,5,2018-09-12
1990,Had a blast,had a brilliant time with the family weather was really hot but enjoyable best time to visit when it s not the us school holidays ,5,2018-09-12
1991,Does this really need a review??,disneyland is the best place ever i have been multiple times and am never disappointed sometimes some of the things they change are bothersome but i am too nostalgic never had an unfriendly staff member and do they keep it clean if you don t like crowds and wait times then stay away but if you come expecting it and give yourself enough time days to see and do all that you want you too will love it i hadn t been in awhile due to moving out of state so since then they now have the disneyland app and maxpass which make so many things so much easier reservations pictures fast pass etc i highly recommend doing both and bring a charging pack for your phone ,5,2018-09-10
1992,Happiest Place on Earth with a Max Pass,i get that disney is a business and is there to make money however i feel annoyed by the implementation of the max pass we spend thousands travelling to disney pay the entry fee and they are still after more i understand that universal are the same i feel as though disney has lost some of its shine long long lines and little movement for spontaneity whilst i did love disney i think it will be a long time before i return to disneyland anaheim the app was useful for checking ride times ,4,2018-09-10
1993,Magical Place~ Prices Not So Much,i was only able to go to the park for a short visit bust managed to get onto splash mountain single rider line big thunder railroad and pirates of the caribbean the park was very busy and i had bought a twilight pass which is good from pm until closing i was able to watch fantasmic through a forest of cell cameras in front of me somewhat disrupting my view etc i was also able to see a bit of the pixar fest though i had taken a fall and banged my left knee a bit so left the park just after pm so for about a hour visit pm don t get me wrong i love disneyland but after being a longtime annual pass holder for many years i quit going for a long time and did so due to the annual pass holder price increases and the fact that disneyland really offers no patron appreciation benefits to returning pass holders or seniors in general this hour visit was my st in years i m years old but still love my memories here ,4,2018-09-09
1994,THE BEST EXPERENCE!,my husband and i took our three children on a trip to disneyland last april we stayed at the dolphin and the service there was wonderful in the park there was something for everyone my oldest son is and he was at first afraid that he would be bored but with the roller coasters souvenirs d adventures and food he was soon caught up in the excitement as well and the look on my year old daughter s face when minnie mouse came up to hug her was unforgetable i highly suggest you take your children here ,5,2018-09-08
1995,Great day out,had a fabulous day here things seemed a little less chaotic before lunch and got quite a lot of rides in a little longer line ups later in the day but nothing too bad use the fastpass wisely and make the most of them was a long day but well worth it,5,2018-09-08
1996,Great trip,living on the east coast we are dw lovers and this was our first trip to dl and cda and will not be our last ,5,2018-09-07
1997,"Been here 4 times since 1980s, still wonderful, but has over-commercialised",disneyland was originally all about fun rides with the added bonus of some cartoon characters that was yrs ago now it is all about cartoon movies with all the new rides directly selling the movie franchise eg toy story even some charming original rides being murdered in favour cross selling a movie franchise for example the submarine ride in tomorrowland used to be a wonderful undersea cruise through atlantis leagues under the sea stuff and pirate shipwrecks now it is a very poor showing in favour of finding nemo characters shown on underwater lcd screens nevertheless the magic persists one warning to owners of selfie sticks they are banned security staff will not let you in with one with your car a min tran ride away you will have to throw it away while i understand their thinking it is a poor effort in that nowhere prominent is any sign in tne carpark or entrance warning of this giving you a chance to leave it in your car ,5,2018-09-07
1998,Meh,like much in america nowadays the new rides are loud obnoxious and typical the old school stuff is good but this place has sold out to the almighty dollar lots of crowds and unless you absolutely love disney stuff it has lost its luster ,3,2018-09-07
1999,Awesome,food good rides good disney characters good star wars section is nice could be bigger but characters are all excellent plenty of food and photo opportunities recommend maxpass extra pp day at least one day for rides in the morning and photos in the afternoon get there early grab fastpasses for the busy rides early use the app to be smart about your fastpasses app shows wait until fastpass is available if you use maxpass through the app try and be smart about your picks you can have or different fasspasses active depending on when they come available if you make a mistake cancel the fastpass and do a different one we are from australia and had issues with the app when on roaming try and use wifi or make sure you have good reception and stay in one area when making your fastpass selections so it doesnt time out or mess up on you good luck have fun ,5,2018-09-06
2000,Meh! Saved by the Fantasmic show and fireworks.,never particularly ever wanted to visit disney but being so close we felt we should and kids were in tow first off the downtown disney was pretty disappointing after visiting city walk at universal studios expectations were high downtown is small uninspiring and a lot was shut for renovations we went on a tuesday at the park itself was ok i think i expected more all of it worth it though for the amazing fantasmic and fireworks at the end of the day awesome anyways here s the good and bad good easy to get ticket no lines at on a hot august tuesday paid extra for max pass well worth it fantasmic and fireworks wow long rides some went on for ages pirates of caribbean indiana jones second time as first it broke for a bit when we were on it getting reserved area view from river belle terrace dinner bad mostly old rides some were shut bob sled and haunted house lacking big thrill rides being unable to stand anywhere to watch the parade without being constantly shooed by staff really confusing and irritating so we moved on and didn t see it didn t really see the characters i had expected most disney was from all the other visitors wearing the merch downtown very poor nothing there with the sound of building work ,3,2018-09-06
2001,Perfect. Loved it.,everything is just lovely about this park you can see why families with kids of all ages enjoy it whilst the rides are not too fast n thrilling for the older kids space mountain does the job well enough we ate in the new orleans restaurant and we very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food truly delicious seared tuna salad we spent a day here using fast pass system and retuned in our last day to do the big rides first thing i the morning we also saw the parade which was lots of fun and returned back to the park at pm to see the fireworks well worth the trip you can begin to seethe building of the new star wars section which excites the chaps a lot looking forward to going next year when it opens fingers crossed ,5,2018-09-06
2002,Best day ever,it s the happiest place on earth tit sure lives up to it i had the best day not katich waiting for rides great time of year to visit ,5,2018-09-06
2003,1st visit to Disney Anaheim - MaxPass advice,we visited disneyland park not adventure last week in late august midweek best tip we bought a maxpass for all of us at first i felt that it was a waste of money however once i realised that it worked to help us plan our day better i would definitely recommend it it made light work of the lines i had assumed that it was just a priority access to rides in a separate line with smaller queues running alongside the regular lines it isn t i tried to research it prior to our visit i could t find anywhere that explained it as it truly works so download the disneyland app once you ve arrived in the park the sooner you access activate the maxpass the better you have to reserve your maxpass access to specific rides at given times the earlier you make your first reservation the earlier the system allows you to make your next one after which you are then given timescales in which you can continue to make reservations for rides each time you use a maxpass on a ride check to see how soon you can make a new reservation on a new ride beyond the maxpass i found the app wifi very temperamental and intermittent in the park other features of the app were too messy to spend time on as the wifi wasn t stable this meant that i just concentrated on booking maxpass access to rides instead of linking photos etc wish i d have had more time to work this feature out food outlets were reasonably priced and offered decent food we have children aged and the rides accommodated everyone ,4,2018-09-05
2004,Purely Magical.,we have been to disneyland twice in the last years and are planning for times in years pretty good considering we live in australia the long flight is totally worth it nothing bad to say at all yes there are lines at security yes there are lines to get into the parks yes there are lines to get onto rides and get some food but you are in disneyland enjoy the situation be happy smile look around at the small details eat a churo visit the tiki room we went over during halloween the overlays and decorations are amazing always something new to see or do the halloween party is a must everyone dresses up free candy the staff are always helpful and smiling take your time walking down main st there is more than just shopping there get there early to avoid huge lines stay after the fireworks everyone heads out but the park is still open wear comfortable shoes try to eat outside normal times can t wait to go back ,5,2018-09-05
2005,Waiting for starwsrd,can see spires rising in the distance too many rides closed right now glad they slowed down indiana jones ,4,2018-09-04
2006,Indeed the happiest place in the earth,wonderful place so many entertainment activities for all ages technology is far superior you won t regret going get fastpass if you are using a oneday ticket ,5,2018-09-04
2007,Incredible time at Disney,we went on labor day and was told to be prepared for a very crowded park quite the contrary the crowd was very manageable and we were able to get on all the rides we wanted some more than once the fastpass is worth the extra money great to see so many restaurant options now not just street food or fried fast food we all had so much fun can t wait to come back again parking and and getting into the park was tricky and should be better managed but if you ask they direct you everywhere you need to go looking forward to seeing what it is they are building out now ,5,2018-09-04
2008,It's just corporate greed now.,as said in your own tripadvisor page it s the happiest place on earth well i have to say that this experience was a massive disappointment and when compared with our experience at universal just appalling in this land of magic and dreams we found all the staff to be miserable and unhelpful they just looked so depressed and like they didn t want to be there they didn t make us feel welcome and with me being blind i received no support at all be it getting on or off rides or help with queues in our day we managed just rides yes just rides it was way too overcrowded we knew that in august it would obviously going to be busy and hot but there was no shade whilst waiting for rides and very minimal shade whilst walking around the park in one queue we were in a lady fainted due to the lack of shade and heat many queues were minutes long which doesn t help another issue that made things worse was that the fast track queues had such an impact on everyone more of them were getting pushed along leaving everyone else behind i don t have an issue with people paying the extra to get ahead but disney really need to control numbers here as it significantly penalises others out of the four rides we went on at disney i would say that the space mountain rollercoaster is best and not to be missed that s if you can get on as you would expect the gift shops are pricy as is food and drink although comparing favourably with similar attractions it just seemed to take the mick being charged a further dollar for parking on top of an already pricey dollars for a ticket this was a birthday treat and first visit for my partner who was extremely disappointed i love disney florida but i just cannot recommend disneyland california at all and i am sure walt disney would be mortified if he could see his creation today ,1,2018-09-04
2009,Disneyland is a Favorite with Me and My Teens,we visited disneyland over labor day weekend so we expected it to be crowded sadly we were not disappointed it was super crowded with clueless people who literally stop right in the middle of the main walkways to either talk with someone else or to simply stare into space that got frustrating by the end of our days at the parks i was literally done with people that said if you know how to do disney you can avoid a lot of the huge lines and maximize the fun not only did i use the maxpass system but i also used ridemax to help plan our day both options cost extra but they are worth their weight in gold with all the rides we were able to ride we calculated that we spent about per ride not bad a couple times we got to a ride to use our fastpass only to be told that the ride was down the friendly cast members changed our fastpass to a multiride pass meaning that we didn t lose the fastpass but could now use it on any ride the entire day it was great some people who reviewed disney stated that the maxpass system isn t worth it because you can have only one pass at a time not true i had fastpasses at one time and it was pretty awesome when we were between fastpass rides we simply went on the smaller rides that didn t have long lines or we had a meal or we literally took a short nap on the sidewalk all in all we used our time wisely and rode a lot of rides while not all cast members were super friendly if i engaged them in conversation they loosened up a bit they are all doing a job and also have to deal with cranky kids and entitled parents so i cut them some slack even with the crowds my girls and i will be back we enjoyed riding rides we normally don t ride teacups nemo etc and love big thunder indiana jones and space mtn ,4,2018-09-04
2010,great time,i went there with my family and had a great time we were in town to attend a wedding and decided to take in disney i have not been here since the s and i liked it as much as i have back then i got to give a special thanks to two of their emplyees who went above and behond their duties but getting my aunt who needed a hearing aide battery one from their personal battires one of the emplyees asked the other if she can spare one we spent from about pm to pm in the park and were exsusted when we got back to hotel,5,2018-09-04
2011,MAGICAL,what can i say disney world say everything don t miss it we live just once an unforgettable experience,5,2018-09-04
2012,Firework show was awesome!,my second time around it was just as great as my first experience here me and my girlfriend had a lot of fun here the fireworks show at night time was awesome ,5,2018-09-04
2013,It was Okay,disneyland hasn t change much it been years ago but was nice to visit again i love just spend time with family but park is okay need improvement ,3,2018-09-04
2014,I finally went to Disneyland!,i ve been to disney world many times but had never been to disneyland and i was so excited to go i was to be honest shocked at how teeny the castle was compared to cinderella s castle but it was still of course beautiful i thought it was neat how some of the rides which i d gone on so many times in orlando were a little bit different here it made them feel brand new ,5,2018-09-04
2015,Not the place it was the Walt was alive,it is still a great family fun atmosphere but the special magic moment that it use to be finding rides shut down long lines and average expensive food choices still a great place to visit just not over the top ,3,2018-09-04
2016,Disneyland - First Visit,my family and i have been to disneyworld more times than i can count so it was very exciting for us to take our first trip to disneyland many differences between the two parks but i truly enjoyed seeing the park that walt built there are rides for people of all ages and many if not all were handicapped accessible when we visited the lines were not too long and we used fast passes as much as we could we purchased a day pass one for disneyland and one for california adventure as a first time visitor more direction from the cast members would have been beneficial on where to go in getting into the park plan on an all day visit as there is so much to do with rides shows fireworks parades and eating ,4,2018-09-03
2017,Truly the Happiest Place on Earth!!,the first time i ever went to disneyland was the day it first opened to the public way back in the s i loved it then and i have always loved it i could never understand my first girlfriend when i suggested going there probably the fourth or fifth time when she said it s boring i think at that moment i decided to drop her over the years i ve gone back and back again had yearly passes and seen so many things change almost always for the better back then i lived around a half hour from the place and if i did now i d go back there anytime for sheer fun fantasy music and beauty you just can t beat it and now with california adventures right across the street it s even more fun if you ever have a chance to go here go and just have the best most fantasmagorical experience of your life ,5,2018-09-03
2018,Had a great time,we got a day park day pass with maxpass to use fastpass which saved us time easier to order online as there are lineups at kiosks some hotels also sell for same price for park day we found it to better than the park hopper since there is a lot to cover in each of the parks we stayed at a hotel outside the parks but near a disney parking lot which is free to hop on the shuttles that take you straight to the entrance weather was great warm and sunny all the time so make sure you take a refillable water bottle and snacks fruits security was ok with that fast food at some restaurants inside were priced moderately but the healthier options were too pricey ,4,2018-09-03
2019,Just fantastic,i visited disneyland from ireland in july i had mixed views on disney i don t like queueing excessive heat or roller coasters but it was fantastic we stayed in the disneyland hotel and had early access in the morning between that and the fast pass system it was very easy to access a lot of attractions with minimal queueing when it got hot we could go back to the hotel and have a swim we all loved it we visited both parks in anaheim and enjoyed both but perhaps liked california adventure park a little better the rides are all superb it is great fun for all the family and even in the heat and it was degrees on one of the days we were there they look after their visitors very well go if you can ,5,2018-09-03
2020,Magical fun,we purchased a pay for days get day park hopper ticket a promo running in oz a couple of months before we left for usa this worked out to be brilliant as changed vouchers for tickets night before we actually went in so saved lots of wasted time in morn and could walk straight through ticket gates take photo id on first day as they take a picture of you for security purposes park hopper tickets worth getting use fast passes for any ride you can saves alot of time yes food and drink is dearer but what else can we expect in theme parks patience is a virtue if you happen to be in a long line for a ride best time to visit is out of school holidays and weekdays seem to be a little better as well as lines definitely aren t as long cars ride in adventure disney always has long line so definitely get fast pass early take advantage of magic morning at disneyland if you have one as you can get in at am and enjoy a couple of the worlds rides last but not least we found disney staff are so polite and friendly from security at front to gate staff and everyone inside a credit to the place it truly is the happiest place on earth enjoy ,5,2018-09-03
2021,Friends deal!,i was able to go to disneyland with my annual passholder friend for two days friday august was a pretty good day with limited crowds saturday the st was way more crowded max pass is amazing and i love it just make sure that if you re going to go eat at different places in the park you now have to make reservations for a lot of the places also fantasmic now is fast pass so make sure you get your fast pass for either the pm or show they do not except walkins anymore because it is so crowded ,5,2018-09-03
2022,Extremely busy,have been a few times before and love disney am such a big fan it was just so busy this time lines were over an hour wait fast pass needs to be reduced to one very hour not every two that way you could do all rides especially if you come all the way from australia but still love it and will return security is over the top takes a very long time and you have to stand in the heat for ages to clear security before lining up again to get into the park ,4,2018-09-03
2023,Exceeded expectations,this was my first time at disneyland and it did not let down staff is so friendly and helpful the prices are high but you see that with every amusement park you truly feel like a little kid as soon as you walk in the gates the park is huge i recommend visiting at least two days to fit it all in three if getting the park hopper pass and going to disney california adventure also ,5,2018-09-02
2024,Disney Magic,first visit and really loved this park we had extra magic mornings so get to go on most rides before the park opened we also used max pass so could book fast passes really quickly we managed to do most rides apart from peter pan as the queue was always an hour plus even at extra magic morning all the cast members were lovely and helpful and the park and toilets clean i was disappointed in the food we ate at blue bayou which was disappointing and all the other sit down restaurants needed reservations or had long waits we ate twice at bengal bbq which was great and cafe orleans do the monte cristo sandwich which is two sandwiches and enough for two one portion of the frites will also feed two easily beignets at the mint julip cafe were lovely and hot all the food and drink was very very expensive we took snacks and bottled drinks in after the first day to keep costs down we got to meet lots of characters throughout the park but due to the heat they were not out for long so we had to be quick we didn t watch any parades as people were sitting down an hour before they start and we didn t want to waste ride times ,4,2018-09-02
2025,Family Trip 2018,disneyland never fails to impress me we went years ago and this year was even better the fantasmic show is unforgettable so don t miss it the staff is always doing their best to accommodate families they go above and beyond ,5,2018-09-02
2026,Disastrous lines!!!!,what a shame plan for a vacation and spent one hour just in line to get into the park no staff giving directions or info about lines that went all the way out to the street we re talking about blocks but if you do not have anything with you and they mean nothing small bag not even a large wallet then you go to a smaller line i have never seen such lines anywhere park attractions or stadiums getting cheap on security guess they do not want to spend money on staff save yourself from waisting your morning never come early on busy days ,2,2018-09-02
2027,Vacation,so much to see and do for our family of seven three days turned out to be the perfect amount all the disney staff were so friendly and helpful a bit expensive for entry and food inside for a family of six we made memories our family will treasure forever ,5,2018-09-02
2028,Magical time,we had a blast buying the fast pass deal is the way to go use the app to sign in we barely waited to get on rides all day we ve been to the florida one so many times and had to check this one out only downfall is i don t understand how people from out of town make a vacation out of it due to the prices a one day park hopper pass with fast pass added for people was around that s insane probably be a long time before we come back but for a one time deal it was magical ,5,2018-09-02
2029,Had a blast!,the longest we waited in line for any ride was minutes buzz lightyear is a favorite and we walked right on once matterhorn was closed the fireworks were great had a fantastic chicken strawberry spinach salad ,5,2018-09-01
2030,Disney,not disneyworld but still great two days will cover both parks if not too busy we had two kids aged and if you can afford it definitely go to disneyworld instead far far far more there but then that s expected we threw this day out into our first visit to california and its a huge road trip i wanted to see the original very pleased i did ,5,2018-09-01
2031,Disney...,this park is great compared to all other theme parks but it s still my least favorite disney park in the states ,3,2018-09-01
2032,"Pixar Fest, Girls Trip and Disney Magic",this was a special girls trip with my bestie to celebrate her birthday i hadn t been to visit in years and it felt so good to be back we stopped in city hall to talk about disability accommodations i have a hard time standing on my feet for long periods of time and walking a lot i knew from previous visits that disneyland has accommodations for disabled and special needs kids for certain rides you use a special entrance usually the exit and a cast member works you into the regular line or gives you a time to return unfortunately i was met with a cast member that didn t embody the disney way and refused to help me i don t look disabled which shouldn t matter anyway after being refused we decided to hit the park anyway i ended up renting a scooter at the disneyland hotel totally worth it the park wasn t super crowded considering it was mid august it was super hot though and rather smokey due to the fires we had day passes with park hopper and max pass the max pass gets you unlimited pics from the disneyland photographers that was totally worth the cost you download the app and get your qr code that the photographer scans after taking your pictures i screenshot the code so i could easily find it and didn t have to open the app every time the app also gave us the wait times for rides and we were able to make some plans my friend is gluten free and while there are tons of gluten free options in the park the app doesn t show those options on the menu what you need to do is ask at each restaurant when ordering and then they let you know what you can order the options were super yummy and never repeated which was fantastic they really are progressive when it comes to options my only sadness many of the cast members were cranky and it was very un disney like it was such a fantastic trip ,5,2018-09-01
2033,Walt Disney World Fan Visits for 1st Time!,i ve been visiting walt disney world in florida since i was a baby so this visit meant so much to me to get to visit disneyland for the first time i found the crowds a little bigger overall to be expected but the thrill was the same tips go earlier than opening time to get in line this line is worth it so that you can be in the park before the crowds do the most popular rides first my favourites were pirates of the caribbean splash mountain haunted mansion and space mountain stay on site we decided to stay at a campground because we were towing a trailer and drive to disney and park on site this wasn t a great idea because they hold cars at the gate to the parking garage until a certain time other people taking buses or walking from an on site hotel got into the parks earlier pre book dining reservations if it s a busy time of year and pre book your fast passes as early as you can you don t want to miss out on those incredible rides and dining experiences bring water and sunscreen but spend a little on snacks it s part of the experience get your fast passes for evening events early in the day when you get to the park watch out for these dispensers as they can be easy to miss don t try and do two parks in one day it s just too much to do and you ll be exhausted and disappointed if you leave after only one day in fact go for days if you can have fun ,5,2018-09-01
2034,Fantastic place,we visited this park after or so years visiting walt disney world in florida it was nice to visit the original all be it a lot smaller and very congested really worth visiting if you re a disney fan ,5,2018-09-01
2035,Best family vacation ever,we came back because we loved it here so much we spent had a days park a day ticket and it was the greatest decision ever the downside was actually the crowd it was too crowded at that time luckily we purchased our max passes with extra per person use your best shoes because you ll need it ,5,2018-09-01
2036,Loved it!!,what an amazing place i love going to everything disney we went around thanksgiving and it was very busy ,5,2018-09-01
2037,Nothing compares :),disneyland is a special place that never fails to disappoint everytime i visit this place i enter a whole never world and it amazes me it is so accomodating offering something for everyone i am from australia and visited in the s i returned with my children in the s and again this year with my dad i hope to return again one day ,5,2018-09-01
2038,Walt's dream still rolling,truly amazing that something enjoyed by my grand parents as kids can be enjoyed by my own children so much to see so much to do the max pass was worth every line skipping dime especially now that unlimited digital photos included who needs family selfies with my hairy arm in the picture when you can have professional digital photos sent to your email in about an hour great it is all just amazing ,5,2018-08-31
2039,Son’s 1st Trip,we just took our autistic son to disneyland for his st time and had a blast we stopped at disney city hall upon arriving spoke with them about our son s autism we had a push pull wagon in which our son is comfortable in they gave us a handicap wheelchair tag for his wagon so we could push him in it while waiting in lines it helped us immensely it was a magical time ,5,2018-08-31
2040,Awful place now. Save your money!!,disneyland used to be one of our favorite places to go now is awful starts when you get off freeway then get taken all around the place as the signs are awful and traffic even worse terrible the way they have reconfigured with all the construction etc making it hard used to be got off freeway and wend straight into parking no more and good luck trying to follow signs when you finally get to parking lot is nowhere close and you get to pay they park you in so tight can barely open your doors of course did not stop people next to us from putting their doors into our car then you get to walk almost quarter mile to wait in line for a shuttle as you are so far away cannot walk to resort or take monorail etc anymore you get to stand out in sun and wait we waited over minutes to get on the bus is at least air conditioned but they cram you in like sardines after minute ride you get dropped off and get to walk to multiple rounds of security where you get rudely treated by security minimum wage security with attitudes felt sorry for person in front of us they are awful and make your day start out great sarcasm now finally in get to deal with long lines high prices strollers slammed into you all day long they do not even shade the lines or have spray water like universal studios knotts or magic mountain to name a few of course for their workers they do but forget their guests rudest people ever and to top off when we returned to car our hubcap was stolen of course not their fault so gets you nothing as no security or anyone trying to help or make your visit enjoyable awful place now so save your money ,1,2018-08-30
2041,Wonderful Two Day Visit,disneyland new fails to disappoint i have not been to the park in more than years and the place still amazes me the areas for small children is much nicer than i remember and not at all intimidating for small children with disabilities as was in our party the have one suggestion i have is if you have a day pass or better and wish to rent a mobility scooter that you can get a discount for day etc still on a first come first serve basis but it would be helpful but overall great experience ,4,2018-08-30
2042,Happiest place on the west coasr,our family loves disneyland it s a distant second to disney world but because of location it s our top destination for vacation ,5,2018-08-30
2043,One magical day,we took advantage of our friends season passes and got the friends deal our friend with a pass could buy us two tickets at almost off for each ticket we used our hotel key from paradise pier for the magic hour and used our park hopper tickets to enjoy every moment the park was open we left with blisters thank you disneyland first aid for the bandaids and hearts full of memories to last a lifetime ,5,2018-08-30
2044,Nice trip with child on spectrum,this is a lovely park clean and with rides for all ages the disability pass for our little one with autism wasn t the best though there were insufficient kiosks where to get a pass for the next ride and often after we waiting outside of the line we still had to wait a long time in line which is a problem when you have autism staff here didn t seem as nice as in california adventure the staff on small world were borderline rude ,4,2018-08-29
2045,The original has not lost its charm!,the magic kingdom is a blast it has great rides space mountain the matterhorn indiana jones etc fun parades and spectacular fireworks over cinderella s castle the park is smaller than its equivalent in florida so it is easier to navigate but with the smaller size comes larger crowds so the lines for rides can be quite long fast passes definitely come in handy here great times to visit are the fall where the lines are not as long ,5,2018-08-29
2046,Unleash your inner child,what can i say about disney that hasn t been said before it really is the happiest place on earth my wife and i had a fantasmically amazing time people complain about the price of the tickets but i think with the high level of entertainment and experience you ll be hard pressed to find any other theme park that can offer what disney does i have so many memories of disney as a child that each trip is a special adventure down memory lane for me thank you disneyland for keeping something in this world special and fun and safe for all ages ,5,2018-08-29
2047,Great FUN!,disney is a great place for everyone yes there are plenty of things the entire family can enjoy together at disneyland but i mean everyone if you re a couple looking for fun on a date night try one of their great restaurants and ride the rides if you re going solo take advantage of the single rider lines and maybe make a new friend it s also a safe place to let your tweets and teens roam the point i m trying to make is disneyland is for everyone ,5,2018-08-29
2048,You're gonna love it. Here's my advice on how to get the most out of it.,it s disneyland we had one day there and we did almost everything the management and customer service model permeate everything it s smaller and quainter than disney world and therefore easier to manage we took our and year olds and they had a blast here are the things that really helped us stay off site the premium on disney hotels isn t worth it we stayed at a hotel that was a minute walk from the entrance and got a large suite and free breakfast buy maxpass and use it it s more per ticket and allows you to reserve ride times on the most popular attractions we estimate that we saved more than hours in wait time even if you don t buy the pass make sure to use the kiosks that allow you to reserve times it s very much worth it arrive early the gates open at am we were there at am and there already was a line to get in once we got in though we encountered almost no lines on any ride until about am make a list of the attractions in which you re most interested and map out the order in which you ll do them to save time we went through an area at a time tomorrowland frontierland etc which worked really well bring food especially snacks and water bottles food prices were surprisingly reasonable but we really benefited from having snack bars and water we saved money could eat when we wanted and again didn t have to wait on line bring a portable battery for your phone especially if you use maxpass and if you take a lot of pictures you ll run out of charge and there aren t many places to charge your phone stay for the fireworks they re a real treat for the best effect try to stand as much as possible directly in front of the castle ,5,2018-08-29
2049,Underwhelmed at Disneyland and California Adventure,hopefully i can provide some useful information based upon our recent visit to the disneyland parks in anaheim admittedly i am not a fan of amusement parks and this is our third disney experience with the others in orlando my first advise would be to skip disney if you can sell that to your kids it is overpriced overcrowded and generally a disappointing experience i know some people just love the disney experience if that is the case you can stop reading here our one day park hopper ticket day began with a mile ride to the park from our nearby non affiliated hotel am departure and we stepped into california adventure a few minutes after am line for parking took about minutes which on a day where most tracking sites described the attendance as light to average an hour to get into the park is a bit much i think we would have been better with uber but didn t test that theory we had a hopper ticket and eventually departed california adventure at about pm california adventure was okay until about noon when the crowds arrived and wait times went from minutes to to minutes we had paid for fast pass but it was unavailable for the most popular rides with the longest wait times or the time frame was so far out it would not be feasible to save your fast pass until say pm throughout the day rides at both parks were down for unexplained reasons while waiting for the grizzly rapids it went down our fast pass became a flex pass and was eligible for any ride however we decided to switch to disneyland and didn t realize it was exclusive to california adventure when we attempted to use it at space mountain the attendant coldly explained the rules despite the horror on our kids and ours faces she refused to let us pass clearly we misunderstood the flex meaning but would it have devastated the line to let people with kids through you already had our money disney instead we waited an hour and minutes for space mountain as the traditional fast pass we paid for was unavailable for that ride the same cycle continued and fast pass was useless for any ride of note we ended up going on a whopping two rides it s a small world the other in disneyland due to wait times fast pass unavailability or rides being down at one point of the approximately rides in the park were down no idea why but for a disney park and disney price this is unacceptable we stuck around for the short fireworks show which was good but again another issue was getting out not enough trams back to parking garage and a disorganized system for corralling the customers into the trams took over minutes to get in a tram based upon this experience i would not recommend disneyland orlando is a slightly better but if you can skip disney altogether and participate in one of the many socal real world experiences such as beaches parks historical locations i think you can save yourself a lot of money and aggravation in exchange for a truly rewarding day ,2,2018-08-29
2050,Disneyland,what can you say it s disneyland here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday tomorrow and fantasy ,5,2018-08-28
2051,Tickets for Veterans,veteran s you do not have to be retired or active duty to get discounted tickets i used govx com for one day hopper tickets in between the two parks and was able to get a decent discount anywhere you can save is great mom and dad take a book bag pack ziplock bags for cell phones so they don t get wet water lots of sunscreen you can take snacks download the disney app and then for have one person purchase the maxpass which allows you to download all the pictures you have taken within the park use the app to remind you of showtimes for things you want to see print pictures when you get home if you want front row seating at the parades get there hour early and stake your ground disney is jam packed full of people but don t fret best place to view the fireworks at night is right when you exit the two parks in between the parks then make a mad dash to the new orleans area to get a good seat to fantasmic or fantasia forgot the name get there before they rope the area off after that you need a fastpass oh and if you re ever tired of walking ride the train for awhile it s good to catch a breeze and just sit for a bit ,5,2018-08-28
2052,Fist time at LA Disney,we have always gone to disney at orlando but now have move to the other side of the world la is easier to get to was very disappointed it s a lot smaller than orlando due to that it was very crowded we had a day pass but was unable to get a park hopper with a year old we needed days to do every thing if quieter days would be enough the over all experience was good with all staff great but now we are planning to go to orlando even with a fastpass the wait times was terrible with the hotel costs cheaper in orlando and more to see and do this will out way the extra flight ,3,2018-08-28
2053,Disneyland losing some of its magic,disneyland is a wonderful place to visit there are so many great things to see and do and lots of food to try and rides to experiance if you are planning on a disneyland vacation make sure it is the last of your agenda or you will be disappointed if you go to disneyland then another amusement park because the cleanliness and variety at disney far surpass that at other amusement parks you will hardly find a dirty bathroom or trash on the street or overflowing trash cans the maintenance crew does an amazing job at making it beautiful all the time the rides are also great especially now with max pass you can do your fast passes right from your phone without running all over for a day yes that seems like a lot if you are a family of but you could do just one day and get most of the rides you really want done we lived this option when just my husband and i recently went if a ride closed it issued us a fast pass to use anywhere in the park the employees at disney have always made it more magical for us and we experienced that in critter country with a fast member who went above and beyond her job but we also experienced the other end of that with cast members who abruptly take your card or money as your trying to ask a question and just hurry you through the line oh and let s talk about dress code what has happened to disneylands dress code on this recent trip we saw a few bottoms hanging out of shorts and a full moon on one and one woman was wearing a bra no not a tank top a bra seriously i couldn t believe it oh and city hall used to be pur favorite place to stop but on this trip and the trip prior we haven t been able to even just enter without talking to the cast member outside and then they let us in or not they are nice and kind and maybe it s to help it from getting to busy in there but we miss the simplicity of it ,3,2018-08-28
2054,The original,where the magic started and great fun not quite as good or as impressive as magic kingdom in orlando but that is due to the limited space they have we loved spending a day here indiana jones ride is great,5,2018-08-28
2055,A magical day!,my friend and i celebrated our th birthdays at disneyland what a magical day i had my first dole whip had my picture made with mickey mouse and rode or saw more than attractions during the course of a long hot day even though we went on a sunday in july it was manageable and not nearly as crowded as i had feared the longest we waited to ride a ride was minutes for space mountain but so worth it as it s the best ride and smoother than disney world s version worth the trip and wish i had had the time to see california adventure maybe next time get the photo pass and definitely take advantage of fast passes when you can ,5,2018-08-28
2056,Different expectations,let me start by saying i m over and remember what disneyland was like back in the day so my expectations are different from those i took this adventure with this experience was wonderful because of being with my son s family not because of the place disneyland is only the happiest place on earth if you think spending over per day per adult for entry fee to wait in line anywhere from mins to hours is fun they sucked us in to paying an extra a day per person for maxi pass what a joke the idea is you make a reservation to get on popular rides and not wait hours what happens is when making a reservation at am the soonest you can get on a ride is at pm and you can t make any other reservation until you ve use the one what it s less frustrating to get a flight out of o hare during a blizzard anyway the only way i would go back is if my granddaughter asked me and i won free tickets boo on disney for cramming so many people into so little space ,3,2018-08-28
2057,Happy Place!,we celebrated our kids birthdays here last week we went on the first day allowed back with our annual passes after the summer block out it was very packed that day but our max passes made the day enjoyable and not stressful the next day was a lot less busy we had the best time ,5,2018-08-28
2058,Nostalgic Location,if you love disney you have to go to disneyland at least once in your life the atmosphere is so nostalgic to be walking where walt disney once walked the parades are amazing actually the best i have ever say pixar parade the park is kept very clean and food options in the park would suit any taste if you are in the la area you should definitely visit ,5,2018-08-28
2059,Fun!!,disneyland is the most magical place it truly is the happiest place on earth we ve been disneyland guests for many years and will continue for many more years some complain about the cost you get what you pay for in our opinion it s worth every penny ,5,2018-08-27
2060,Pay for the MAX pass it is worth it. During the busy summer months we didn't have to wait long and rode some rides 2x's,b sure to see the show frozen absolutely wonderful go when it is hot during the afternoon don t kit in the balcony if you have a choice it is too far away singing was fab ,5,2018-08-27
2061,Happiest Place On Earth,you probably already know what you think about disneyland even if you have never been there it is the platonic ideal of a theme park even more than its counterpart in orlando the major negative is that it is almost constantly grossly over crowded disney has over sold its annual passports and does not effectively limit sales at the gate i am not really sure why they do that because the least crowded areas of the park are food stalls and retail stores everything else is so crowded that it really hurts the experience that said the disney magic is real the hooks the park has into memories that you have of childhood and are able to share with your own children are amazing walt disney designed an amazing place and it has generally been extremely well maintained ,5,2018-08-27
2062,We enjoyed more than WDW,while disney world has many parks and many hotels we thoroughly enjoyed disneyland because it is much more manageable it still offers many of the same amazing rides but was not nearly as crowded as the florida park if we go back to a disney park this would be the one,5,2018-08-27
2063,It’s only about to get better and better,my family and i go here every year sometimes twice a year because my wife is obsessed with disneyland we have friends in orange ca which is the only way we could afford to visit as much as we do way too expensive for day passes especially since the family keeps growing argh that said my daughter turns two next month and we are so excited for our next visit as she loves all the disney characters and has become so expressive the rides are classic but i don t care if i ever ride pirates again unless it s remade ha not likely space mountain and what not are great it s a small world holds up with small children haven t had to visit bibbity boopity boo yet so that s a plus enjoy the memories we make every time ,5,2018-08-27
2064,Happiest place on earth!!!,it s tradition we always go this time of year all the christmas trimmings and spirit is a must experience ,5,2018-08-27
2065,disneyland california adventure Disaster,taking a long awaited disneyland adventure with my handicap granddaughter once a place that thrilled everyone now only after money to make a long disaster short hours to get into our hotel california room handicap wheelchair lost lobby block off dirt everywhere special room to over look park missing view totally misinformed no one ever told use the total hotel was under construction i tell everyone never go i m so disappointed it s taken me forever to send this it s not walt disney ,1,2018-08-27
2066,Bday vaca fun,disneyland is hands down the greatest we have to save recyclables and jars of coins the whole family pitches in just to go wish it wasn t so expensive for a family of six we save for room travel food disneyland tickets and souvenirs if we can ,5,2018-08-27
2067,Disneyland park and Disney California Adventure Park visit August 2018,we visited both disney parks and as they rightly call it the happiest place on earth disney definitely ticked all it s the best place to visit we all had a blast from the thrills rides and the parade it was non stop fun and the fireworks to end the day was an icing on top of the cake again we will be visiting an amazing day we had which will live in our memories forever ,5,2018-08-27
2068,Magic!,what can anyone say disneyland is simply magic from the moment you enter the park till your tired body demand you let it sleep disneyland dazzles and delights ,5,2018-08-27
2069,Disney family,well worth every penny never disappointed when we come love love the disney pixar fest so amazing watching the shows,5,2018-08-27
2070,Still and will always be the happiest place in Earth!,i will never get tired of disneyland our and yr old children had the best time but guess what i think the parents enjoyed it even more than their children the best part is at nigh when you get to watch fantasmic i would suggest to families to stay late it is so worth it you enter the park with a big smile you leave with a bigger smile my facial muscles got tired of smiling lol sure the tickets can get expensive on peak seasons but hey you cannot buy joy and happy memories especially when you are with your children kids and adults kids at heart will surely have a blast ,5,2018-08-27
2071,Disneyland Park is better.,what i like about the disneyland park is that it is easy to get around and california adventure is next door ,5,2018-08-27
2072,Always a fun time,we are annual passholders so we tend to go to disneyland pretty often i would say we visit disneyland or more times a year and it s always a lot of fun often the lines are fairly long for individual rides but we tend to go for about three hours at a time since we do have the annual passes we usually grab a bite to eat maybe do a little shopping and two to three or maybe four rides always great fun time but just be prepared to wait sometimes our favorite time to go is friday mornings around or and stay till about two in the afternoon that seems to be the best for the rides as far as the lines go often the middle of the week is good too ,5,2018-08-27
2073,Great place for young kids,disneyland it has been one place that typically and kid would get excited about we visited disney with out year old daughter for her birthday getting early to join the lines is a god idea but not that it is critical the only time you would want to be in early lines is if there is a possibility of such an overcrowding that the gates will be shut so the place is made for kids that are years or less most of the rides are very mild but engaging for the kids of that age there are just rides that will be scary for kids the best attraction is the disney characters interaction kids just love those and the characters are also very engaging and kids friendly the fireworks at the end of the evening are simply amazing folks do wait for a long time in front of the castle to catch the best view of the fireworks but actually it is all visible from the main street and you can see if from there too the food options are aplenty from hot dogs to french cuisine just that everything is super pricey even the water bottles are very expensive the water fountains are far and few and some how dont taste good my suggestion for a day to be spent there would be to do some homework about what ride your kid would want to and which ones they can skip focus on the selected rides and the character meets get a lot of sun screen snacks and water getting a stroller will be a good idea as kids do get tired walking too much do get the disneypass as it is super convenient and you get all the photos clicked by disney photographers of your kid with the characters if you have a birthday kid with you do get the birthday badge from the city hall that is located right close to the entrance your kid will get a pin with he name on it and everyone will wish him her happy birthday your kid might like some rides a lot and would want to do them again use the disneypass to book them if the wait is too much do carry a power bank to charge your phone as you will need it for disneypass all day long if you have kids and they dont like the same rides then it will be better to split into disneypass groups you can still go on the rides together by booking on both passes but if you want to split rides then that option is better fantasmic is another great show on water you must get eh disneypass booking done else it gets too crowded and you will have to stand for long to catch the show there are other live shows and performances thru the park all day and they are really good try and catch some it will also give you some time to sit and rest i bought snacks from the carts liked the turkey leg you can find the cart locations on the website if you have elderly people with you an electric scooter might be handy as the walking distances are a lot we walked about steps in one day the only alert is that bigger kids might find this too much of a kidsy place so please be sure if disney is the right place for them or you will rather go to universal ,4,2018-08-27
2074,Get the FastPass!!,when getting our tickets and we stated it was our first visit here it was mentioned we should get the fastpass so glad we spent the extra per person saved tons of time must get the disneyland app not enough words to say it is magical a must do for everyone i am and bought me a mickey mouse cap ,5,2018-08-27
2075,Worst park ever, crowded too many people all the restaurants rides was full with crazy lines even the free rest chairs was full no where to sit long line to have photo with characters don t got in trap and buy fast pass tickets because even with fast pass you have to wait hours at least for each ride we spend for no single ride just gift shops to avoid hot weather and enjoying the free show for once we spent hours for the parks then back home we couldn t bear the crowds and rude people there limited rides selection the one in paris much peter if you in la go for universal studio which is better not recommended never be back,2,2018-08-27
2076,Rides,we were disappointed that we couldn t go on some of the rides because the lines were too long pirates alice in wonderland the haunted mansion was closed we didn t like the hastle o the fast pass ,4,2018-08-27
2077,Happiest place on earth,enough said fave rides pirates haunted house space mountain jungle cruise thunder mountain indiana jones splash miuntain incredicoaster soaring around the world guardians of the galaxy grizzly river run ,5,2018-08-27
2078,Happiest Place On Earth!,our family of went for a fun weekend away and loved visiting the park the lines weren t too bad and everyone got to do different things all over the park we can t wait to go back next year ,5,2018-08-27
2079,Perez family vacation,spent a great days with our son daughter in law and three grandchildren for their first time at disneyland they were really enjoying themselves ,5,2018-08-27
2080,First trip to Disneyland,we were like kids again went on the harry potter ride it was really great but scary with twists and turns not sure was coming next but getting to the ride was even better going through the castle went to the wand room a must see the harry potter then went a lot more rides not scary ones just mild ones a great place,5,2018-08-27
2081,Great fun at Disneyland!,we had an amazing time celebrating our honeymoon here with our year old son it was amazing we got a fastpass for both parks and we would highly recommend this when its very busy it was very hot so we arrived very early and did as much as possible in the morning ,5,2018-08-27
2082,Say hi to THE MOUSE!,disneyland is amazing try the hamburger at the hungry bear restaurant also chicken at the plaza inn is a great value and very delicious ,5,2018-08-27
2083,Happiest place on earth,i always have a good time here i mostly like the classic rides there are some standouts i think the haunted house here is the best indiana jones ride is amazing even after so many years also i believe space mountain here is the best while on the jungle cruise our skipper was especially funny he abandoned many of the old jokes for new ones some were pretty funny only downside matterhorn has been closed for renovations the last two visits it s never a perfect disney day without a ride on matterhorn ,4,2018-08-26
2084,Disney under repair,i love disney always have always will i couldn t give stars this time around because the wi fi was not up to disney standards there were too many low bar spots around the park there was too much construction during the summer season i was looking forward to the matterhorn but it was broken the monorail wasn t running because it was too hot florida has air conditioning why doesn t southern california i will be going back some day but florida is the place to be when it comes to disney ,4,2018-08-26
2085,Waayyyyy to.many people.,a sea of too many people thousands of strollers rude people wait even with fast pass uggggggg not like the good ole days never coming back ,2,2018-08-26
2086,Total Class Act as always. Disney is the bar to teach.,been to numerous worldwide disney theme parks and they never fail to impress the general feel of the place as soon as you walk in the cleanliness the smiling faces are all part of the magic more compact than disneyworld with a lot smaller castle but i found it easy to get around less walking to get to places we had an excellent meal outside at the carnation cafe and reserved a time so we could watch the parade go past from our table as soon as we entered we were welcomed onboard the disney fire truck the actual one disney used to use and yes i rang the bell one small criticism is that outside lines in high temperatures could be covered in summer with more cooling fans some of the lines were minutes my wife found this difficult and very few places had water fountains near the lines at the time of our visit it was pixar fest and these majored over the traditional micky and minnie characters not our preference but still good one word of advice when leaving the park for your parking lot do not pass through the security lines exiting until you are sure you are on the right exit side we ended up leaving on the toy story side and realized our mistake but too late we had to line up through security again for minutes just to exit the park again ,5,2018-08-26
2087,Good entertainment for kids,so come on it is disneyland who can give mickey less than stars as a parent i would give why the price has just gotten out of control family of four at least a dollar day but that is not it the crowds seems like the city does not place an occupancy limit on this place hour wait in line for a good ride not uncommon so why stars if you have you kids still excited about mickey and all the characters then it is worth it they can t go on the big rides so lines are smaller and i always see tons of smiles on the little ones so bring money but enjoy,4,2018-08-26
2088,Somewhere everyone must go!,such a magic day no matter what age you are i was visiting a family member out in california and we decided to go and visit for her birthday despite the rain which was actually not a bad thing as the park was quiet no queues it was a fantastic day the park offer badges my friend had a birthday one and myself a first timer badge despite the incredibly pricey entrance fee it did feel worth it the food places weren t too bad considering where you are the busy amusements also offer a pass so you can skip the queue on busy rides which is something i ve never personally seen before a very good system everything very well organised and an adventure day everyone must experience ,4,2018-08-26
2089,Magical,must visit place for all ages lovely rides and food snacks and drinks for energy after just spending a magical day out everyday is practically a peak day so don t matter when you go at this world renown spot,5,2018-08-26
2090,Everything you would expect,disney as a whole has it right everything you expect decent rides friendly staff well kept park clean toilet facilities and a host of foods at inflated prices despite charging the earth for entry i know that it is just a place you go to once and you don t live in the park but why the need to spank your backside for getting hungry ,4,2018-08-25
2091,Excellent as always,great day as always got preferred parking they are so organised such a good day left when it closed expensive of course but worth it never get tired of disney ,5,2018-08-25
2092,"Wish we could dislike Disneyland, but just can’t",we were at disneyland years ago when my son was and we said we would return one more time for the benefit of my daughter first time they are and our greatest frustration was line ups and with disney s maxpass service a steal at per person a day our experience this time was vastly different than years ago maxpass allows you to schedule fastpasses for some of the most popular rides and plan your day accordingly we never waited in a line for more than minutes using a fast pass and it made our experience so much more efficient we also got to the park early usually by am we went third week of august and some of our days looked like this first thing in the morning fast pass radiator springs racers for later in the day then go on space mountain over rated by the way but my son loves it walked on in standby star tour walked on in standby thunder mountain walked on in mins mins later can fast pass another selection so fast passed soaring over the world for later in the day then walked onto splash mountain less than min standby before am then headed over to california adventure for frozen at hyperion theatre to line up at about am note go to the bathroom before lining up and have all your party with you there are not washrooms in the theatre and very difficult to leave and come back also no holding spots in line or seats in theatres for people who aren t there frozen was hour and it was awesome then had lunch fast pass grizzly river minutes after we fast passed soaring went on radiator springs racer fast pass went on soaring fast pass went on grizzly fast pass then went back to our hotel at about pm for a dip in the pool and a rest while at the hotel scheduled fast pass for evening rides indiana jones space mountain and usually thunder mountain either had supper in downtown disney or back at the park around pm went on more rides that we fast passed then watch fireworks of fantastic we packed a lot into the day but it was very intensive for mom the organizer who also coordinated with other families have to be very planful and constantly checking app for fastpass times that work in your schedule worth it to make all our day run smoothly but definitely need a beach day to recover after this week we did the river belle dining package for fantasmic to get the preferred dining fastpass section it was worth every penny we could bring our blanket and sit down and enjoy the show only went at and got an awesome spot the regular fastpass sections are standing and packed in very tightly tough for small kids or short people to see we also got to stay there for the pixar and fireworks show at following fantasmic my year old daughters favs splash mountain thunder mountain radiator spring racers found indiana jones which she was barely tall enough for boring my year old son s favs space mountain grizzly river run soaring my favs soaring many rides will make you scream this ride will make you smile radiator spring racers splash mountain scariest one of the mountains dining at disney is very easy there is your standard pizza burgers junk that kids eat but i found there is equally great selection of salads which are very yummy the ambiance is both frustrating with the crowds but at the same time magical with all the special feelings it elicits with their programming and fun it is a magical place that can t keep you away it s unlike anywhere else that is priceless ,5,2018-08-25
2093,More then expected,our vacation was well worth every penny i can say download the app a few weeks before and get use to using the map very user friendly and maxpass is worth the photos alone we had days in parks if you like shows you will need more then one day in california adventures even in days we still missed a few things the night time shows and fireworks ar wellworth the wait best seats for fantasmic are in front of priates kids meals arepriced welland come with enough for a adult or party consisted of month old year old year old year old year olds year old,5,2018-08-25
2094,"No matter the age, you'll love it!",what can one say about the mouse it s someplace you have to visit try the riverboat ride indiana jones adventure and the enchanted tiki room visit space mountain and check out star wars don t count on the monorail running i haven t seen it run since i was a child not that i get there very often ,4,2018-08-25
2095,Excellent Theme Park,we ve been to disney world in orlando and to many other theme parks but it was our first time at the original disneyland and we were very impressed this park is well laid out it s full of attractions and shops rather than rides and events such as the parade make it very special highly recommended whether you re a theme park person or not ,5,2018-08-25
2096,LOVE IT,we are a disney family we love it it can be busy and crowded but mostly people are nice lines on the left usual move faster ,5,2018-08-25
2097,AMAZING Day!,my husband and i visited yesterday he hadn t been in years and it s been since i visited we had an amazing time love disney it s showing it s age in some areas but disney is always magical and we loved that the lines went fast and we re able to ride a ton of rides and the max pass and ability to link photos and download them to your phone is amazing and absolutely worth the extra loved the indiana jones ride great day ,5,2018-08-25
2098,"Full of Disney Magic, but Falls a Bit Short",to be clear i am a huge disney fan having been to each other disney location world wide we decided to wrap up our collection by going back to where it all began disneyland park is still full of disney magic especially remembering that walt disney himself walked this park making it extra special keeping in mind that this was the first of its kind does offer a bit of charm but when i compare it to other disney parks we have been to it just doesn t quite stack up i think i have been on a better version of almost every ride that it offers i think i would have overlooked that if the service level were on par with what i have come to expect from disney but somehow it just didn t quite cut it the employees seemed to just be doing their job and we didn t have any spectacular interactions that seemed to make the true magic happen don t get me wrong it is still a great park but when compared with other disney experiences this may have been my most disappointing that said i still would go again given the opportunity ,4,2018-08-25
2099,So much fun!!,disneyland never falls to keep smiles on our faces and memories in our minds thank you walt for a truly magical time ,5,2018-08-24
2100,My child's dream,finally i visited this place those were amazing days on our back to canada we couldn t go to everything but we went to most of all anyhow place to visit at all ,5,2018-08-24
2101,Multiple trips over many years,we surprised the kids with another trip to disneyland we don t buy the park hopper passes anymore as we realized we only need one day in california adventure and we don t need a full day there we actually went back to the hotel to rest for the remainder of the early evening i m hoping ca gets a section of the park exclusively for marvel maybe someday also spent two days in disneyland which is always enough for us plan to go again after starwars land opens ,5,2018-08-24
2102,Great visit,as always magical guest services is accommodating the stores have great souvenirs although a little less variety than previous years ride lines are pretty well kept in check fastpass are great there are amazing photo ops the food is delicious need i go on the one issue we encountered is when you have a large family it is difficult to navigate large crowds and all stay together i am accustomed to couples visits and trying to stay with a large group was challenging particularly during night shows ,5,2018-08-24
2103,Great fun for a family of four with two teenagers,very busy and overwhelming lines queues but once our fast pass bookings kicked we had a great time our finale was splash mountain just before midnight we did pay the extra for each ticket to enable fast pass bookings to be made on the app which made our planning much easier and allowed us to get the most out of our day ,5,2018-08-24
2104,"Brillant fun, quiet in Febuary",we managed to jump on most rides within minutes so would recommend visiting in feb we stayed for the whole day and would highly recommend the show in the evening our best ride was indiana jones ,5,2018-08-24
2105,Fun,i purposely booked the trip after school started thinking i could avoid crowds i was wrong disneyland is so fun with little kids my kids are so they can ride most rides there s nothing really bad to say about the park besides the wait times and crowds it s clean plenty of seats to sit lots of food options and plenty of rides to enjoy morning time we went to plaza inn for character breakfast it s a buffet style breakfast they put us in a corner that was hard to get to for most character so they d just walk by a couple came back and made the kids happy it was a cool experience but storyteller cafe in grand california is way better the parade was pretty fun and with pixar characters the kids really loved this and it had little water guns on most of the floats that would spray the crowd i ll be back to disneyland cause i know my kids will always love the trip best family fun ,5,2018-08-23
2106,Hppiest Place On Earth...Awwww yeah!,how can not love disneyland everything about disneyland is perfect and quite honesty other theme parks should learn from them nothing too negative to write food can be a bit pricey but honestly not as bad dollar wise as other places like sports stadiums and convention centers assume per entre per person but portions are good sized and often fed i highly recommend the fast pass this is an additional pp per day but since you are already spending pp per day for the ticket an extra isn t that much more what you get for it is a world of convenience and freedom you can get fast passes right though your phone so you don t need to go to the ride first to get a fast pass and then return you also can get more fast passes faster with fast pass and you get unlimited free photos taken by cast members they take the best and most professional pictures at the best locations including with characters we had over a hundred pictures taken throughout the park and they download to the app and then from the app to my personal storage and it made building a scrapbook of memories so much easier also included are pictures taken from the rides like splash mountain incredicoaster and guardians mission breakout it s a deal and we never waited more than a minute to get on a ride when our fast pass came up be sure to do the tiki hut usually there s no line and grab a dole pineapple whip just outside and bring it in tiki hut is an original attraction lots of seating and an air conditioned break on a hot day it s also a ton of fun for everyone ,5,2018-08-23
2107,It’s Disney,disney land is crowded and expensive but most people know this going in the new max pass option allows you to get s fast pass on your phone not too bad ,4,2018-08-23
2108,Mr Walt’s dream is dying,i ve been many times to the parks both in anaheim and orlando and as the time goes by the experience gets worse at disneyland park in anaheim my last visit even when the family spent a nice holidays the park itself was a poor experience since in my perspective the obsession for profits overcome the visitos s experience that is it s getting more important to them to make obscene revenues at the time they are forgetting the visitor s unforgettable and magic experience the park was created for the restaurants rides shops photo opportunities are sooo overcrowded that you spend most of your magic time standing in line that insaine amount of visitors impacts in dirty restaurants with napkins and french fries all over the floor and seats all wet restrooms and constant closure of the rides caused by failures some places are torn down abandoned and useless like the former people mover and the carrousel of progress closing the park for a refurbish are you completely deranged the matterhorn ride is a piece of junk bolts and nuts fly behind you as you feel loosen and torn wheels and carts photo opportunity with a character get in a large line and be quick the former smiling costumed hostess now is a grumpy lady with a radio in a mcdonald s uniform well i could keep writing how different it was or years ago but the new management are great making profits but they clearely are missing the point let me share with you the official mission statement and please tell me where in the world is stated the customer experience fun magic moments sorry walt they made it a cave of thieves official statement to be one of the world s leading producers and providers of entertainment and information using our portfolio of brands to differentiate our content services and consumer products we seek to develop the most creative innovative and profitable entertainment experiences and related products in the world ,2,2018-08-23
2109,Completing the Disney experience - where it all began,if you love disney and have visited other parks as we have on numerous occasion florida and paris and japan once you will love it if not then avoid it s a little smaller than florida and has some rides and areas nowhere else has new orleans winnie pooh ride amazing indiana jones adventure and even pirates of the caribbean was different it was as magical as ever and the fantasmic show is incredible and a must see the castle is tiny compared to the other parks but it has a whole other charm as it s the original loads of water fountains so no need to buy expensive drinks and it was hot all day pre book a dinner and fantasmic guaranteed place to watch if you can disney app allows you to pre book your fast passes too whilst in the park if you e bought a max pas ticket ,5,2018-08-23
2110,A good expierence,a very well organize adventure park if you have kids not more years you have to visit if you can pay the fast pass do it ,4,2018-08-22
2111,Disney Magic Strikes Again!,we loved our visits to disneyland park we ve been to florida paris so wanted to go to where it all began the park is obviously much smaller than florida but there is still the same disney magic the castle is much smaller and is dwarfed by the bobsled mountain which takes some getting used to we took advantage of the max pass system and used this to secure fast passes for the more popular rides we got to the park very early which is a must to maximise your time wear some comfortable footwear clothing there are not as many photo pass photographers as florida but it was great fun all the same ,5,2018-08-22
2112,Total Nightmare,the park was extremely crowded adding to the frustration was that disney was operating some rides at half capacity resulting in epic long lines food was mediocre and incredibly overpriced minute minimum wait for a sit down dining experience very trashy guests locals were on their smartphones during dark rides ruining the experience had a day park hopper ticket after hours left and flew home days early because disneyland was such a bust ,1,2018-08-22
2113,"Go early, stay late!",if you want to get the most out of your very expensive tickets be prepared for a long day download the disneyland interactive map that shows you queue times bring a packed lunch and comfortable shoes days before you go check what queue times are like so that when the park opens you know which rides to head for first it s a beautiful park with so much to see and do get to parade areas early to get a good spot and the night time shows even earlier make sure you ask employees if where you are stood is ok to avoid being moved on minutes before the shows tickets may be pricey but once inside you can see why a truly magical experience parking costs ,5,2018-08-22
2114,The original Disney,we have been to disney parks in orlando and paris and this by far is the friendless so far all members of staff we approached were friendly and helpful we had a couple of issues which was dealt with in a efficient and agreeable way there are only two parks which means the parks are busy unlike orlando where the spread of guests would be greater as there are more parks this does cause busy parks and long lines for rides use the fast pass system effectively it shows you the time you can next get your fast pass use this to the maximum it s usually available again after two hours but as the day goes on this time scale decreases if the ride lines say mins etc double it and you won t be disappointed on the wait the fast pass lines take priority always check the weekly time documents for the park these are available at information as early hours and other attraction times do change daily and weekly if in doubt ask we have used disney parks a lot so we pretty much knew what to expect if you love disney you will love it here ,5,2018-08-22
2115,Disneyland in Mid August,went to disneyland the day after all the local schools started back so there wasn t that long of lines for anything to be honest the longest lines were for space mountain minutes and the starbucks if you ve been to disney world s the magic kingdom you will find this park to be very similar the huge bonus to me was it was august and there was no humidity there are rides here hat have been opened since the park opened back in also some of these rides don t exist anywhere else so that s pretty awesome lastly the park is not that big so you can do multiple laps around the place and stay under miles ,5,2018-08-21
2116,Frequent DisneyWorld visitor - first time to the original,i always wanted to visit disneyland since i was a young kid the matterhorn is a disneyland exclusive and it was always at the top of my wish list and it not disappoint the entire park in comparison to the magic kingdom is smaller but it still feels full and expansive the counterpart version of the rides in florida seemed better to me at the original disney land park for example their pirates of the caribbean ride was much longer and had drops and twists i was not expecting also disneyland has barely started to incorporate the magic band system in the park so it still uses an antiquated ticketing system that actually works in your favor when booking rides using the tickets we were able to ride nearly every ride in the park in one single day the few negatives in the park include a lack of shows in comparison to its florida cousin and the terrible parking system and lack of hotels around the park overall i the entire experience was fun but not nearly as magical as the magic kingdom experience due to these few flaws ,4,2018-08-21
2117,First trip- and it was awesome!!!,i have been to walt disney world in florida a bunch of times before children and with children and it is one of my favorite places to visit so i had to see where it all started my family and i were visiting california for days starting in san diego and ending with disneyland from our hotel we were able to see the fireworks the first few nights and when we were in the park it was so much better although i will say that disney world edges out it s west coast cousin i will say disneyland has a charm and feeling that is all it s own it is great to see the world that walt envisioned and where it all began also the west coast does have the better version of pirates and space mountain and they still have mr toad and mickey minnie s house and toontown will definitely visit again ,5,2018-08-21
2118,Expensive but worth it,this was the better of the two parks for me be warned the queue can be hours for some rides so fast pass is a must it can mean if you plan you day use your fast pass to the max you can do a lot of the parking hours if not you will be lucky to do rides these is still some magic left here although the shops and food seem a rip off if prices were realistic i would be much more willing to spend money however with rip off prices i just walk in by i would recommend buying disney toys in walmart before hand and giving them to the children while at disney so you can avoid the shops the shops are totally not magical at those prices however some astonishing rides a well lid out park and it took my breath away on a coolness scale a couple of times tip oh the queue just to get in the park can take upto hour security try to arrive for it will save you lots of time outside and then in the actual park rides are very quiet so use this time wisely and selfie sticks are banned ,4,2018-08-21
2119,Terrible.,previously visited disneyland in other than the prices very little has changed yes nostalgia and heritage has its place but under investment does not took my year son to disneyland who is a huge disney fan he left very disappointed and has zero desire to return the main rides frequently broke down frustrating when you have a fast pass to use the queues for a lot of the rides are plain stupid we saw mins for some who in their right mind is happy standing in line for an hour and a half with little shade some families bypass the concept of getting in line together by sending one parent to queue then phoning the rest of the family when they re close to the ride and the rest of the family then barges past those in line to get to the front to join the other parent saw this happen a lot unlike other parks there are hardly any fans spraying water mist to keep guests cool in line i guess that s too much money for disney to spend or maybe they just want to keep the original feel look of the place and such things would look out of place i somehow doubt that though far too many people are allowed in on any given day to allow guests to enjoy their visit we still love disney the movies characters and imagination of it all but disneyland wasn t for us ,1,2018-08-21
2120,"First time, pretty incredible!",my first time ever was quite the experience the rides were incredibly well done food was tasty and decor was incredibly detailed some things i didnt care for were the hours of walking the layout is pretty confusing and illogical to me and i was in a lot of pain by the end of the day also of course it is astronomically expensive all in all though a really fun time that i would recommend everyone do at least once ,5,2018-08-21
2121,Love Disneyland! But prices are high,well this is one of my favorite places the happiest place in the world i have been going to disneyland since i was a baby and still love it but i will advise that the parking and entrance fees have gone up so expect to pay well over bucks for parking entrance and food its not a cheap trip when you start adding in family members but such a fun memorable experience its a must do when visiting the area ,5,2018-08-20
2122,Fun place for a date!,my wife and i come at least once a month the customer service is always good and there are a lot of great places to eat i would say the one thing that they should add is like an adult rest nap area after walking for hours you can get really exhausted ,4,2018-08-20
2123,Fun times at Disneyland,besides dealing with the hot weather and the many many many steps to getting around disneyland was amazing i do suggest to get the extra pass to get on the rides quicker and arrive early to the park we completed the park in one day the parade and the fireworks is a must see i suggest anyone with little children to get a day pass ,4,2018-08-20
2124,Magical,out teens have visited the fl disney parks but it was their first trip to disneyland we were surprised they wanted to go since they are and they really enjoyed the day we arrived at am and stayed until pm the fantasia show was a highlight of the day get tickets to the show as soon as you arrive so you have a decent view the mattahorn ride was permanently closed down when we visited space mtn was having technical difficulties so we didn t get to ride that either for rides they really liked pirates star wars buzz thunder the fast pass is worth the money even though it s only good on certain rides if you want to take the riverboat ride or see the island do it early in the day since it closes down in the afternoon to prepare for the shows we wish someone had told us that we ate at the mexican restaurant and the food wasn t bad the restaurant by splash mtn has a special menu for food sensitivities but you have to ask the cashier to see it ,5,2018-08-20
2125,Great Family Destination,the happiest place on earth certainly delivers an amazing experience for the whole family it is a place for everyone you can find kid friendly and family friendly rides or you can enjoy fun exciting rides with your older children ,5,2018-08-20
2126,So much fun!!,we spent the day at disneyland and couldn t be more thrilled at it being empty zero lines on a wednesday so much fun we went early around am and stayed until closing at vegetarians the salads are excellent at the cafe near space mountain just ask them to make you one with no meat you can also easily fill up your water bottles here we also had a delicious cauliflower burger at a restaurant near the pinocchio ride for dinner for large families like us adults kids we tried to hit the back of the park first it was empty as we were one of the first to arrive at normal park hours this is because people coming in tended to hang around the rides near the entrance we went in got our fast pass to star tours then went to pirates haunted mansion some log mountain ride and indiana jones no kidding we walked all the way up to the rides no lines for those looking for a clean inexpensive hotel we stayed at the radisson on beach blvd near knotts berry farm why because they offer free parking a free shuttle to from disneyland and we were able to walk to knotts berry farm the shuttle made our stay at disney even better it dropped us off super close to the entrance no parking far off then taking a shuttle to the park it was so easy and free ,5,2018-08-20
2127,...always entertaining,lots of people as expected but well behaved came on a monday before school started any day is a good day just enjoy enjoy ,4,2018-08-20
2128,Nostalgic,we can all appreciate the original disneyland and how forward thinking walt was when he created the park its a bit outdated but its got all the charm you d expect some classic rides like its a small word peter pan snow white dumbo teacups and the haunted mansion are all there not to mention space mountain a few of the newer rides include indiana jones and star tours we had a great day ,5,2018-08-20
2129,"Do your homework ahead of time or get the ""leftovers"" -- Reservations & Technology WIN here!!!",bucket list family trip for with nights in disney hotel this place is driven organized for advance reservations so days out make significant dinner reservations pool cabana reservations and the like if you show up without them virtually nothing available and no preference for hotel guests per se use the technology get the disney app use the fastpass get the park hopper option to max your time read ta reviews we used disney staff for birthday dinner reservation in park plus tickets plus adventure tower club rooms upon arrival all disney cast staff just outstanding in every way customer focused competent cheerful disney hotel is fantastic in every respect e ticket club is outstanding and great benefit ,5,2018-08-20
2130,Nice trip but way behind in technology,we anticipated the park being smaller than disney world but didn t anticipate it being so behind in technology fast pass program is ridiculous we had a nice time but it could have been so much easier nothing combined separate park passes fast pass hotel key etc get the park to the future please ,3,2018-08-19
2131,A Special Birthday Celebration,came here with my husband and his family for a birthday celebration we all had a great time the blue bayou restaurant is the coolest place to eat at it is kind of part of the pirates of the caribbean ride ,5,2018-08-19
2132,Trip of a lifetime!,what a magical place get there early to avoid the queues use the fast passes they are a great option pack water snacks and sunscreen there are plenty of food options and we found them quite reasonable price wise take a day to orient yourself to the park and do some rides and then come back the next day and do the rides that you ve missed when the queues are low and it s cooler in the morning ,5,2018-08-19
2133,THE MAX PASS,disneyland really is the best place on earth we ve been disneyland so many times but i decided to write this review so i can inform everyone you absolutely have to download the disney app and after you purchase your tickets when you enter the park you buy what s called a max pass the max pass cost additional dollars per ticket but you re able to book ahead of time to ride you want to go on we were there over fourth of july which is one of the busiest weekends and we did not wait in a line for longer than minutes max pass also gives you all of your pictures throughout the park for free i was dreading this trip thinking we wouldn t be able to get on any rides but by far we were able to get on more than we ever have ,5,2018-08-19
2134,I LOVE DISNEYLAND,disneyland will always be my number one favorite theme park even over disney world my kids are a little older now and my youngest had more fun this year as she was able to ride more rides the park is always clean the crowds are crazy but it s always well managed i love going and i want to go back already please keep doing what you are doing ,5,2018-08-19
2135,The Best of Disney,the original park has beauty cuteness and many features that the magic kingdom does not have had not been here in many years seeing the original pirates ride was wonderful ,5,2018-08-19
2136,Two days in the happiest place on earth,what a two days we had it was stinking hot but we made our way around the park with ease the kids had a ball and the wife became one of the kids i hadn t been to disney in yrs but expectations were met great day ,5,2018-08-18
2137,DisneyCrooks,i am definitely going to seek legal retribution refund just won t do it fastpass maxpass what a rip off no mention of only ride every min when spending on these tickets for a family of by pm no more fast pass entries for rides such as space mtn or indiana jones what a rip off most of the rides are the same crap from the s s disney ever hear of lilo stich lion king moana little mermaid madagascar because no sign of anything slightly recent or known by kids born in the past years terrible disappointment and will make a special effort to warn others from wasting their money ,1,2018-08-18
2138,Disney never changes!,we have not been to disneyland for quite sometime and it has not changed much same recycled rides long lines over priced food and pushy parents can t wait to come back in another years cheers ,4,2018-08-18
2139,Wifi is a joke!,obviously any trip to disney is going to be fantastic however do not waste your money and the upgraded fast pass unless you have unlimited data the wifi in the park is sketchy at best it s hard to believe that in disney does not provide free reliable wifi they really need to work on that ,4,2018-08-18
2140,Fantastic,i visited disneyland with my wife and kids aged and we spent days there one in each park we had a great time highlights for us were star tours splash mountain indiana jones and pirates of the carribean in disneyland in california park we loved the grizzly water ride cars awesome goofys sky school and the guardians of the galaxy it was august and it was extremely crowded especially california park with many of the main rides there mins plus wait that said once we worked out how to use the fast passes and became aware of the single rider lines we actually managed to get through most of the main rides in the day first piece of advice get there early the parks are quieter secondly use the fast pass system every hours you can get a fast pass and this is the best way to avoid the queues by mid afternoon it seemed like the most popular ride had run out of fast passes so maybe worth heading to those early at around midday for example the return for cars was pm and at pm the return for guardians of the galaxy was pm use the single rider queue if you can as the queues are much shorter not that much longer than using the fast pass the parades were excellent and the firework display is worth the wait we had a year old with us and didn t think he would last from until so we did til and then went back to our hotel in anaheim and returned around and that worked well for us the shuttles to the car parks are very efficient so it s easy overall we had a great time even with the crowds it is a magical place and whilst it was very intense days with the crowds and the heat we loved it ,5,2018-08-18
2141,The REAL Deal,always love disneyland i grew up in so ca after all things have changed a bit but the spirit of the place is exactly the same ,5,2018-08-18
2142,The happiest place on earth!,we had three days at dl and it was up to the usual high disney standards i would pay the extra to get the fast passes on the phone saves a lot of time and much more efficient than the old style paper fast passes ,5,2018-08-17
2143,So Crowded,my husband and i visited disneyland on a sunday it was so crowded maybe it s less crowded during the week but that s just the way our schedule landed us we got there around am there were lines just to get in line security tickets dining rides and even though we had the fast pass sometimes the ride would be unavailable breakdowns and your time slot disappeared oh well you got to see disneyland once i ll go back to orlando but not anaheim ,3,2018-08-17
2144,"Very well done. Although it was crowded, the staff had everything in command and made sure all were having a good time.",great place for folks with little kids my teens enjoyed it but don t want to go back enjoyed moments with lincoln ,4,2018-08-17
2145,Crowded but we had a good time,took our teen boys for their second visit to disneyland they went when they were very young and didn t remember we arrived about am and park wasn t too crowded then and hit the haunted mansion regular line only about min wait at that time while we waited for our first fast pass big thunder i recommend the extra for the max pass as means you can book your fast passes using your phone without walking around the park to get the physical tickets this saves time and your feet also you get the photopass option included allowing you to download the photos later as a regular to walt disney world i recommend booking at least one table service restaurant well before you go yes they are a bit expensive but it enables you to rest the feet and relax away from the queues and crowds if your kids are a bit older and if you can pace yourself stay until after pm when the fireworks finishes it is much cooler and the queues on the high demand rides drop right off as many people leave between the hours of pm and pm when the park closes we hit about of the really popilar rides including nemos submarine and almost no queues ,4,2018-08-17
2146,Great but be prepared to pay premium for food and drinks,great experience for the kids and adults advisable to get the fast pass per day to maximise and plan your day overall amazing great job disney ,5,2018-08-16
2147,Happy birthday,we went to the park around am summer time in august midweek yes it was crowded but not as bad as i thought it would be during summer break if you go early in the morning the lines are not that long i really suggest to pay additional to get fast pass available on your mobile phone it is worth every single penny we didn t stay in line longer than min we got fast pass we go to the ride you can do it on your phone using disneyland app the app was useful to see real time wait in line we signed up for the jedi lessons early in the morning our son is a big fan of star wars he really liked it i suggest to get a break in the middle of the day maybe return to your hotel for couple of hours we saw two shows parade and fireworks don t miss them ate ice cream which wasn t really expensive the park is clean and we ll maintained it was a very hot day the temperature was in the s but there are lots of shades one day was not enough of course we really enjoyed it ,5,2018-08-16
2148,Disneyland,disneyland is just how you would except it to be characters all around the park and lots of rides while at the park we ran into three rides that weren t working properly as a person who doesn t love rides it was an okay place to visit the food could use some help ,4,2018-08-16
2149,The original magical place,our first trip to disneyland anaheim but we have done wdw and paris we love disney and really wanted to have a magical experience which it was mostly there are some great classic rides here and a good variety for all ages yes there are big queues but if you pay extra to get fastpass plus maxpass and also head in for the extra magic hour then you can do all the rides easily in one day disney parks require you to be super organised and to plan ahead if you want to just wander around then you will need a couple of days to explore everything in each park i have to agree with other reviewers that the customer service is not up to disney s usual standards in wdw when there were problems with long queues or broken rides then free fast passes were issued quickly also when our magic bands didn t work for paying for food we got free meals in one shop they even gave us a free t shirt as they didn t have the size we needed and had to order it at disneyland park i was trying to buy a toy story ball and asked multiple caste members were i could get them but didn t get any helpful response i don t understand why they just couldn t check on the system and then request one to be sent to our hotel anyway we loved the park despite it being incredibly busy and did have a magical experience yes it s expensive but overall the disney brand does stand for great quality as mentioned it just needs to work on the customer service ,4,2018-08-16
2150,The original. Brilliant day because of Maxpass.,we loved disneyland each of the rides seemed that little bit better than orlando my husband especially enjoyed the indiana jones wide which we had never experienced before the maxpass was a sound investment allowing us to continually book extra rides on our phone whilst in the queue for another we did all the mountains before midday and even rose on separate rides before am top tip if you don t have extra magic hours go to the other park get in the queue from am for am opening between bags search tickets and opening that way you should get a few good rides before am ,5,2018-08-16
2151,Amazing,first time i have been to disneyland in america anaheim what a truly amazing place somewhere where you can be a kid again with no one looking down on you to see grown adults wearing mickey mouse ears and t shirts is so good my kids loved both days that we were there the only downside for me is the cost of eating in some of the restaurants i will definitely be going again i m over and live the place my kids ages are and both loved it as much as me and the wife ,5,2018-08-15
2152,an experience of people,it s a very busy place people told me to be prepared for it but that didnt register until i got there we went in august and boy it was hot we went first thing in the morning and the times are just ridiculous with no shade best time would be in the afternoon but i found the fast pass selection can we scares i did find that the later you buy the leas rides available which sucked when you paid and could only go on rides such a la it s a small world and buzz lightyear i wont rush back and i wont tell people to go ,3,2018-08-15
2153,Disneyland a Great place to take the family,there is so many things to see and do make sure if you are a veteran or retired from the military to take advantage of the discount park tickets also to not end up spending all your money on water bottles at or each the counter service gives medium size cups of ice water for free the best tip for going to disneyland with teenagers is to take away their cellphones while they are in the park or you may end up with them just finding a corner to sit in and text there friends or playing games on the internet they can do that anytime,5,2018-08-15
2154,Really the happiest place in Anaheim,we visited august th for my daughter s birthday lines to get through security was long but was re assuring to know that disneyland was thoroughly going through people s bags to make us all secure i did not mind the wait the kids had a great time with the various rides appropriate for their ages there was lots of characters all around and lines were not as long as disneyworld we loved the firework light laser show at pm ,5,2018-08-15
2155,Amazing place,spent days at disneyland our first ever visit travelled from australia it had been a dream of mine to visit disneyland as a child my yr old son had an amazing time there great memories were made its such a magical place hoping to take my grandson there one day so much to see and do,5,2018-08-15
2156,Disneyland is great! Service is below par!,about every six months i go to my one of my favorite places in the world disneyland on my previous visit i wrote a review stating that disneyland was slipping in regards to customer service and cleanliness this time i went to try to prove myself wrong and to give the happiest place on earth a more positive review i went alone this time it is definitely easier to maneuver this park when you go solo however it was not as fun but the magic was still there being a single rider it was easier to get to the front of the line for most of the big rides the fast pass system was also easier to maneuver as a single rider the line attendants seemed a little more polite when they discovered i was by myself and a couple of them actually offered where i could find the single rider lines i arrived at the park very early and was able to go on all the major rides within the first couple of hours having some extra time i actually did some reconnaissance work just going around the park and observing how the cast members were in regards to service particularly in the food and shopping areas not really needing anything i politely went up to some cast members most of which to be older kids working there for the summer and ask them questions about where i could find this and or that disney items i could ve been a corporate inspector for all they knew i m a well groomed educated professional in shape middle aged man dressed in a nice polo shirt and cargo shorts although i approach them smiling and being extremely polite and respectful no smiles were returned to me by the cast members it even came across to me like i was bothering them even though they were not busy assisting other park goers one particular instance was when i went up to a slushy vendor young man i approached him smiled asked for a lemonade slushy no smile back from him and his exact response machine is broken i then asked him politely will the machine be fixed soon his response no clue now i didn t really need a slushy but when i saw this vendor standing there with a sour look on his face before i even approached him i thought it would be a good experiment to see how this obviously unhappy cast member would respond to a day paying park guest i really need to renew my annual pass another instance was when a cast member young woman actually use her index finger alone to point something out for me cast members are required to point with two or more fingers her verbal response it s over there somewhere again no smile no may i help you obviously she didn t study the park map in her training i ll have to admit the parade attendant cast members have a tough job with crowd control because they are on a time constraint however they could do their job without shouting at people another thing i observed and heard now some of these are things i could overlook however this is disneyland not walmart being a veteran of the disneyland parks i expect a little more polite response from the cast members especially when i went up to them purposely with a very respectful and polite attitude again i was doing reconnaissance work in no rush observing if the customer service has improved in the park the older cast members seem to follow the disney brand guidelines more than the younger cast members i was delighted that the park was cleaner due to it being summer the park was running at full capacity which is good for the high attendance word of advice if your group is ok with being separated on rides definitely use the single rider lines for the attractions that offer them definitely buy the max pass to book your fast passes on your phone for better customer service try to hunt out the cast members who appear to be part of the baby boomer or generation x generations ages most of these cast members work there because they want to don t expect too much from the millennial generation cast members come on disney i m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt because i love going there but you really need to beef up the customer service training of your cast members i know i know who wants to work there butt off in the hot sun for minimum wage certainly no older teenaged kid does these days i ll be back disney around the holidays i really want to give you a great review a long time and loyal disney park fan ,4,2018-08-14
2157,I love Disneyland!!!!,we love this place so much we want to stay forever we love the haunted mansion ride it feels like we re close to our relatives aside from the spook fest we fill our hungry bellies with beignets yum ,5,2018-08-14
2158,Not sure Disney get the customer service thing anymore,having been to disneyworld florida and france i was expecting the original site to be amazing but it s like it has been left behind in the s poor selection of rides very few suitable for anyone over the queues were shocking hours upwards and the local kids are back at school to park the car on top of the entry fee seriously disney is that anyway to treat the people that pay your wages two of the big rides were broken no shade whilst queueing and the queues for some rides spilled out onto the main concourses and blocked the way this was poor management talking of which i saw lots of young kids running the queues and serving but no management at all as a result the queues were poorly managed and created a few angry exchanges i noticed they simply let in too many people for the size of park it s greed and couldn t be bothered to have the key rides working in the height of the summer we would have been out and done by pm but we had to queue so long please save your money and don t give it to these money grabbers or go to florida where they know how to organise a park ,1,2018-08-14
2159,There’s nowhere like it!,our th visit to a disney park and first to california certainly smaller than florida cinderella s castle is teeny in comparison but just as good get there early obvs everyone says this but it is worst getting out of bed early and make best use of the fastpass system you can only have one at a time but it does give you opportunity to get a new one every hours so plan it carefully don t bother using it for the lines under mins use it for the big boys like splash mountain which otherwise have queues of up to mins queuing is part of disney and love it or loathe it you just have to do food on park is expensive and not great we ended up looking for salads and best one we had was at new orleans s square we did the park in days that is enough plus did two days in california adventure which has better rides ,5,2018-08-13
2160,Get there early,we arrived prior to opening and rode all of the major rides except fantasyland i didn t have little ones in the morning try the beignets in orleans square they were a yummy snack ,5,2018-08-13
2161,I could live here.,i mean i couldn t afford to live here but if i win a billion dollars i d like to say i d do something altruistic but i d probably just live here ,5,2018-08-13
2162,Disneyland!,what can you say about disneyland even as an adult it s amazing the food is good the rides are fun it s clean just crowded and expensive,4,2018-08-13
2163,A fading beauty,i ve been visiting disneyland for over years and whilst the magic is still there it is a little behind the times in terms of organisation the lack of park wide wi fi is a real drag some of the rides such as the ancient indiana jones should have been retired years ago and as usual very crowded but the shows and parades are still magical and the fireworks light show was awesome ,3,2018-08-12
2164,Family vacay,the best place so clean everyone is nice love extra magic hours fast pass system run well something for everyone,5,2018-08-12
2165,Fun!!,lots of great rides expensive but worth it the evening show was great wish we could go when it was less crowded but still got to see everything we wanted to just a long hot day ,5,2018-08-12
2166,Incredible,having been a lover of disney all my life it was a dream come true to go to disneyland the park was amazing and very clean we went off peak which meant we would miss out on a ride or two as they undergo routine maintenance the ride we missed out on happened to be splash mountain needless to say we will return to take on the mountain in the future ,5,2018-08-12
2167,Family fun day,disneyland is an attraction full theme park it is suitable for all age groups not only children the attractions are variable from rides to showcases to live shows and parades get a fastpass to allow you skip some of the long lines,5,2018-08-12
2168,Magical experience,amazing place for everyone in the family i really loved the virtual reality rides like d there were many rides for teens also many shows were going on to keep everyone entertained the management is great in the sense that there was no chaos even though it was the peak time when we traveled and restaurants gave plenty of ice cold water for free for the hot days of august staff is amazing and friendly food inside the park is expensive but you can bring your own food from outside in the park the parade was just magical overall a magical experience ,5,2018-08-12
2169,Disneyland - perfect vacay!,our family of met up with our extended family and we just can t get enough of this park we like it better than disneyworld even though we were there during off peak season it was pretty crowded so i can t imagine how crowded it will get during peak season still worth going ,5,2018-08-11
2170,A dream come through for foreign children,while i was unwillingly dragged to the park i detest crowds and team parks in general i must admit disneyland park is well done it is organizes friendly and efficient the landscape is beautifully done and well maintained we stayed at one of the large nearby resort hotels which made it relatively painless to get to and from the park the california adventure part with the san francisco section and the norther california wine bar were very nice we had both dinner and lunch in this area and the food was surprisingly good for foreign children disneyland is a dream come through ,5,2018-08-11
2171,Its the original park built by walt himself,very busy park really popular with smaller kids great place just to wander around or hit the rides fireworks are amazing ,5,2018-08-11
2172,Trashiest place on earth,i honestly don t know what disneyland is it s not really a theme park since there are hardly any rides the rides are equivalent to a county fair it s just one big souvenir shop with a few county fair rides thrown in no one is happy here kids don t like it adults don t like it there is nothing to do but buy souvenirs seriously six flags had more exciting things to standing in traffic is more exciting than disneyland don t fall into the trap like us disney is not fun it s old fashioned it s crowded you wait in line for over an hour even with max pass for a boring min ride then you walk another miles to wait another mins to ride another lame ride the only people who say this place is fun are the type of people who enjoy paying hundreds of dollars for admission to buy coffee mugs and t shirts that have mickey mouse or other disney characters on them also i didn t even see mickey mouse or any popular characters and if you happen to see a character they only stay by the idiots disney hires to take pictures to sell back to you such a scam ,1,2018-08-11
2173,Max Pass A MUST!! Save time in line!,download the disneyland app and purchase the tickets with the max pass option it s super convenient to choose your fast pass via your cell phone we only waited between to minutes with the fast pass the entire days we were at disneyland and disney california well worth the extra per ticket to get the max pass without the fast pass wait time ranged from to minutes we were there august to ,5,2018-08-10
2174,Family Vacation,i love the new app which includes fast pass photos and restaurant reservations the fast pass was a huge time saver ,4,2018-08-10
2175,Can't imagine we're here!,i love all the stuff in disney include the turkey leg the pixar parade is good fantasmic is the best and the firework was so beautiful but crowded ,5,2018-08-10
2176,Solo couple visit - not sure it was worth it,we vere in la the final days of our week us vacarion except shopping and beach la has little to offer so we decided to go into childhood and pay a visit to disney park parking was exceptional and very organised promising it was an ok experience but i must admit i find disney park paris much better maybe it is just me but the park seemed small in comparison little shade offered throughout the park seems ice cream is not a thing in us we found one place it was sold and then only on stick in a very limited selection tried to purchase the fast track option after having tried to stand in line for min usd is a fair price for that but it turns out you need to book a time as well so you can get a fast track between and pm forexample this was at pm so you need to criss cross the park if any fast track is available for the various rides there was a difference between the fast track in the app and in the machines on site the app hardly gave any fast track options or they were very late download the app btw it was a good help in finding restrooms and see the waiting time for the rides etc we saw characters during the hrs we were there which is too little if u have kids this time we didn t smoking area are you kidding me overall it was a day spend wouldn t say it was well spend but what is the alternative in this boring city i think their resort looks ok it is definitely worth considering we stayed at shangri la st monica which is not really worth it at k usd for nights will try the disney resort next time ,3,2018-08-10
2177,Never disappoints,we spent one day in each park long days of hours and while tired at the end it was worth it the surprise was how short the lines were at the main park as compared to california adventure the parks seemed crowded too maybe it gets more crowded the most wait time for a ride was mins which is nothing compared to the ridiculous lines at universal thank goodness for the ingenuity of fastpass our favourite out of the two parks was california adventure there were more interesting rides and food although the nostalgia and tradition is higher at the main park another surprise was the size of the castle it is miniature compared to florida or paris that definitely didn t have the wow factor as you walk down from main street not to miss rides are radiator springs in carsland soaring pirates of caribbean and thunder mountain our son loved incredicoaster a great tip is to use the single rider program so you barely have to wait and use fastpass the food was ok it is what you d expect at amusement parks my kids are fine with typical kids food and it s priced well at under which included drinks and sides we did have one great dish at the new orleans french market and that was the beef stew inside a sourdough bread bowl even though this would normally be eaten during colder weather not during a heatwave it was very good we had the salad at flo s diner and that was uninspiring and pasta at another place which seemed mushy oh well we enjoyed pixar parade at night much more than the fireworks oh and the frozen show was great a very nice break from the heat and well put together ,5,2018-08-10
2178,Fantastic family park,bring lots of money if you want some of their great souvenirs food is not cheap either but there is a wide range get to the park at opening or buy a fast pass or else you line up for over mins sometimes ,5,2018-08-10
2179,Love Disneyland,i ve been to disneyland a bazillion times but went recently with out of town guests i can t stress enough go on a weekday it s cheaper and the lines are shorter also be aware you cannot have fast passes within a hour window of each other so bummed about that ,4,2018-08-09
2180,Pretty good - not as good as WDW though.,we wanted to see the original and we did it is not nearly as good as wdw no magic bands surly employees oppressive crowds unwieldy fast pass system just wasn t the typical disney experience we are used to it certainly wasn t a bad time at all just not the same ,4,2018-08-09
2181,Batter than Orlando,we had been to magic kingdom a couple of weeks prior and been very disappointed see separate review wanted to cancel disneyland however realised tickets were non refundable weather was better in anaheim which helped cast members seemed happier than counterparts in orlando really enjoyed having park hopper ticket and being able to hop between the two parks loved the rides at california adventure wifi does not work in either disney so we had to spend a fortune on international data roaming to use app crowds were horrific glad we went but won t rush back ,4,2018-08-09
2182,"Less ""Disney"" than ever - Is it so hard to have Mickey, Minnie, Donald and crew readily available???",we had a memorable day for sure know what to expect regarding cost lines and have a plan etc not much in the way of traditional disney characters or themes rides events i am not saying there is none of that just that it is far more limited than one might think they are far more interested in pushing every other franchise they ve acquired pixar marvel etc and or destroyed star wars than traditional disney fun the fact is disneyland has become much more of a generic theme park with just a slice of disney ,3,2018-08-09
2183,Best place to visit. It’s where the magic started.,love disneyland best theme park in the world walt disney s charm is still in the park and attention to detail is everywhere ,5,2018-08-08
2184,Love Disney,i love disneyland so much it has always been a place that brings magic to my heart and soul i was grateful to be able to go with family this year ,5,2018-08-08
2185,Cleanest amusement park I've ever been to,i don t think i ve ever been to an amusement park that is so clean given the amount of traffic disneyland gets i think this is often overlooked and needs to be acknowledged the custodial staff are amazing lots of plentiful clean air conditioned washrooms really makes a difference ,5,2018-08-08
2186,"Ok, but not great!",if you have been to disney world this is a disappointment rides constantly were broke down lines were,3,2018-08-08
2187,Disneyland more like QueueLand… Once in a lifetime for me – and I don't mean that in a good way!,first bit of advice book online otherwise you ll be stuck in a queue to drive into the carpark you ll be stuck in a queue to get on the tram to the ticket booths you ll be stuck in another queue to get tickets then another queue to get into the park itself not to mention the horrific queues to the rides some over hours long just to do a ride that takes minutes so booking online means well one less queue next bit of advice get there early though it that could actually mean a toss up between being stuck in the la traffic and being stuck in the queue into the disneyland carpark ok that s enough of the queues they really do ruin the experience for me though on the disabled access front it s all very accessible there s disabled parking be sure to verbally communicate to the parking staff that you have a blue badge they will recognise this there otherwise you ll just be waved to normal parking there s an accessible tram from the carpark to the actual park itself but there s also an accessible bus option mickey bus instead of the tram it s level all around the park itself in terms of access to the rides for wheelchair scooter users here s the deal you can book a return time this means you go to the ride you want to do and you organise a time when you ll come back and do it which is comparable to the time you would have spent in the queue you can only have one return time active at any one time we didn t realise this and went to book a return time on another ride and was then told that was how it worked by this point we d been in the park hours and not actually been on a ride so i went slightly ballistic saying something like this was the worst place i d ever been to in my life and the woman very kindly gave us a few fast passes which give you access to the rides via the exit that was very nice of her she also let us onto the ride she was on which was the peter pan ride which was way too tame for my and year old but at least we had got on something we then used a fast pass to get on matterhorn bobsleds now i have a disability which means my neck isn t the greatest and this ride was a bone shaker and i couldn t wait to get off it i m sure it would be fun if you didn t have any bone issues but it was very much an old jolting rollercoaster space mountain was a more modern rollercoaster and i had something to lean my head neck on so that was much better and great fun in fact my children did that one times pirates of the carribean was ok we d booked a return time i wouldn t say it was worth a hour wait the boys enjoyed riding cars in autopia which we went on as it had the shortest queue and that was the sum total of rides we went on during a hour visit at a cost of each plus for parking plus for one slice of pizza in a horrible restaurant i ll leave you to decide that makes it good value for money but personally it one in a lifetime stuff not because it was amazing but more because we sort of felt we should take the kids later in the holiday we found ourselves on the beach boardwalk in santa cruz for an all day pass to all the rides virtually no queues for anything and some thrilling rides my son went on rides in less than hours there crazy by comparison make sure you take water bottles can be refilled for free at fountains sun cream and have an ice cream in the parlour probably the highlight of my day apart from the idea of never having to go there again ,2,2018-08-08
2188,do not go to disneyland,went to disneyland to enjoy instead went to jail because we had a small argument because someone called for security do not go there they will rip you off with food toys do your research people die in disneyland i m never coming back to disneyland,1,2018-08-08
2189,Closed rides,disappointing we got to the park early they let us in main street only unfortunately all the stores were not opened yet would have done some early browsing or buying before they let us in the main park we went to pirate s first then to haunted mansion it was closed then we went to thunder mtn it was closed so we doubled back went to star wars launchpad closed til am so we ended up waiting minutes for buzz lightyear space blasters i think they call it all the lines were mins plus waiting time oh well disappointed ,3,2018-08-08
2190,Outstanding fun!,the rides were especially fun i got a park hopper ticket and hotel package from a big box store and thought the price was good this is an excellent place to visit whether you are with family or going solo so much to see and do i thought it was worth the money ,5,2018-08-08
2191,Good Times,what can you say about disneyland that hasn t already been said if you enjoy disney you ll love disneyland in the summer heat though make sure to stay at a hotel that doesn t take too long to get to because it s worth it to either stay at your hotel for a few hours and go later in the day so that you re in the park at night when it s cooler or take a break in the middle of your day and go back to your hotel to cool off then you can eat out of the park and save some money as well ,5,2018-08-08
2192,A dream come true.,i had always wanted to go to disneyland ever since i was a child i was so happy to have my photo taken in front of walt disney s statue my wife and i went on all the rides that we had seen on tv and could only dream about ,5,2018-08-08
2193,Ah Disney,made our return to disneyland after three years away it s always a good experience overall yes it s expensive yes it s crowded yes you will wait in line it s disney not a fast food restaurant my major complaint isn t about the park but rather the behavior of some of the guests this park is targeted towards families with young children the last thing i want to see is two lanky teenagers sucking each other s faces in line or a group of teens talking about their various physical escapades and since when did the f word become part of normal speech people people people please learn to behave a little better around small children ,4,2018-08-08
2194,Not like the old days!,always fun but so crowded you can hardly move only got to go on rides because of the long lines not really thaat fun in the heat and with the crowds ,3,2018-08-08
2195,Lost its magic,i was super excited to go to disneyland max pass makes is worth the extra dollars we went on every major ride even if it was late monday s are by the the crowdest skip the fireworks the hurd you in and out like cattle and there is no place to sit the cast members can be rude the food was just ok ,3,2018-08-08
2196,The original oark,we came early opened at am we arrived at am they let you into main st long before am did most of the main rides by am so we could relax for the rest of the day got the fast pass via the app for each the moment we stepped into the park you are mad iffy over do not as you get fast passes to most rides without the need to queue plus your picture are all stored in tv same place of talking them with characters i ve been to disneyworld times and this is a slightly smaller version of magic kingdom although by no means small a lot of the same rides are shards we liked going on all the classic rides for more thrills we will go to californialand park in a few days spend the day here and see the parade at pm as well take some food in if you can plus drinks it s going to be a potentially vert very busy day ,5,2018-08-08
2197,"Great for kids, great for adults",i ve been to disneyland many times and every time i go i am amazed at what is has to offer my favorite ride will always be pirates of the caribbean also splash mountain is awesome too ,5,2018-08-07
2198,Nice park,when we entered the park because we are annual pass holders we had the right to go to the park hour early but to have breakfast we had to call up and to make a reservation the attraction at disneyland park not california adventure were excellent the employees were nice and friendly specially when one wears a birthday badge for some reason you feel like a kid again and that was walt disney s message for an adult to feel like a kid again i am sorry but i do not reveal my birthday nor my age ,5,2018-08-07
2199,Overrated,this is such a disappointment when compared to disneyworld it s much smaller and is more packed in the lines where crazy and there is dead ends every where there the castle looks petite compared to orlando would not recommend or go again go to florida instead you won t be disappointed ,2,2018-08-07
2200,Disnet,great time always only problem is with new photos on tickets make entrance line very long on monday morning,5,2018-08-07
2201,Still a Classic!,even with all the newly added things here and there over the years disneyland still can t be beat in visiting over other non disney parks it is wonderful but don t go on the weekend don t go on a holiday don t go in the summer research the off times and go then you re welcome get the max pass worth every penny and bring snacks cooler with you for everything except maybe dinner see mickey minnie st if that is on your list and ride peter pan either first thing or late at night no fast pass available for that ride and it is a must ,5,2018-08-07
2202,fun loving place,a place you can come back in time and enjoy life with no grownup ideas i wish i could spend at least days a year in that place ,5,2018-08-07
2203,Holiday,what a magical experience loved every minute of our visit staff were so friendly helpful and really attentive they had times when they had to be assertive like at the parades and fireworks but this was done in a very positive manner keep up good work ,5,2018-08-07
2204,As expected,been to one been to all get s a bit boring after a while but i suppose you have to do what the kids say you got to do ,4,2018-08-07
2205,Nice one day for kids and adults,with two kids of and years old we spent the whole day until pm in the park it is all in a place the kids make their big eyes to all games and play you d better book the ticket online to avoid crowd ,4,2018-08-07
2206,Love it.,we took our first trip to disneyland this past august we were there when i opened on a day that the other park had extra magic hours and the crowds were low enough that you could get onto a number of rides quickly three rides were experiencing technical issues which was annoying the park is clean interesting and well maintained ,4,2018-08-07
2207,The happiest place,not much to say its disneyland they got it figured out i must say their kennel is excellent and the staff are good people that enjoy working there ,5,2018-08-07
2208,Truly magical,we visited disneyland for the first time after years of dreaming we were not sure how it would live up to such high expectations but somehow it exceeded every one the cast members were all very courteous bubbly helpful and made the experience that much better beforehand we did a lot of research on tips and tricks which really paid off if you are going make sure to do the following to get the most out of your day download the disneyland app and load your tickets onto it this app allowed us to download all of our max pass photos instantaneously view and reserve fast passes for the whole day mobile order food and check wait times all over the park because of this app we skipped every single line that day buy the max pass with your ticket this lets you use fast passes on your phone and gives you unlimited professional photo ops all throughout the park totally worth the go early because on certain days they open up the park before the scheduled time overall it was a fabulous experience with nice cast members no lines great food and lots of fun as for food recommendations the dole whip mickey ice cream and plaza inn fried chicken dinner were all excellent also be sure to visit downtown disney but keep in mind that the shopping options are much greater once you actually enter the park ,5,2018-08-06
2209,Disney Magic,there s always magic for the little ones and adults alike when visiting mickey minnie and friends there are so many blog posts and reviews about disney that it could be overwhelming sometimes the approach our family took was to visit the rides we felt were priority mainly driven by the interest of our little one and would be too hot to wait in the hot sun early on in the morning upon arrival e g autopia of course picking up fast passes especially for the fantasmic show was a must we spent some money on the character breakfast one day and it was worth it we took the advice of many and made reservations for mid morning so that we could take a break mid way through the day and have it serve as brunch while visiting all the characters in one place everyone s preferences are different so do what will make your family enjoy this magical place the most ,4,2018-08-06
2210,DREAM COME TRUE,it s what everyone say about disney so what more can i say however traveling from australia we were not sure of what to expect and all we had been told about was the crowds and they where right however my one piece of advise is to spend the money on the fast track it was well worth the money and it helped plan your day you cannot fast track every ride at once but you can fast track a second ride at a time after a certain point for example if you fast tracked one ride at am for am you could not fast track a second ride until say the other thing we found a bit testing was the lack of variety of food available it was all hotdogs hamburgers fries and that type of fast food although we did find one stall selling fresh fruit and fruit salad but that was the only one also you can buy a photo package which includes all the photos taken in the park including the rides and the guys and girls who walk around asking if you want your photo taken well worth it as they add a few extras like them telling you to put your hand out and when the photo is taken they superimpose an image of tinkerbell or you holding balloons etc they took some great photos for us you need to have at least two days and nights and there are two shows at night but yi our can only get to them one at a time as they are only a few minutes apart again well worth it and get their early to get a good spot ,4,2018-08-06
2211,Disneyland still rocks,my last visit to disneyland was years ago it has expanded dramatically took the grandkids and everyone had a blast the light show at pm on the river was amazing ate at several restaurants and all the meals were good prepare for long waits at the rides and load up your wallet purse,5,2018-08-06
2212,"Too hot, too crowded, too expensive and long lines",i went to disneyland in when it opened in i have been there a hundred times i have worked there i would recommend it for very young children only i took my grand kids of course they liked it i suffered through it once is more than enough ,2,2018-08-06
2213,Family holiday,going only morning until about but you motel have lunch had a swim relax go back around for reducing end and spend the night when its a little cooler the best thing we did was the upgrade to fast pass for a day person ,5,2018-08-06
2214,"Me and wife are passholders so, keep that in mind before your opinions. Obviously Disney fans.",we love the parks staff is always helpful and kind very rarely do we run into issues parking is even controlled to show you disney s dedication to the experience from park entry to park exit now there are some cons trams have been increasingly difficult and that s due to starwars land being built it s temporary but expect to wait to get into disney and friends and to leave back downtown has the best food options in my view if you try to eat in the park at a sit down it will be tough unless you book in advance hope this helps and download the disney app ,5,2018-08-06
2215,My happy place!,what can i say about disneyland it really is the happiest place on earth the parks are clean and efficiently run plenty of workers around to assist with any needs and there s rides shows character meet and greets and food galore i highly recommend getting at least a day pass park hopper and it s totally worth the extra money to buy the max pass for only a day more you can save all your park photos and select fast pass rides on your app the park has free wifi to use the app so it s perfect even for people travelling without cell service or data on their phones the wifi can be spotty in some areas but not to the point it hinders your experience check out the many disney blogs online for the best tips and tricks for the park our favourite rides are guardians of the galaxy the old tower of terror the incredi coaster the old california screaming ,5,2018-08-06
2216,I love this place,enjoyed a nice hot vacation here this year it s my favorite place to be used a maxpass the last day and vowed to use this everyday next trip saves on the travel back and forth trying to get fastpasses for your favorite rides i suggest you get it ,5,2018-08-06
2217,"Amazing Park, but only one problem",i m a huge disney fan so going to disneyland was a must on my california trip the park was clean but very crowded my busy guess is it was so crowded because it was pixar fest my favorite ride was the guardians of the galaxy ride in california adventure park my only problem was that i had gotten injured on early on on my trip to california i tried to talk guest relations to see if they could make any accommodations for me but was told i need proof from a medical professional in order for them to make any accommodation as i am not from the area i had no way to see a doctor to get said proof i m glad i had fast pass on my ticket so that way i didn t have to wait in too many long lines but i still ended up being in pain by the end of the day my advice try not to get injured while on vacation to avoid this headache,4,2018-08-06
2218,Truly the happiest place on earth,the greatest place to find entertainment food and to just get away from the every day i highly recommend becoming an annual pass holder it is expensive up front but in the long run the benefits outweigh the costs if you go at least once a month ,5,2018-08-06
2219,It's the original family fun park.,disney has been described as the happiest place on earth i think orlando florida may be more impressive but the park in anaheim is the original yes waiting in line is a drag but the connection to films and current entertainment has helped to modernize what was already a classic product i am not a big fan or waiting in line but its great for family and friends and even though you no longer get in free on your birthday its still some place everyone should go at least once ,4,2018-08-06
2220,Great day,wife got to live out her childhood dream when we went to disneyland parks to enter and all the disney stuff tou would think it to be if able to get the fast track passes as the lines are massive got out fairly quick after the fireworks considering the amount of people,5,2018-08-06
2221,Disney fun,too many shops selling the same stuff not impressed by it the mono rail is very quick not like the relaxing way it used to be disney world much better,3,2018-08-06
2222,Absolute fun!,wife and i met up with an old childhood friend and his two kids i grew up in southern california and always came to disneyland with this friend first time back since needless to say that we both acted like a couple of kids again park is nicely landscaped kept up attractions took no time to get on at all all the magic experienced as a kid came flooding back and that s what walt wanted for us all ,5,2018-08-06
2223,It's Disney,so yes expect lines everywhere and to pay for that happiest place on earth feel if you can t get past that or the price you will not have fun yes it goes up every year eat outside of the park when possible that includes downtown disney to save money ,4,2018-08-06
2224,Many better things to do in the area,my family spent one day in the park and in the whole scope of our day trip to california disneyland was easily the one thing we all said we wished we hadn t done it is incredibly crowded unbelievably overpriced and uninteresting to say the least what they did right the park is unbelievably clean with this many people i d have expected it to be a mess but honestly it was clean everywhere kudos to the maintenance staff the parking and the tram to the park were very easy to use other than the fact that the parking ramp isn t marked very well so it s easy to get turned around the tram ride was comfortable and fast what they did wrong the lines for the rides were ridiculous and very deceptive we d walk to a ride and see not many people standing by it get in line and suddenly the line would turn a corner or go inside a building and there would be people in front of you we were there for six hours and rode exactly four rides you better be in your seat an hour and a half ahead of time for the fireworks display if not baton waving teenagers will herd you around and around sending you in different directions while the show is going on this one really pissed me off i wanted a picture of me with my family with the castle and the fireworks in the background we finally found someone willing to take our picture another visitor and just as we were getting ready some knucklehead employee starts waving his baton at us and shouting at us to keep it moving or leave the park no picture we left the park never to return we downloaded the disneyland app which has a section on it for disney photos you know the ones they take of you just as you are screaming down a ride after coaxing my y o daughter to finally go on a big ride we went to check out the photos the look on my daughter s face in the picture was priceless and we all had a great laugh about it i wanted to buy the picture so i went to the photo booth near the ride and asked to buy it the employees both told me that the picture would be available on the app in a matter of minutes so there was no need to buy it unless i wanted them to print it out i decided that i could print it on my own and they both assured me that was the best way to do it we went on our way and later when i went back on to the app to see the picture it wasn t there so now we have no picture when someone wants to spend money at your business it makes sense to let them spend it not talk them out of it dumb i could go on and on about how commercialized the place is everything is for sale and nothing is cheap and the rides aren t exciting if you want rides go to knott s berry farm or six flags ,2,2018-08-06
2225,Magical,went with a friend and had so much fun as any other disney park awesome cast members and entertainment the only thing is that some characters don t have a line to meet them so they decide when is your turn for pictures even if you arrived first ,4,2018-08-05
2226,Best place evr,truly magical best experience ever great place for people of all ages love the castle food not too great and overpriced but you can get past that as the place itself is amazing whole family enjoyed,5,2018-08-05
2227,"Fast Pass is Free for All, Make use if it!",we are a family of with a year old son and have never really fancied disney but felt obliged to visit as part of our california trip we got a day park hopper which allowed us to switch between the parks disneyland and california adventures which are literally seconds from each other either side of the main plaza days was about right to visit everything we wanted to and the park hopper was good because we spent more time in disneyland i must say as first timers we were really impressed by the whole experience the experience is immersive with constant music acts and staff in uniform and character everything is themed the attention to detail is like nothing in the uk it doesn t feel like you re in a theme park it feels like you re in disneyland the quality of rides is superb each tide has a story within a ride something at every turn it s constant make use of the fast pass free to use with your park tickets i believe takes a bit of planning but saves long wait times we used a couple of fast passes each day and it worked really well we got to the park early went straight to a popular ride and obtained our fast pass for later in the day we then got in line for another popular ride while the lines were short that s two rides boxed off with little queuing on both days we managed rides in the first hours ,5,2018-08-05
2228,Magic!,we visited disneyland with our young children initially i was quite surprised at how expensive the tickets were however after spending hours at the park my advice get there after pm if you can t handle the heat i really felt like we got our money s worth the quality of rides and the experience alone outweighs any other parks we ve visited the finale show was truly magical incredible really for the kids a priceless experience bringing the whole magic of disney to life for them thank you ,5,2018-08-04
2229,Life or death,we would never go to disney again certainly never in anaheim my year year old daughter was nearly thrown from the new incredibles roller coaster only last week the safety bar came lose and undone during the ride luckily she had the sense to pull it back into position and locked just before it did the twist ,1,2018-08-03
2230,Budget for the MaxPass!!!,make the maxpass part of your disney budget this is per person per day and worth every penny we had a day park hopper and was able to get on all of our must see rides with the maxpass with no issues we waited on average on mins with the standby time would be mins with this pass you also get unlimited pictures with the disney photographers onsite who will take your family pictures in front of awesome landmarks forget the selfie and get this pass when you get pictures make sure to ask for the magic moment and the team will have you pose to then include a disney character in your picture yes please the rides are fun the entertainment is awesome ans our family had a blast other tips bring a backpack with water and snacks we also brought lollipops for our girls when they started asking too many questions wear sneakers start early and get maxpasses asap would recommend getting a maxpass for the latest ride and then wait to get a pass for the next earliest time the maxpass will fill up so be strategic use the photopass hard card to scan instead of your phones to save your phone s battery see one of our magic moments below have fun ,5,2018-08-03
2231,Disneyland trip,really enjoyed out visit as regular visitors to wdw we enjoyed the differences between the resorts and in many instances preferred disneyland,5,2018-08-03
2232,Annual Pass Holders ride Casey's Circus Train in Fantasyland,the disneyland app on our phone is quite informative but not always accurate on a busy summer evening we chose to ride casey s jr train in fantasyland because the app said it had a minute wait time our wait was minutes but it is a fun ride for all ages the pixar dance party at the tomorrowland stage was the happiest place full of some great dance moves and people watching a new parking structure is being built in addition to star wars land due to open in as annual pass holders for years in a row we are needing to decide whether to renew but it s been a great place to walk and people watch in the evening even if we don t ride anything ,4,2018-08-03
2233,Had to be done,can tell its the oldest bit dated best ride is space mountain even castle is smaller then florida didnt see any characters wondering around also ,3,2018-08-03
2234,My Happy Place,we have been to wdw many times this was our first visit to disneyland i was a bit nervous with the way the park fast passes work we utilized the maxpass on the disneyland app it was awesome we were able to get on all of teh rides we wanted to do disneyland was so relaxing and enjoyable more so that wdw we are retuning next june ,5,2018-08-03
2235,Awesome place of happiness for young kids,disneyland park is a great place for kids anywhere from four to years old with the grandparents and great grandparents getting their greatest joy watching their grandkids and parents getting great joy watching their kids i ve been here many times over the past years it continues to get better with all the advances in technology animation and manufacturing improving the eny tertainment quality becomes easier however the expectations of the guests also become higher waiting in line for most of the rides and other entertainment offerings is a pain so learn how to utilize book your fast passes the park is clean and well maintained the main hindrance to enjoying the entertainment facilities to the fullest is the large crowds food in the park is on the expensive side as are all the souvenirs there are many similarities between disneyland park in anaheim california and the magic kingdom disneyworld orlando florida both are amazingly great but more people tend to go the disneyworld as it offers four great disney entertainment theme parks whereas disneyland has two the other is disney california adventure park also located in anaheim both parks have a large parade of disney floats and characters i noticed that kids enjoy waving to the disney characters ,5,2018-08-02
2236,It is truly THE happiest place on earth!,we had days passes used their disneyland app on our phones the app was convoluting initially with scanning the tickets payment details fast passes purchasing etc however we were able to use the app with ease on the second day found it to be very convenient especially with the map of various rides their waiting time uploaded official photos of rides if you stay at disneyland approved hotels you have an extra hour am before the general public admission all you required were your hotel room keys as prove in addition you have to check with the hotel which disneyland allow the extra hour because they alternate we took the early hour opportunity with the non fast pass eg carrousel the popular eg indiana jones rides be prepared to do a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes we went during summer so sunscreens hat sunglasses hand sanitiser wet wipes were all incredibly useful aside from the rides there were so much to see do and devour there were bands with disney characters performing throughout the day and at various spots arcades full of sweet treats shops packed with merchandises stands filled with delicious food and drinks to tantalise your tastebuds it was a kaleidoscope as far as the eyes could see but most importantly the place was filled with laughter gushes of excitement undoubtedly the happiest place on earth in our books ,5,2018-08-02
2237,Some old favourites and new rides,peak summer time might not be the best time to visit large crowds very hot but this place is still a blast ,4,2018-08-02
2238,Lost it's magic,not my first time visiting disneyland but will be my last we may have chosen a busy time of year to go but they really do pack way too many people in it s clearly more about the money for them than providing a good experience for the visitors ride waiting times were ridiculous with some of them around hours we paid for our family to visit yet only had time for rides in the whole day and we arrived early you can always pay more for fast track tickets but we felt we had already paid more than enough i really don t agree with the fast track system anyway giving priority to those with the most money if the fast track system wasn t in place then overall waiting times would be far shorter again it s clearly all about the money for them now ride times aside the place was so busy that it was hard to even walk down the road without bumping into people food drink and merchandise is way overpriced we all felt completely ripped off by the end of the day and definitely wont be returning ,2,2018-08-02
2239,Happiest VIBES on earth,im always happier after i leave this amazing amusement park this place has it all great for family and friends,5,2018-08-02
2240,Great fun for everyone!,we recently returned from a multi generational trip to disneyland it was wonderful staying at the californian enable us to skip the lines entering the park using a fastpass ensured that we never waited to long for any ride there was plenty of activity for everyone to enjoy from ages there was a crowd but we didn t really feel it until the last day a saturday the park is flat which made for easy walking i really recommend this trip ,5,2018-08-02
2241,Quintessential Disney,the park is the best part of disneyland and perfect for all the old world disney nostalgia great for any age group and the best place to spot the characters ,5,2018-08-02
2242,The original,it all started here it s still worth a visit use the fast pass to your advantage and avoid some lines start early and stay late to see everything,5,2018-08-01
2243,Fun but crowded,we had a blast it was very crowded and hot but the lines moved quickly definitely get a fast pass ,5,2018-08-01
2244,Fast Pass!!!,i was dreading going to disneyland in july when schools out and on a weekend sun but i was pleasantly surprised the fast pass was great it really saved us time from waiting in the lines also go early we went as soon as the park opened at am and was able to walk up to the rides with no wait times midday we were able to utilize our fast pass got on about rides for the day we could have done a lot more but didn t really want to didn t see much characters walking about which was a little dissapointing but still had a great time bottled water was average of but there were plenty of water fountains but i guess if you re going to disneyland you d expect that already you can bring your own food and water bottles if you d like but you ll be schlepping it around with you everywhere caution to those that get motion sickness don t go on the matterhorn or star tours otherwise great trip ,5,2018-08-01
2245,Max pass is the way to go,disneyland is fun for all ages but with cranky older kids who hate lines spending the extra to get max pass is well worth it no places to charge phone though and pay huge for charger pod so pack a recharger as using app will drain battery faster ,5,2018-08-01
2246,Magical,we had a fantastic time at disneyland the park was extremely clean and tidy the staff were friendly patient and polite since visiting years ago some rides had been updated pirates of the caribbean and is a small world these subtle differences enhanced these favourites make use of the fast pass system it works effectively and means not waiting over an hour in line in the blistering heat we had a four day pass which gave us access to disneyland and the california adventure park we found a good time to go on popular rides like big thunder railroad and indiana jones was during the fireworks the rides in fantasyland are closed during this time there were no queues ,5,2018-07-31
2247,Birthday Fun!,who doesn t love disneyland if you have kids its a must to visit the park purchase the hoper so visit both parks to get the full experience my daughter loves disneyland we always have fun the rides are awesome and we enjoy the parades we visit at least once a year ,5,2018-07-31
2248,Been going for 50 years and still it’s the best ever,love the park clean friendly cast members only downside was minute wait to get through security check but it was very crowded so understandable but disappointing could improve on that aspect attractions are fun used the fast pass option to help with waiting times in line stayed in a nearby hotel so we could walk back and forth from disneyland to california adventure and hotel for midday lunch or swim got tickets ahead of time so coyld enter the park and enjoy every minute fantasyland is wonderful for adults and kids alike fireworks are a must see loved the pineapple dole whip donut on main street was special to ride in the double decker bus to the castle monorails were clean and well maintained ,5,2018-07-31
2249,Summer vacation 2018,had a blast at disneyland we did a day park hopper and hit this park twice staff are friendly and very helpful definitely a magical place ,5,2018-07-31
2250,meh,it s ok it s really expensive for not that much you can walk around the park in about an hour lines are way too long the rides are very cool if you have the patience to wait on the lines if you don t go you didn t miss out ,2,2018-07-30
2251,wonderful but very crowded,park tickets should be limited more restrooms benches water fountains greatly needed had a fun time ,5,2018-07-30
2252,Still The Happiest (Yet Expensive) Place on Earth,my year old grandson loved our visit he did almost all the rides except indiana jones due to height requirement including space mountain cars and star tours very grateful he enjoyed himself so much ,4,2018-07-30
2253,Great,great park still has the magic definitely will come back again as always great customer service ,5,2018-07-30
2254,Happiest place,took my family there on a busy summer day and it was great the fast pass upgrade is a must it made waiting for rides almost non existent prices where high as expected for a theme park the one anoying thing that happen was waiting for picture with mickey mouse it took over an hour there were no signs warning of this crazy line and no bathrooms in his house for my year old to pee other than that though it was incredible ,4,2018-07-30
2255,Plan vacation,california disneyland was amazing this location is perfect for little one but definitely not for some youth due to some of the kiddy rides is almost perfect for little kids everyone can ride on this location only wished for more characters to come out to meet and greet the children s ,4,2018-07-29
2256,Visit on off days,great place to visit try to go on days where it is not high season if you do visit prepare to pay a lot of money best thing if you visit times a year get the annual pass be patient with long lines if you stay overnight at a nearby hotel i prefer to stay at a hyatt property there are within close proximity ,4,2018-07-29
2257,Wonderful and exciting ... as you would expect and more,family usa holiday day disneyland the best day again like universal studios day is enough plan and do what you want take the disney rail for a comfy and nostalgic orientation and see where you need to go we did this after a lovely start at the jolly holiday bakery cafe before i forget express pass is the go if the ride is open then to frontierland and nosquare our first ride was the big thunder v fun all and then space mountain then space mountain then autopia we lined again for space mountain however a fault closed wasted time then the splash mountain and the matterhorn great parades too tired for fireworks ,5,2018-07-29
2258,Not on par with DisneyWorld Florida,having had an excellent time in disney florida a few years ago we were excited to be spending two days here when visiting california very disappointed we left early and we didn t come back on the second day we went to six flags magic mountain instead the selection of rides is limited if you are looking for some thrill rides and certainly doesn t offer the same scope and scale as their park in florida service was great as was the ambiance in the park just not recommended if you are with teenagers ,2,2018-07-29
2259,Back to childhood,going with kids took me back to my childhood i was enjoying like kid really liked this fast pass sis must with photo options and planning your day as it quoet busy mostly on weekends and peak times only complaint is its little pricey place for souvneirs and entry is pricey as well but understandable souvneir tip buy at walgreens its cheaper there and ticket prices wel its same everywhere,4,2018-07-28
2260,Happiest place on earth!!,how lucky to be living in la i can drive to disneyland everyday if i want to became an annual pass holder so worth it love going there early early early in the morning when they first open rush to the most popular rides with zero wait time plus the weather is cool ,5,2018-07-28
2261,Just what you would expect,disneyland is busy all the time but the strollers and motorized wheelchairs were just too much for the most part it seems as if people utilizing these vehicles command the road and demand right of way the rides were great and we got a max pass which was fun to utilize there are no gluten free dietary options so i found myself starving or eating unhealthy options ,3,2018-07-28
2262,Unbeatable for the kids,well as an adult i would stay away but our kids loved it and that s who it is for really the whole experience is magical i d recommend going for the maxpass option as you will be able to skip some of the legendary lines dollars a day for maxpass the places to eat are much oess imporessive though we only ate there as there we had no choice you have to stay for the end of evening fireworks show too ,5,2018-07-28
2263,loved it,i ve been to disney world florida so was nice to see the original staff are friendly characters are everywhere had so much fun will definitely be back ,5,2018-07-28
2264,Mistreated at the gate even as annual pass holder,as an annual passholder you would expect to be treated at a higher level than their guests you also expect your family to be treated at least equally but better being that you frequent the park and spend on many of their amenities sadly being an annual passholder has negatives that i never expected when we arrived at the gate the guy scanning the tickets said there is something wrong with our pass and he had to wait to get the manager they let me wife go in and daughter but made me wait outside the gate which felt like an eternity i was embarrassed to watch as many people just constantly go in which the manager had to do their rounds it didn t help that the guy doing the scanning felt that other customers had higher priority even though i was ahead of them so he had the manager take their requests first finally the manager said yes there is a problem with the annual pass she required my driver license and then left again as i waited some more time finally coming back and saying that i can go in it s unfortunate that i would be mistreated this way it could have been easily resolved by putting me inside the gate which letting the manager do their processing instead i have to wait outside the gate while constant adults kids and babies get let in while i am embarrassingly just sitting outside the gate a kid even started touching my phone because i was waiting and he saw something interesting on my phone i have written and even called customer service at disney land about my complaints they responded after i called multiple times and said that they would remedy the situation i have never heard back from them since i feel they only would do something if they knew it was a liability concern where they would get in trouble to the normal frequent customer that just leaves comments they don t care about they could really do a better job of customer service especially for annual passholders ,1,2018-07-27
2265,Happiest place on earth,visited for the first time ever for my th birthday it was magical everything was first class,5,2018-07-27
2266,Fun place even with big crowds,i love disneyworld been there times so i was apprehensive about a smaller park and visiting disneyland in july no problem this park can handle crowds well the stores eateries and some rides were easily accessible in disneyland and disney california sure there were some long lines but overall it was still a fun happy place for kids as well as adults i would have given this park stars yet found that the disney costume characters found around the park were sparse or didn t have time for the kids they seemed in a rush to get somewhere else i didn t find this disney character shortage at disneyworld unless they ve changed characters visits too all in all disney is a first rate park whether in california or florida hope to visit again soon ,4,2018-07-27
2267,Disneyland Has Something For Everyone,we re huge disney fans and we have always done disney world i actually think disneyland has more for smaller children to do it was fun going on the nostalgic rides that disney world no longer has this park didn t seem as crowded and is definitely more laid back than any of the parks at world i actually might like this place more than magic kingdom ,5,2018-07-27
2268,Fab,we had a two day pass one for each park due to the time it took us to travel to the park from beverley hills set off at got there am ish once parked we then walked to the park as i have a pushchair and bags which then makes the train a difficult option we therefore did adventure park previous day and disney on our second day so we could have longer we also then knew we needed to be setting off earlier too earlier you can get there the better parking is easy just take a photo of the area you are in so remembering when you come back to the car park is a lot easier and less stressful on a plus side you get the walk through downtown which has lots of little market stalls and a few shops the lady told me not to buy fast pass as it isn t worth the cost as you can use the fast pass machines in the park so we went for that option only issue with this is that the fast pass machines are for individual rides usually and fp machine is therefore near the ride you want meaning you have to walk there get tickets then go off and do other stuff to then go back having said that you feel like you do lots of walking but i was surprised at the steps i actually did k and that s with walking from the car park too we loved the park but a little disappointed with size of the castle it doesn t compare to paris or florida you don t get that wow feeling as you walk down main street what i really liked is how the park is set out the same as florida and paris so finding you way around the areas is easier rides due to size of park isn t the same bobsleigh ride had huge queues we had fast pass for this but given all the hype o was disappointed later found out that this is the original ride which is why so popular we loved the indiana jones ride as we had the day before in the adventure park and an early start in thus park we were absolutely shattered and just didn t feel could stay for the fireworks weather had also taken its toll as just so hot getting into the car parks was tedious and slow however getting out was quick and easy and took mins to drive back to beverly hills,5,2018-07-27
2269,Magical Place,my first ever visit and i was in amazement disneyland is truely a magical experience i am glad i chose disneyland over disneyworld we stayed in a hotel across the road which really convenient which i would recommend you do i strongly recommend downloading the app and purchasing the maxpass it was so handy being able to secure fastpasses on your phone saving you valuable time the queues were then so quick we only had one day here we didn t get to see and do everything but did enough to have an amazing time get there early before opening and join the line to enter first thing the lines for major attractions are short we went on a wednesday to avoid magic morning which worked out well food and drink is expensive there are cheaper restaurants outside the park which you can easily pop out to for a break which a lot of people did we even popped back to our hotel for a quick swim before heading back into the park tip if you get a photo taken at the entrance by disney photographers make sure that the train isn t parked there as it covers the disneyland sign which is the main reason to get a photo there our photographer took our photo with the train there and it ruined the important photo which i was very disappointed with as it s a very important iconic landmark as we had our backs to the sign we couldn t see that the train was behind us and blocking it the photographer should ve picked this up the rides are absolutely amazing with so much detail making my childhood dream into a reality space mountain made me feel sick i get motion sickness and i didn t realise this ride was going to be so so fast my daughter loved it however but not me the fantasmic show at pm is a sight to be seen for sure ,5,2018-07-27
2270,Fun day,sorry california but coming from florida with disney world there is no comparison we were at a convention with disneyland included for one day i did not feel the same ambience staff did not seem to grasp the happiest place on earth policy of disney we felt they were not overly happy being there the rides are much the same as disney world for a coke is daylight robbery but it was hot so what can you do the park is within walking distance of many hotels without having to stay at disney hotels which is good my advice would be to take lots of money or pop out for lunch at close by eating places and a rest then return to the park later when it is a bit cooler i wouldn t be in a hurry to go back but glad to say i ve been ,4,2018-07-26
2271,VACATION,i had a great time at both parks would go back again and again i love disneyland the happiest place on earth you must come and experience the magic ,5,2018-07-26
2272,Let Yourself Live the Magic,heat crowds expense none of this matters it s all worth it to be in and at the magical kingdom birthday wish trip for year old to see the smiles and fun is priceless find shade use fastpasses indulge there are plenty of places in the park less crowded you just have to be willing to find them make a plan and relax we were in the park days and did all the major rides we wanted we don t do shows parades we ride and eat recommend reservations for most restaurants build your fastpass times around the shows food and shopping i d go everyday if i lived out there look forward to my next visit relax slow down have comfortable shows clothes sunscreen an umbrella and hat are ideal enjoy the scenery natural and man made ,5,2018-07-26
2273,Very historic and a smaller feel than Disneyworld.,loved this park and had a very relaxing time great fun and easy to get around very historic feel very pleasant weather and all around great time had by all best mickey ever ,5,2018-07-26
2274,A Day at the Park,disneyland was a wonderful experience the original park did not disappoint i also loved california adventure ,5,2018-07-26
2275,The Happiest Place on Earth!?,ah disneyland what can you really say that everybody else hasn t already covered this is an awesome place to visit the rides the magic the decor everything really but it is expensive very much so a day multi park pass for people can easily set you back almost a weeks pay and the food inside is almost prohibitively costly for a single churros and for a bottle of water play it smart take in plenty of drinks and some snacks and then eat in one of the many establishments outside the park and yet we will go back any time we can ,5,2018-07-26
2276,Always Awesome,disneyland never disappoints the cast is always engaged friendly and helpful the park always looks new and is immaculately maintained the rides are always engaging my only complaint is the fast pass system we stood in line for an interminable time because on each occasion fastpass holders would be let through against people in the regular line and this happened literally every minute so it took us nearly hours to get to the ride there had to be a better way to do this so that it is fairer on everyone ,5,2018-07-26
2277,Check that box!,we have been to disneyworld many times disneyland is much smaller tighter it was crowded during our stay we elected not to purchase maxpass or park hopper and the consequence was waiting in long lines and only riding a half dozen rides the kids got restless we tired of waiting in line and we left to go get dinner still we checked the box and have now been to mickey s parks on both coasts if you had to choose go to disneyland first before disney world ,3,2018-07-26
2278,Had it be done.,as we were in la we thought we better do disney i was concerned that it wouldn t really be suitable for teenagers it was ok but i think they need more rides for teenagers to make it really worth while the kids said they enjoyed it and where glad they went but i don t think it justified the pp price tag unless you have small kids the fast passes can only be booked one at a time so either after you have taken a ride or mins later whichever comes first the problem is you at restricted to a hour time slot and once they fill up that s it so by lunchtime many of the big rides weren t bookable until pm that evening so again it s not really a fast pass ,3,2018-07-26
2279,Love Disneyland,our family loves disneyland yes it is hot and crowded but it is full of fun and adventure my advice would be to learn about the disneyland app before you leave on your adventure and to use maxpass there are lots of blogs to help you manage your time learn which rides to wait in line for and which rides to use fastpasses for to minimize waiting it is possible to ride all the big rides and many smaller rides by lunchtime without waiting all of the lands are fun filled with something for everyone ,5,2018-07-26
2280,too crowded too expensive,its disney its worth a visit but we went on a hot day on a wednesday midweek thinking it would be less people i was wrong there must have been a million people or more im not kidding it was soooo crowded we only were able to ride some kids rides that only had minute waits and a couple others because ppl started lining up for the parade the rest of the rides were hour plus and many were hours or more if you have the and don t want to spend the entire day waiting in hot lines with no coverage from the sun get one of the ride passes this visit was so unsatisfying it has been years since my last visit and i don t think i feel the need to ever go back they need to limit ticket sales so that you can actually enjoy some rides but they wont because disney wants the they need to put up some sort of sails or something to give people coverage from the sun while waiting you wait in line to park you wait in line to go through security you wait in long line to actually enter the park you wait in extremely long lines for rides essentially you pay to wait in lines i do have to admit the food services were good fast service and tasty food that s it the only positive ,2,2018-07-25
2281,Disney,we had a great time cast members were awesome and helpful recommend carnation cafe for lunch or dinner ,3,2018-07-25
2282,Fantastic visit,this was my first time to disneyland it was not exactly what i was expecting but i enjoy everything disney so i was not disappointed but there were some things that could have been better the rides were all very similar to the ones that i have ridden at disney world i was hoping for a different experience and maybe that is why they have opened california adventures my budget only allowed for one day at the parks several rides were closed unexpectedly during our visit the matterhorn was closed during our fast pass time and reopened shortly after but then there was a long line later that night i noticed it closed again with people having to exit the bobsleds while out on the track i am glad we did not experience that the haunted mansion ride stalled while we were on it but it resumed within a minute we were in line for pinocchio daring adventure when that broke down also our favorite ride was the indiana jones ride it was exciting and a new experience for us all of the other rides we were able to ride in our shortened time were great i will say i was disappointed that there were not very many character experiences while walking the park i did not see a single princess till the fantasmic show i did see the pixar parade and that was great there was only one ride photo available and that was astro blasters and the quality was super poor i expected more photographers to be stationed around the park to take pro photos of us the photos that we did get are great and i can not wait to share them with all of my family and friends ,5,2018-07-25
2283,3 day hopper pass,the magic hour which is admittance one hour before the general tickets was more like a magic minutes and only tomorrow land and fantasy land were open that was a little disappointing ,4,2018-07-25
2284,The rides,the rides here were so polished for being around for years everything was in such great condition i like the fact that the rides all revolved around the movies that i grew up loving ,5,2018-07-25
2285,fantastic for a family!,great day out exhausting but great kids absolutely loved it kids loved interacting with the characters and going on all the rides ,5,2018-07-25
2286,Get there early,when you get to disneyland remember that you are not the only one there there be s of thousands of people there there will be a long line to get into the parking structure then there is a long line for a security check a tram ride and then a line to get into the park the earlier you go the shorter the line by mid day the park will be packed now is the time to go on rides that you can relax on like it s a small world you need to rest in the middle of the day if you are going to stay for the fireworks and the fireworks display is a good one and the best place to see it is right in front of it s a small world enjoy ,5,2018-07-25
2287,PLENTY OF WALKING,wear your walking shoes and be patient plenty of crowds this time of year but at least there is plenty of shade with well established trees front of line passes help and try and do rides while street parades are on plan your day well using the new disney app it will make your day so much easier ,4,2018-07-25
2288,10 out of 10 out of 10 WOULD RECOMMEND!!!!!!!,wow we are just big kids apparently we had the best time of our lives at disneyland it just so much fun and you can see why its a number one attraction considering how many people go through here its amazing how clean it is the staff are some of the best on the planet the rides are what i expected amazing however you will need to get used to queuing most rides can take an average of to minutes despite the general wait times we still had the time of our lives cant believe i m bothering with a review of disneyland its just so amazing ,5,2018-07-25
2289,Nice Quick Disney Trip,bought disney tickets at our hotel and skipped the line park was pretty busy but managed to go on few rides star tours is a must along with pirates of the caribbean and guardians of the galaxy california adventure churros are delicious but they are pricey as well as the food you can bring water and small snacks to get you going through out the day be prepared for security it s a whole separate line and it can be long overall it was fun and took lots of good pictures ,5,2018-07-24
2290,With or without kids...fun!,we went with three other couples and no kids this time and we had a blast make sure to get the maxpass it is worth the extra money we used the app and maximized the rides without waiting in the horrendous lines the staff and service were awesome as always the only downside the high cost admission at a piece is a bit much but there is no competition ,4,2018-07-24
2291,Loved the old rides with the animatronics,we really enjoyed fantasyland as they have some rides that the world does not have including the alice in wonderland ride and the mad hatter these were my daughters favorites the matahorn bobsleds were favorites also but i found them very bumpy ,4,2018-07-24
2292,Great Park!,a smaller park than disneyworld but we still had a great day it was very hot but the lines weren t very long we were able to get fast passes for lines that were a bit longer a few of the rides that we really enjoyed were gurdians of the galaxy maters junkyard jamboree and the incredicoaster that is part of the new pixar pier the firework show at the end of the night was excellent also ,5,2018-07-24
2293,The Happiest Place On Earth,i waited years to experience disneyland and for the most part it was spectacular the park is immaculate i searched trees and buildings to find cobwebs and i did not find a single one or any bugs or bees or stains or mess that s pretty amazing the staff was spectacular friendly patient and the staff never break character we had only one day to complete our disney adventure and thanks to the max ticket option we were able to ride all the rides we planned to ride the firework shows going off at both parks at one time was spectacular and best seen by the its a small world ride the majority of people like to watch it from near the castle but i don t like being squished in with the crowds so seeing it from the it s a small world ride was a great option overall our disney experience was awesome the downsides of disney are the lack of good food this is an area of customer service that really needs to be addressed the price you pay for a family to experience disneyland is very high so i feel the food does not live up to the experience expected however there is one restaurant located in the pirates of the caribbean ride and we were able to get lunch reservations about a week or so before our trip dinner reservation i ve heard take months with that said it is awesome but the prices are between and a plate if you want drinks and appetizers or desert your walking out with a much lighter wallet in closing i don t suggest you do disneyland in a day but if that s all the time you can schedule it will be an awesome day ,5,2018-07-24
2294,Oldschool,very nice rides and small park with good walking distances a classic for disney lovers the original,4,2018-07-24
2295,It's a small world after all!,we are from florida so this park was definitely smaller than disney world it reminded us of universal studios in orlando overall there were some different rides that we don t have in orlando so it was fun exploring clean fun and magical so disney didn t disappoint the day we went the lines weren t to long so we were happy campers ,5,2018-07-24
2296,Fun day!,we spent a very hot july day at disneyland the maxpass was great and worth the extra cost my husband had sprained his ankle a few days before we stopped by the first aid area to get an ice pack as it was very sore the staff were very helpful and let us sit on a cot to make sure it was ok ,5,2018-07-23
2297,It's still Disneyland,stayed in town for vidcon got four day passes for disney for the group day visits to the park proved frustrating with long hot waits and very little actual riding night time was the right time returning after allowed us to get on more rides with shorter waits on average we rode about rides a day in the end it s still disneyland though a magical place ,4,2018-07-23
2298,A lot smaller than expected,it s disney so you know everything is top notch having been to disney world things seemed small but it was an incredible experience the haunted mansion was awesome for anyone who likes creepy stuff the indiana jones ride is definitely worth the wait they did a great job with the decorations to really make you feel immersed ,5,2018-07-23
2299,A long day,disneyland is very very very large after you have been there hundreds of times it all still remarkable we loved seeing the young kids enjoying the rides the characters and all of the interaction enjoyed moving from shady spot to shady spot and bench to bench in the shade all in all it was a fantastic visit to the funnest place on earth ,5,2018-07-23
2300,Life Long Dream,going to disneyland park has been a life long dream and it did not disappoint i sort of knew what to expect as i have watching many videos and read many things about the park i knew it would be very similar to disney world s magic kingdom yet it has a vibe all it s own with some rides the same some rides better and some rides you can only find at disneyland the only two negatives are the current fastpass maxpass is lacking compared to disney world s magic band system and i found that the cast members were apathetic at best and surly at worst precious few exuded the disney magic and smiles that i am used to at a disney park resort ,5,2018-07-23
2301,The Best Day Ever!,didn t know where to start as we entered to park as there were so many things to see and do and so many food choices had a wonderful day with family ,5,2018-07-23
2302,Expensive! Some rides not so PC,if you want to eat in a sit down restaurant make reservations early the blue bayou was booked a week out prepare to spend a lot of money mangmt needs to get some diversity training some early attractions are offensive ,5,2018-07-23
2303,One Day at Disneyland,our family visited disneyland on a sunday in june and had a magical time we experienced over different rides attractions got to meet quite a few characters and saw fantasmic as well as the evening fireworks show the most important things we did was to arrive early and buy the maxpass which i think is a great value after spending so much money to get there and on park tickets we really debated paying another each for the maxpass but decided that it might be worth it since we only had one day at the park it was a great decision my wife really appreciated having access to unlimited photos by the park staff and being able to get a fastpass on your phone was a huge time saver we found the app very easy to use and it no doubt allowed us to do more rides it is so much better than walking around and finding the fastpass machine for each ride the app shows each fastpass ride and what time your pass will be good for after a certain amount of time or after you use a fastpass you can get another one i can t overstate how easy this made planning our day in the park even if you don t get the maxpass i would definitely get the disneyland app it shows wait times for each ride shows where and when characters are and you can even order food from the restaurants that will be ready when you arrive arriving early is also another key thing when visiting the park since we arrived early we had no wait at security or entering the park many of the rides had no line and the weather was great we went to california adventures the next day and didn t arrive early and it was a huge contrast we easily waited an hour to get through security and the park gates and there were a lot more people in the park we didn t map out our day ahead of time or spend a lot of time on planning but just a little planning really made the day more worthwhile we had a magical day at the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-07-23
2304,Very busy only managed 5 rides,max pass is debatable as being worthwhile we entered just after am and left at pm visited both parks and only managed rides the max pass system is great but only if it is limited some express lanes still took half an hour i thing for the money spent on a hopper ticket for the benefit of only five rides is not great value for money such a shame as the disney experience is second to none they really need to work on the max pass system and try and make it more worthwhile ,4,2018-07-22
2305,New pass holders,oh who don t love disney well it was a great time surprised on how short all the lines were longest we waited was minutes and returning in august have to get our money worth ,5,2018-07-22
2306,July 4th visit,we love disneyland we spent the first week in july and had a blast we enjoyed pirates and space mountain we watched the fireworks show amazing you do need to find a spot at least minutes before the scheduled time disneyland was magical and cant wait to go back ,5,2018-07-22
2307,Afternoon together,great times everything and everyone was fantastic the crouds was largely causing long waits recommend not going before checking on estimated crouds,5,2018-07-22
2308,A day away from convention,we got a hour early entrance with our huge company however not everything was open staff seemed confused and we had rides either not working or break down on us while we were there the photographers were amazing especially when you buy the fastpass loved getting extra pics just hated long waits even with the pass then long waits for trams to go back to parking it s been years since i visited bring all your patience when you arrive ,4,2018-07-22
2309,Love It!,hubby and i love disneyland the rides are amazing i love the classics haunted mansion is my favorite theming is what disney does best and it is on full display here yes it s crowded but with proper planning and judicious use of fast passes the crowds and wait times are manageable ,5,2018-07-22
2310,Beautiful nightlife,our family loves the night shows fireworks expect tones of ppl i the park at night however the park is well organized that even though everyone leaves at the same time there s not a long wait time ,5,2018-07-22
2311,Lazy? You won’t get your moneys worth in July.,it s hot in july there is limited seating shade and indoor activities with teenagers we ended up riding the train doing two small rides with and minute waits and taking pics with pooh spent some money watched the parade and headed out warn smooth out ,3,2018-07-21
2312,We loved it,my family and me went last month it was a wonderful two days we spent as family we purchased multiple tickets for both parks two days is enough but my recommendation is to purchase the fast tickets save your time and have more fun ,5,2018-07-21
2313,As always a great place to visit,get the max pass as it makes the day far more efficient i will say after having been to every disney park short of china spanning the last years this trip showed some flaws in the magical experience a number of rides had some glitches bathrooms were not very clean max pass app broke one day but after an hour a cast member set up a fix and it had it running by midday early park entry is good and bad a number of rides were not open in disneyland park and adventure park none were see adventure park review food was expensive and salty but to be expected we did the entire park s major rides and some of the minor ones in a full day k steps and sitting down for meals enjoy your time ,4,2018-07-21
2314,Horrible place now to visit. Don’t waste your time or money!,it makes me very sad to say disneyland is a horrible place to visit now we just went last week yrs ago we took my daughter in the summer and it was wonderful we have been to disneyworld in florida several times and it s crowdwd but still special and employees have a good attitude and it s efficient disneyland is a nightmare now we went on a wednesday and what they don t tell you is that they block the weekends now for annual pass holders so everyone goes during the week awful way too crowded wait in line for everything including water and bathrooms waits go up to minutes they let way too many people in everyone there seems like they are going through the motions paid extra for the max pass and got to use it once b c rides kept shutting down monorail was down at night are you kidding can barely walk through the crowds walt would be rolling in his grave if he saw the state of the park whoever is running this place has gotten very greedy and just lets the whole world in app is very user unfriendly go to universal studios hollywood instead much more efficient and employees care very sad not one person told us to have a magical day which is standard we have a better experience at the disney stores in the midwest its not the happiest place on earth but the crappiest ,1,2018-07-21
2315,"Disney World is much better, but still fun!",in my opinion i was a little disappointed by disneyland it is basically a smaller and not as fun place than disney world the castle is very small and the park overall is pretty small but it is disney and i still did have a great time we only did one day and i would say definitely don t do both parks in one day we could barely get through the one park in one day so i would recommend going to the parks across a few days disneyland is so cute and fun but if you are looking for more thrill rides definitely go to california adventure disneyland is more for experience and storytelling than the big kid rides but overall i loved being there and pixar fest was adorable for fireworks i definitely recommend getting a spot early on we walked around to try to find a spot that wasn t blocked by the trees and it was so hard most of the show is projected on the castle so if you can see that then stay where you are ,3,2018-07-21
2316,First time visiting,a dream for me since i was a little girl i was lucky enough to be able to take my teenage boys the detail in the rides and exhibits is very good as a first time visitor i would highly recommend getting a run down on the express pass it was late in the afternoon before someone explained the system and by then it was too late however we still had a great time and the value was good,4,2018-07-20
2317,Shaking my head...,if you re a hardcore fan of old school disney then this is the best place in the world for you lots of characters and more rides in total here than disneyworld if not it s just ridiculous crowds long lines especially for food and corny rides and attractions only a handful of photopass people around just not worth person for admission ,3,2018-07-20
2318,Disneyland in the summer...,not my favorite time to visit disneyland it s hot it s busy i m exhausted tip spend the money staying near walking distance to downtown disney spend early morning getting fast passes and a ride have lunch at downtown disney or doordash at your hotel spend the hot part of the day noon pm in a pool go back into the park at night save the heat and crowds for everyone else overall i feel disneyland is over priced but when you have kids it is fun to experience a few times the shows and parades are amazing don t skip them ,4,2018-07-20
2319,"Eh, not my favorite",disneyland does not compare to california adventure we spent a few hours since we had not been in many years and that was more than enough time this park is good for younger kids but very little to do for kids who like adventure ,3,2018-07-20
2320,Fun for all ages,disney does it right with detail in everything from stores to rides fastpass options at no charge can get you right to the front of lines you have to be strategic though and use them for the busier rides the maxpass can get you all your photos from rides and with characters top class fireworks show parade and fantasmic parking is expensive though so walk if you can or take a shuttle from your hotel if you can ,5,2018-07-20
2321,Must get max pass fast pass,great time in disneyland with our family great theme park with so many things to do i would recommend getting park hopper and max pass plus so easy to get fast passes on your phone we hardly ever waited in line also you can single rider certain rides which also saves time from waiting in line the pixar fireworks show is amazing as well ,5,2018-07-20
2322,What can I say...The happiest place on earth!,all disney parks are going up in price i am glad my children are grown now because taking a family is very expensive the day we went the lines were not too bad unfortunately the heat was we got most of the rides done without problems and fast passes the food options are better here than at walt disney world my biggest complaint fantasmic standing room only is absurd for anyone under and over you have to stand in a very compact space for at least a hour ,5,2018-07-20
2323,Thoughts on Disney as a solo traveller,i visited disney back in february when i was in town at a work conference i ended up meeting a friend to go into the paid area of disney land i had been to disney world in florida many years ago and don t remember it being as busy when i went it was near impossible to get around the stroller highway lines were very long as well for any ride my thoughts on disney land when traveling alone is that it is great if you have never been before or have kids who would enjoy it traveling alone though and having been before it is not something i would go back too downtown disney is great though the free area is a great spot to shop people watch and have some food or a drink keep in mind it isn t cheap though so ya if you haven t been before definitely check it out but if you have i don t think it is worth revisiting ,3,2018-07-20
2324,First visit,family of families first trip from new zealand we found the park to be more than we imagined all the kids big and small loved it great security clean and plenty to do we had a day pass i d like better restroom signage and more ice block locations we loved our visit plenty of opportunities to see the disney characters fireworks and fantasia show amazing thank you to all staff ,5,2018-07-20
2325,Crowded Disneyland,not fun anymore when it is super crowded hour plus lines poor little kids crying hot tired hungry standing around waiting for hours for rides i feel sorry for both parents and little ones thousands of strollers and electric scooters difficult to get around because of the intense crowds also not sure how safe it is with that kind of crowding lines for rides hours ,1,2018-07-20
2326,It's Disney...it's awesome,if you love all things disney you ll love the park we ve gone during peak times in the middle of summer as well as slow times in the fall and winter and enjoy both careful planning can minimize line waiting times even during peak season ,5,2018-07-20
2327,Disneyland dreams come true,disneyland was amazing we had purchased a day park hopper for the price of so l felt we really got our money s worth our first day wednesday and the crowds we huge but not as big as friday saturday make sure you download the disneyland app it was so good to have we were able to purchase the fast past each day per person so it was a huge difference in skipping the lines also you could get as many photos as possible and get them through the qapp at no extra cost apart from the good value the app is good to have to let you know how long lines are etc and where everything is with a park hopper it allows you to hop from one park to the other in the same day otherwise you will have to stay in the same park and change over the next day honestly disneyland is so big you would need at least days there we could definitely come back and stay for days which l think would be a perfect amount of time but because we were on a tight schedule it could only be days but l felt we saw so much oh by the way sourin ride is the best also the star wars d ride be prepared to wait on line to enter you have bag checks and metal detectors to keep us all safe ,5,2018-07-20
2328,Happiest place on heart!,this is truly a magic place for kids where they get to meet their heroes and princesses the attractions are fabulous above all indiana jones star wars peter pan and small world are must see buy the fast pass it makes your life easier ,5,2018-07-20
2329,dreams that come true,my first visit with my kids to disneyland park was amazing to me more than for my kids because of my memories with these characters,4,2018-07-19
2330,No so happy place because of the long lines,one day pass is not enough because you will spend at least minutes minimum for queuing on each ride the park is full packed and we even went there during the weekdays there are so many rides available for all ages many shops and places to eat but of course everywhere is busy ,5,2018-07-19
2331,Disappointed,the place is ok but it is disappointed compared to magic kingdom in orlando disneyland is smaller and more expensive the attractions are pretty much the same with some excepcions like the indiana jone s ride and the space mountain that is much much better than the one in orlando but in a smaller place definitely disneyland does not have the magic of magic kingdom ,3,2018-07-19
2332,Disney,well disney is disney professional and clean but need to send some supervisors to universal studios to pick up on a few of there customer service attributes my biggest complaint is fill all seats on a ride to quicken the wait times it does not take much to ask for or set up a singles line that people can fill in the empty seats on a run,4,2018-07-19
2333,Amazing!!!,disneyland and all of its cast members truly go above and beyond to make the experience magical for all ages nothing is too much trouble and the staff are so friendly and welcoming ,5,2018-07-19
2334,Disneyline......,you can take a bag no open water containers if you vape you can get it in i vaped a couple times inside without issue must go through security before ticket check purchase went at on day one and walked right into park without a line after security minutes second day arrived at and waited minutes to enter the park lines same for both d land and c adventure after about minutes for security arriving early is your best bet as either park entry points are almost none use fast pass free and plan around them for eating shopping or waiting in other shorter lines we took three water bottles drank them on the walk and kept them to refill in the park at water fountains water there is about take sunscreen don t rush take your time and enjoy artistic elements of the parks you ll see plenty of rushers and be happy knowing your not one to do this always have a fast pass active you can always have one active and will learn the format quickly just read the fast pass tickets and plan ahead ,5,2018-07-19
2335,Definitely the happiest place!,for adults we enjoyed being kids for the day we were here from opening to close in summer long lines to get in and long lines for rides the park was packed shows and all parades are great food is a bit pricey and average but that is theme park food for you churros and mickey ice cream sundaes were a great treat worth paying the extra money on the disney app to book fast passes quicker and on your phone definitely worth staying for the night fireworks ,5,2018-07-18
2336,1st time visit and a blast,my first time visiting the park we used the max passes the longest wait i had for a ride was maybe minutes i recommend reservations for the nightly party at one of the restaurants near the lake ,5,2018-07-18
2337,"Disneyland, the happiest place on earth",some construction was happening as it was the low season even though i wasn t able to go on it s a small world everything else was fantastic,5,2018-07-18
2338,Very busy,having been to florida numerous times i was very surprised how busy this park was to the point of being uncomfortable even wdw in the height of summer is not this busy that said i love all things disney so could go on for ever about the rides etc the characters minders do not pay much attention to people pushing in or spending too long with a character but we got to see all we wanted to fantasmic is incredible better than wdw the dining package was worth it for the reserved seating ,5,2018-07-18
2339,Magic Memories,this really is an amazing experience for the whole family the rides character experiences and the dining are all wonderful opportunities to make wonderful memories ,5,2018-07-18
2340,A must Go if you’re in Los Angeles,los angeles disneyland located in anaheim it s not as big as the other disneyland around the world but it s still fun and the photo package is cheaper compared to other disneyland some of the characters meet and greet are not stationary they walk around the park so please do approach them if you see them in the park and ask for a photograph or signature have fun ,5,2018-07-18
2341,Nice day,the kids love disney and what s not to love we had lots of fun on the rides and seeing the characters long day for the adults but was worth it been to disney world a few times this was our first time here great visit ,5,2018-07-18
2342,Kids loved it and so did I.,get the max pass when inside the park for extra a day for each ticket it s a deal it pays for itself with the pictures and you can order the fastpass on your phone even after you leave the park you can still still get a fastpass every minutes ,5,2018-07-17
2343,"Magical, Immaculate, amazing, and the most fun I’ve had in years!",i am always a bit amused when i read one star reviews of disneyland the park is immaculately maintained landscaping perfect there s a clean trash can literally every feet this is because walt did extensive research which told him that the average guest will hang onto trash up to feet before they drop it on the ground issue solved also there are folks dressed in all white everywhere picking up whatever items miss the cans they even pick up leaves and every speck of everything else i saw a little boy last week and he accidentally dropped an ice cream bar on the ground he started to cry immediately a cast member ran over to him and gave him another ice cream bar the little boy lit up like a christmas tree and now the mother started to cry because the cast member was so friendly i ve also seen small kids pop balloons and they have been replaced immediately disney cast members consistently go above and beyond to make sure every guest has a smile at all times security is very tight and all bags and packages are thoroughly searched prior to park entry so just read the info on the website it s clear some stuff you just can t bring in i have an e cigarette and always bring my refill cartridges in their packaging and have never been questioned there is one clearly marked smoking area in each park guests are allowed to bring bottled water or juice and their own sandwiches or snacks not a problem you re not forced to purchase their food i am a pass go der and visit the parks often and i usually bring an apple a sandwich a candy bar and maybe a bag of chips no problem so when you read these complaints from others take a look at who is making those complaints disney has an excellent website and provides tons of tips and information so if you read it you ll easily be able to identify which attractions you want to see and when is the best time to experience them i always make sure i am at the parking entrance minutes before park opening the open the front gates minutes before park opening so you can enjoy main street with zero crowds amy attraction refurbishments and closures are clearly identified on the disney website accommodations are available in abundance on the property and all around at every price level and you get what you pay for you can get a clean modest hotel room for well under and frequently much less so if you re on a budget there are many ways you can still have a magical day on a tight budget overall this is the best entertainment destination experience you ll ever witness but if you re one of those folks who looks for every little thing you re probably going to have some complaint wherever you go with this attitude you ll be a big minority at disneyland because everyone else will be having so much fun that you will stick lit like a sore thumb no it s not cheap for tickets etc but you get what you pay for ,5,2018-07-17
2344,"""Disney Lite""",i grew up going to disney world so disneyland is to me disney lite everything is slightly bigger and better at disney world with the exceptions of pirates waaaaaay better at disneyland and the freakin matterhorn which is a blast this may be treasonous but i think they should tear down sleeping beauty s castle and build a new one but seriously if you ve been to world there are places you can t tell which park you re in that s pretty cool and its a nice park maxpass is an absolute must as is using the disneyland app for park wait times singing our fast passes and the app we never waited more than minutes for a ride be being very proactive and it was a blast definitely recommend but good lord that odd plastic smell in it s a small world and pirates and anything with animatronics its just weird ,4,2018-07-17
2345,California 2018,what can i say disneyland park completely met expectations i have to say la is far more friendly than florida before you go get an online disney account so you can use your mobile in the park you can then get a maxpass that enables you to do fastpass via your mobile l a disney is more compact than florida so you don t have to walk as far make sure you stay for the fireworks they re great fireworks ,5,2018-07-17
2346,wonderful,this was my third visit to disney and it never fails to impress we watched the new fantasmic show and it was really good lots of free entertainment and lots to do without having to pay great day out can spend more then one day at disney,5,2018-07-17
2347,So Fun!,everything at the disneyland park was well done from the rides to the shows and each character the park was incredibly clean going in july meant some very long lines for rides going in the morning or evening seemed better times for shorter lines they do offer the fast pass for some rides which definitely helped definitely plan to watch fantasmic which is an evening light and water show ,5,2018-07-17
2348,I didn’t expect that...!,i went to wdw in orlando i found the walt disney world in orlando much better than in la however you can t find a good restaurants to eat not like wdw in orlando,3,2018-07-17
2349,Not What I Expected,i can t even believe i just gave a disney park stars we absolutely love disney and are longtime visitors to wdw however this was our st visit to disneyland maybe it was the fact that we went over the th of july but we found the park unbearable after about pm thank goodness for maxpass we knew going in that it was a lot smaller than magic kingdom but holy cow the crowds the lines for food were crazy i waited minutes after i ordered at bengal bbq i had already been in line for about minutes just to order which wasn t too bad but to wait min to get the food was unbelievable and then one of our kabobs was raw in hindsight we should have used mobile ordering i think the thing that really did it for us were the numerous large families that were blatantly cutting the line i m talking ppl no joke pushing themselves thru or actually unhooking the chains this happened quite frequently it was unreal it made me think this was the norm here through out the park the cast members were a strange mix of extremely friendly and helpful to some that were downright rude which surprised me the wifi was spotty and my phone battery drained very quickly using the app make sure you have a few portable chargers on you i m a huge disney fan but i don t really have much of a desire to return other than to maybe see what we missed i was pretty disappointed since this was a longtime bucket list kind of thing we felt like we missed so much of the basic atmosphere because there were just so many people absolutely everywhere we only had one day in each park so that was part of the problem trying to cram it all in if i could do it again i would have gone with day park hoppers dl in the am and hop over to dca mid day dca was awesome btw which was another surprise ,2,2018-07-17
2350,Great for all aged,disneyland is a great place for young and old whether you like to ride the attractions get photos with disney characters or star wars or you watch the parades shows and fireworks you determine how your visit goes we did the five day flex pass hopper ticket it allowed us to visit either park the same day i highly recommend the max pass for per ticket per day not only does it give you the fast pass option with the app you can make appoints for attractions with the fast pass option but it gives you free downloads of all attraction photos and photos taken by the disneyland photographers that accompany characters or are at special spots around the park otherwise you have to pay per photo to download them so the is a small price to pay for the additional benefits some attractions have wait times over an hour to hours during peak times another way to spend less time in line for some attractions i d be a single rider they use you to fill in empty seats on a ride but you will not be able to ride with friends in the same seats also be prepared to walk we averaged over miles per day when riding as many attractions as possible there are free shuttles to disneyland from the toy story parking lot or the mickeymouse parking structure you don t even have to park there if your accommodations are close enough just walk to the parking lots and catch the shuttle another option are the city buses but they cost per day per person a backpack is a must to carry much needed water and snacks frozen water bottles are a great way to keep a supply of cold water water at the park goes for a bottle snacks and food are expensive lunch for a family of runs about disneyland is a must place to visit for family of all ages but your visit will depend on how well you plan be prepared to spend money but the memories will be priceless ,5,2018-07-16
2351,Magical As Always,my family and i had a delightful trip to disneyland park last week the magic was in full swing despite the toasty temperatures happily we were able to visit all of our favorite attractions thanks to their fastpass system the cast members were as friendly and helpful as ever they always are the cherry on top they sure know how to make things magical for park guests we will be back to our happy place next year ,5,2018-07-16
2352,Has some advantages over Disney World,i live in florida and have been to disney world more times than i can count this was my first visit to disneyland and unexpectedly i found myself thinking i preferred it over the larger version in orlando i found the fact that it s smaller and more compact and easier to get around to be an advantage the rides are just as good i strongly recommend downloading the disneyland app ahead of time then purchasing the max pass as soon as you are in the park per ticket was absolutely worth it and then booking your first fast pass you can only book ride at a time as soon as we scanned our fast pass at the ride as i was walking in line i would then book our next fast pass greatly preferred this to the disney world process in which you better book them online in advance as early as possible if you want to have any chance at getting a fast pass to the more popular rides or to using the kiosks the max pass also includes photo pass so if you re inclined to look at your photos as you get off the rides there is a code with each photo that you can key into the app and it links the photo to your ticket you can then view the photo on your phone and if you like it save it at no extra cost ,4,2018-07-16
2353,Disneyland July 2018,love disneyland its always an amazing experience i have been to disneyland lots of times and love it wary time and see something new each time you can never go wrong here complaint it took us an hour to get through security and another hour to get through the will call line we will never order tickets to will call again this was a tuesday morning ,4,2018-07-16
2354,A Great time,disneyland brings the sweetest memories of our childhood last month we spent a day there and the magic was in the air in the happiest place on earth i strongly recommend buying tickets in advance with maxi passes to beat the long lines for some of the atractions it is good to plan what other attractions you would go in between times to make the most of your time there don t forget to have a meet and great with mickey it doesn t matter if you are or that never gets old ,5,2018-07-16
2355,Family vacation,we had such a great time at disneyland my boys had the time of their lives the first day was very hectic and very tiring our second day was so easy and amazing it made up for the first day we saw so many characters and got their autographs we do wish we would have seen mickey and minnie mouse along with woody and buzz but me boys were happy to even see the princesses we will be there for sure again soon for another great family vacation ,5,2018-07-15
2356,Such a let down,we were excited to travel in to the park and see aurora s castle coming from disneyworld in orlando you have high expectations of disney as we turned the corner on main street and got our first glimpse of the castle you left with saying that s it the trees surrounding the castle were much taller than the castle is and instead of being in awe as you are when you first see cinderella s castle you get a better understanding of it s a small world this isn t the only big difference between disneyland and disneyworld it doesn t take long walking around to see there is no focus on the princesses at all this park will definitely leave you being thankful that walt had a much bigger dream in orlando ,2,2018-07-15
2357,"Great Place, Only Getting Better",we dropped in to visit after being away for a long time it was worth the visit highlights space mountain always a draw the top speed may be only miles per hour but the ride is a gas every time this is the first time i remember riding the california one and it was good to ride it the matterhorn this changed i don t remember going through water back in the day also the abominable snowman is more present in several places instead of one place it used to be in when i rode this last it s still a fun no inversion ride that moves fast and has some decent drops indiana jones ride this is set in a car which careens through various events it s pretty fun and almost everyone can ride star tours cp is now the pilot which works very well with the images updated to the latest star wars universe including the last jedi pirates of the caribbean updated to the movie theme and enjoyable look for captain jack sparrow in at least places two drops and more water splashing into the back seats then before peter pan same as usual a nice ride to cool off for a few minutes on a hot summer day buzz lightyear you can now pull the guns out and spin the car i thought i was doing well the other person in my party scored a lot more than i did schooled the jungle cruise we were working with someone on his first few cruises and his jokes and quips were as good as ever you can tell he had another cruise captain with him tarzans tree house formerly the swiss family robinson tree house good tarzan theme good for the kiddies snacks way expensive for popcorn granted freshly made is just crazy it costs around a package to make don t drop any the park ducks like it too much and it isn t good for them at for popcorn and for a bottle of water it gets expensive on hot days gone and missed the wedway people mover it was a nice slow ride astro orbiter was on top of the people mover has been relocated to the entrance of tomorrowland with the t movie logo thoughts figure out which ones you want to ride first and get fast passes in the order in which you want to ride them space mountain ended up being a pm fast pass because we wanted to ride california adventure stuff first parking if you aren t staying at the resort they will pick you up from the airport by the way so why rent a car if you are just going to disneyland there is a parking garage you walk to the tram and they take you to the park entrance you pay for parking unless you live around there and have an annual pass or stay in a hotel and take the airport shuttle to the hotel walking we did over miles between california adventure and disneyland theme parks ticket prices if you intend to go between parks on any given day since the entrances are around yards apart we strongly recommend the park hopper ticket park bathrooms have been renovated and are nicely done and fairly clean we were there on a saturday in july so the place was packed it wasn t spotless but they were clearly trying the shops are full of disney stuff and there is so much under the disney universe these days that the selection is very good if you can t have fun here well you need to find some help this is a great time ,4,2018-07-15
2358,It’s a magic place,yep it s disneyland it busy as you would expect but hay who cares it s disneyland get your self the fast passes and enjoy loved it,5,2018-07-15
2359,Family Trip,very good trip to disneyland brought back several good memories and it was a very enjoyable trip the magic morning is good but it does not include much access to the park during the early hour the key is being there ready to enter at opening time to do as much as possible before the crowds ,5,2018-07-15
2360,Happiest place on earth,my daughter and i had a wonderful time at disneyland the food the characters the entertainment was superb we will be back ,5,2018-07-15
2361,Save the best for last,the ticket is not expensive in my opinion adult and you can stay there all day and play all games the game i like most is driving cars in autopia shooting in galaxy with buzz lightyear spinning tea cup in wonderland don t miss the night performance at pm every day as it is beautiful and fantastic with fireworks lights music and all disney characters ,5,2018-07-15
2362,Family Vacation,we had a three day pass and which included california adventure our second day was our first day at disneyland we did all the areas using the fastpass with the exception of fantasyland and toon town on our third day we did the magic morning in by a m took the train to fantasyland to save us some footsteps and did toon town as well we left by p m due to the excessive heat it was celsius or fahrenheit we said let s hit the beach go to seal beach two thumbs up ,5,2018-07-15
2363,We love Disneyland,this was our second trip to disneyland and we loved it both times we go to disney world in orlando a lot but we all agree we like disneyland better,5,2018-07-14
2364,Amazing...but,it s funny disneyland park was crowded but the wait times were not as bad as disney world for most rides however when comparing the two overall world wins by a lot if it s cost you the same to travel to either go with world but you can t go wrong either way btw thunder and space mountain are better at disneyland ,5,2018-07-14
2365,Magical moments,a place to bring out the child in us again prepare comfortable shoes high energy and keep yourself hydrated it s best to park in your hotel then walk than to park in the property be sure to eat turkey leg watch the parade watch it twice on a friday catch the fireworks at on a friday ride only what you can take will come back again and again ,5,2018-07-14
2366,Disneyland,totally agree with a previous comment we took our year old granddaughter had a day pass and only used because she didn t want to go back again the lines are horrendous out dated and so short for the to minute line up the people are rude and obnoxious children wait in the heat while adults with so called fast passes get on kids rides first we went to universal studio first and our year old had a blast the rides are d graphics are fantastic and the commentary is brilliant staff are friendly and helpful and make sure that you feel welcome ,2,2018-07-14
2367,"NEVER TOO OLD! Always visit when in L.A.!!! Happiest Place on Earth, and it's true!!",all the old favourite rides and characters roam the park as well as few new ones leave your troubles and your age at the gate and just have fun get there early and swipe for a fast pass to star tours space mountain haunted mansion big thunder mountain railroad splash mountain and the matterhorn bobsleds large iced tea at starbucks on main street is only and the best value you will find in the whole park don t forget to stay after dark for the night parade and fireworks remember comfortable shoes sunscreen and hydration packs you can easily spend hours here ,5,2018-07-14
2368,Classic park experience,it s disneyland the happiest place on earth what more is there to say the park is clean kids and adults have fun the food prices have gotten a bit more expensive than they used to be but overall a good time ,5,2018-07-14
2369,The Original Theme Park,disneyland is the original theme park and draws much of its attractiveness from that even though many other theme parks are bigger brighter and less crowded and have more attractions surprisingly on the day we visited not a mickey mouse was to be seen despite the roaring trade in mickey mouse ears at all of the many retail outlets on site ,4,2018-07-14
2370,"Disney World is a lot better, but this is also nice",i had a really good time here despite the huge crowds and the intense heat i managed to ride almost every ride i wanted to ride and it s pretty exciting to now say i ve been to every disney park in the united states i ve been to walt disney world in florida and this past week i got to visit disneyland in california for the first time in my humble opinion i think wdw is the better park and if you re closer to florida there is no real reason to check out california s disneyland unless you really want to disney world feels more magical to me and i think the cast members in orlando are much more outgoing smiley and helpful despite having a stressful job in anaheim i noticed many of the cast members weren t too helpful and didn t seem as enthused about helping either another thing that made it worse was that in in anaheim all the ride queues were outdoors whereas in orlando most ride queues are indoors or better shaded probably due to florida s intense summers maybe overall california has the better weather but the day before we got there anaheim s degrees broke disney worldwide records and the day we were there the temperature averaged about degrees lining up under the sun wasn t fun definitely stay hydrated it was extremely crowded despite being a tuesday it felt like i had to pay extra attention to avoid bumping into people left and right i think because the park is a lot smaller it feels more crowded too i guess to be fair it s summertime and a time when many people visit the best thing is to keep trying to get fast passes we used max pass and i think that was worth it since we were able to collect all the pics of us from the rides we rode on the castle is small and cute but it s not awe inspiring like cinderella s castle in wdw i do like the fact that you can go through it and view sleeping beauty s story i felt that part was very well done as for rides people frequently compare matterhorn with the mt everest ride in animal kingdom i got on matterhorn pretty excited only to find it very jerky bumpy and not thrilling at all compared to everest there were no big drops and it felt rather slow needless to say i was disappointed with matterhorn i d say space mountain in disneyland felt slightly better than the wdw version thunder and splash mountains felt the same to me as in magic kingdom indiana jones felt exactly like the dinosaur ride in animal kingdom nothing felt spectacularly better here as compared to disney world so to me it wasn t that unique but comparisons aside i did really enjoy my time here and i do think it is an excellent disney park the wait times grew as the day progressed but the fast pass system made it easier i still find disney world more magical but that s just my opinion still worth checking out if you re a huge disney fan like me personally i plan on returning to wdw but i m not so sure i d go through the trouble of going to disneyland again next time i m in california or at least not for a long time ,4,2018-07-14
2371,Our kids camp, kids had a great time at disney resort fast track works great time thank you disney from california land to main street one adventure after another carnation cafe was a great place to have breakfast and start your day eggs sausage country potatoes toast the happiest place on earth because you can forget all your troubles and just have a great time ,5,2018-07-13
2372,better experience than WDW,we have been to wdw for many years and at least once a year dl is definitely more compact and with the new max pass it s well worth it if you want to do everything and hop back and forth between dl and dca our days were full of excitement we enjoyed dining at the plaza in for both character breakfast and quick service dinner lots of characters at breakfast including winnie the pooh eeyore fair godmother captain hook max goofy s son picture with minnie chip and dale tigger we also saw mickey peter pan belle cruella de vil the evil queen faries donald and daisy star war characters and many more while we were there maxpass also includes pictures with photopass people my family enjoys space man big thunder mtn star tours buzz lightyear and many other attractions throughout with maxpass overall if you are looking for full nonstop excitement then this is so much easier than wdw we love wdw and will go back again later this year being from e coast dl is harder to get to otherwise we would definitely have the annual pass totally worth it if you love disney ,5,2018-07-13
2373,Great fun,my family has been to walt disney world a few times but this was our first trip to the original park that started it all many people talk about how much smaller disneyland is than wdw but i didn t think so the rides seem to be closer together and they don t typically dump you into gift stores when you finish i enjoyed the different rides and the differences in the common rides i also felt that the character experience is better here probably because of the lower humidity we saw a wider variety of characters than in florida as well if you like thrill rides then you should probably stick with california adventure or universal studios use the disneyland app to make your fast passes and the play disney app to get through the lines that you can t fast pass you can also use the former app to mobile order food from a few dining locations we took advantage of that feature a number of times ,5,2018-07-12
2374,Very bad organising and management for an amazing product,the park is very nice amazing decoration easy walk between towns and can feel the good vibe out of visitors and people around however even if you bought the fast pass you still need to queue and not all rides have fast pass number of people inside the park is way higher than park capacity which lead you to queue for so long even if you have the fast pass whenever we ask about any service the only feedback been received was it is only for people who can afford it and very expensive whatever the situation is i must be the one to decide if i can afford and pay it and not ever to underestimate anyone financial ability it is my vacation and was wearing polo shirt and short shall i wear a suit and tie to impress the team and offer me services on time of fireworks we weren t able to see it as team was only trying to move all people in the park to a very small designated area which is impossible to hold all people thus managed to have a good spot to see the show before one of the team came and asked us to leave i very arrogant and offended way to avoid any situation in our vacation we moved forward but the worst out of it that in less the minutes we saw other people standing in the same spot and no one was talking to them won t be recommended to any city visitor and doesn t worth to spend a day with park current management and situation,2,2018-07-12
2375,We had a good time,we had a good time except we didn t pay the extra money to get fast passes and waited for over an hour to ride on splash mountain with a six year old they need to let more people that have waited in line on the rides ,4,2018-07-12
2376,"I'm a Disney World pro, but LOVE Disneyland!!",we live in southeast georgia and go to disney world frequently i recently completed treatment for breast cancer and a trip to la disneyland and the grand canyon was my reward i am already a disney fan but i was not prepared for how much i was going to love disneyland we had a fantastic time we had only planned on two days in the parks but added another day because we loved it so much we stayed at the castle inn an suites and walked to the park each day about a minute walk we also opted for max pass and it is the way to go we easily rode everything we wanted to during our trip and we rode many things more than once i love the old dark rides that are no longer at wdw like mr toad and snow white s scary adventure plus the other rides like pinocchio alice and storybook boats we loved the matterhorn too although the park is smaller than the magic kingdom i actually preferred it pirates space mountain big thunder and it s a small world are better in dl than the wdw versions in my opinion the cast members were all so friendly and laid back i loved the fact that the characters just stroll around the park like wdw in the old days when i was a kid so magical can t wait to come back wish it was not so far away from us miss you disneyland thanks for making my end of cancer journey such a great and magical experience for both me and my family next time i want to stay at the disneyland hotel for the experience maybe that can be my year survivor trip can t wait for that day ,5,2018-07-12
2377,Classic Magic,first i must start by saying comparing disneyland to disneyworld is like comparing the grand canyon to new york city two different experiences this is the original and its the classic it has a magic all its own and its worth a day destination in its own right ,5,2018-07-12
2378,Family vacation,awesome we loved it the haunted mansion wasn t that scary enough and the pirates of carribbean had changed a bit t s a small world is about mins ride you must check out these rides if you are from international tourists you will have a lot of fun ,5,2018-07-12
2379,Have Easily Frightened Children?!,are your children sensitive to frightening images and sounds ours are as such we wish we had researched scary rides before we went so we would know which to avoid our kids are and both sensitive to scary things my definition of scary is dark and evil as in witches and spooky creatures and ghosts etc not adrenaline boosting thrill seeker rides here s the list of rides shows that my kids either disliked because of the scary factor or caused them to cry and be very frightened i m talking nightmares here snow white very dark lots of scenes with the witch pinocchio also very dark with lots of spooky scenes aurora s castle walk through dark many images and sounds that frightened my kids including the witch and her cackling voice matterhorn bobsleds this ride has changed over the years it now includes incredibly loud background noises of ferocious yetis chasing you and growling at you as well as accompanying real looking images of the yeti monsters chasing you my son hated it pirates of the caribbean my eldest was ok but my youngest disliked it because of the darkness spooky sounds skeletons and scary looking pirates indiana jones dark loud scary images like glowing idol eyes and a large boulder coming straight at you and other frightening images sounds fantasmic show i would never show this to young children plot mickey is in charge of his dreams imagination until a witch takes over and turns all his dreams into a nightmare there is about a minute stretch of video scenes projected onto the water mist that are all the witches monsters villains from the animated films trying to make mickey s dream horrific including a satan looking demon character they are laughing maniacally and cackling and threatening the powers of darkness etc left my eldest in tears and asking to go home big thumbs down on this show apparently the world of colour show that my brother and his family watched was much brighter and happier there s a long list of great rides for young children too but i ve included all the above warnings for those travelling with young easily frightened children so that they can avoid the tears and pleas to go home that we heard some of my children s favourites in disneyland it s a small world the carousel thunder mountain railroad the rollercoaster in toon town forgot its name the disney train that goes around the park the jungle cruise boat tour buzz lightyear blaster ride my youngest didn t enjoy some of the scary robots dumbo and splash mountain we re closed though i m sure they would have liked those and in california adventure grizzly rapids monsters inc ride all cars land rides chew chew s caterpillar ride and all the other rides in a bug s life land the little mermaid although she covered her eyes ears through the ursula scene goofy s flight school hope you enjoy your disney vacation and can edit out any rides that may frighten your children ,4,2018-07-11
2380,Not doing well today,been in orlando and paris rides breaking down on a regular basis this is are second time and our last weather great people great,2,2018-07-11
2381,Great visit,we had such a great time at disneyland it was really crowded but they have everything running so efficiently that we were able to do most of what we wanted to ,4,2018-07-11
2382,Convenient!,perfect for us two night stay no shuttle needed but still a min walk nice breakfast parking was convenient would definitely go back ,5,2018-07-11
2383,Super awesome,i went on a thursday so it wasnt too crowded the only downside was the studio tour finale was broken when we went through ,5,2018-07-11
2384,PRICE gouging. Rides constantly closed,price is way too high rides are constantly closed down nemo or closing while in line star wars hyperspace if you have to pay over each children included give us our worth ,3,2018-07-11
2385,Disney Through New Eyes,no surprise as to how much fun can be had at disney what was special and worth sharing about this trip was the subtle ways in which disney made efforts to accommodate the little kiddos such as my month old daughter seeing the experience via her was as a result far more meaningful than any of the previous trips i ve made to the theme park without her changing stations in every bathroom yes it s law but they were all clean well kept and easily accessible water clean and potable can be found everywhere it was over degrees and keeping the kids hydrated was nothing short of a priority thankfully the park made this a non issue because of the availability of water all the vendors were happy to offer ice as well free whenever we needed some for our drinks or our water fan i expected attitude but i received nothing but smiles and helpfulness navigating the park with a stroller was a breeze lots of access and parking locations can be found very well thought out space to sit to eat and to take a break with shade as a solo adult it s easy to find a place to park your butt but with a kid and a stroller and what seems like a ton of gear it s not always so easy at disney however it s easy as much of the park experience as the rides themselves finally the fast pass situation is a game changer with kids lacking attention spans it s hard to get more than a few rides in through the day but the fast pass options makes the entire park way more available and is worth every penny it was a great memory ,5,2018-07-11
2386,Lots of fun,great fun definitely get the max pass and use the fast passes we got through most rides with the best ones multiple times in one day,5,2018-07-11
2387,experience,it was hot but still fun we didn t go on every ride tho because the lines were too long loved splash mountain tho ,5,2018-07-11
2388,Go early!!,we travelled down for a day visit from la and left l a at around am to miss the main la morning work traffic worked a treat as arrived at the park at about am park opens at am and there was already plenty of people there we paid for parking there a day or for priority parking we paid the for priority and can highly recommend the extra if you re driving you get sent to a dedicated floor in car park where you are right next to trams only a elevator away and when returning at end of day the tram drops you off right at bottom of lift door to door service we got straight on first tram going to the park and got in easily with little queuing at about the park was busy but quiet enough could get on rides easily we d done most of the park by pm when it was getting really busy we had a yr old so limited to rides but she enjoyed the carousel it s a small world boat ride dumbo ride it s a bugs life entire area and toon town she also adored meeting elsa and anna at pixar fest if you re planning on going on the bigger rides a fast pass is well worth it however we purchased one and it s almost pointless with a yr old because can t be used on any of the small kids rides strollers also available to hire from right at front gates we took our own stroller and felt very safe leaving it in the stroller parks nx to each ride i would highly recommend downloading the disneyland app it s great for maps information preordering food etc also if you re going on a hot day take hats cover of some description not much shade around the park and no through breeze so gets very hot ,5,2018-07-11
2389,Had a great trip!,i this was our first trip in over years our kids ranged from we got the maxpass and it worked great fast passes were available every minutes we slipped in a few of the lesser rides between fast passes which worked well for us even the busiest day in july was a lot of fun and the rest of the days seemed to have enough space and time to keep us busy and we loved the dole whips and dole whip floats the frozen lemon blue raspberry parfaits at california adventure were pretty good but somewhat overrated and not worth the minutes i had to wait in line pick one up on the pier if the line is short my year old son really liked his salad at the mexican restaurant in california adventure and i really liked my clam chowder bread bowl at the sour dough restaurant the sandwiches were just ok we will likely be going back next year the multi day passes are a big enough discount for the additional days that if you have the time it makes the park more enjoyable since you can leave when you are tired and come back the next day to finish up ,5,2018-07-11
2390,Vacation,had a great time with family all of the rides were amazing and the fireworks at night were absolutely amazing we all had a lot of fun,5,2018-07-11
2391,"Old school vintage vibe, awesome water parade!",having gone to disneyworld we think all other disneylands kind of start to pale in comparison california however had an interesting old school vibe that we did not get at disneyworld though it was really nice walking along the main streets even the ones open to public outside queues for rides were long but with the fastpass we managed to get on most rides without much hassle we were very impressed with the night parade on the river get a fastpass for this so you can be in the heart of the action it was a really unique experience you d never get at any other disneyland the characters were parading in boats that were in the water along there was a laser show using water sprays as a backdrop and of course pyrotechnics we absolutely loved it we also had a fun time with character breakfast at the plaza inn met some characters we usually do not see at other parks gepetto captain hook etc do note that the park does not allow selfie or gopro sticks they will throw it away they also did not offer a place to help you keep the items so we had to walk half an hour back just to place our gopro stick back in the hotel ,4,2018-07-10
2392,Disneyland '18,had a day park hopper pass we were at disneyland for the th of july which made it extra special there were a few ride issues during our visit but overall we had a great experience this was the first visit for our yr old yr old they thoroughly enjoyed it wish we would have got a th day instead of wasting a day going to universal studios where we only stayed for just over hours oh well we know next time to keep our focus on disneyland california adventure can t wait to return ,5,2018-07-10
2393,Would love to know where all these great reviews went to Disneyland,the place is a dump compared to some other places i ve been to entering disneyland i felt like they were leading a bunch of sheep to the slaughter house the whole front entrance smelled like a toilet for homeless people the entrance to the park is very lame there are dull colours everywhere you look it honestly looks like they havent been updated in years don t know where people get the happiest place on earth vibe from should be renamed the greediest prices for the simplest things are outrageous half of the staff spent the day daydreaming although i can understand why being paid peanuts you give peanuts frontier land and adventure land smell like a middle of stale swamp where water hasnt flown in years actually there are couple of places around the park that smelled like and outdoor toilet the little water they had was filled with trash there was also no shaded areas for people while waiting in huuuuuge lines in the strong heat probably to dehidrate them so they can spend money on cold drinks the tap water is some of the worst and most disgusting i have ever drank apparently having couple billion dollars profit a year is not enough to provide filtered cold water taps for people around the park but they can shoot out fireworks every night never in my life have i felt so ripped off and dissapointed as much as i ve been at disneyland maxpass maxtrash should be called using this service i felt like i was waiting in la traffic for it to start working i cant beleive they charge people to beta test this crap most rides felt dull and cheap using dark everywhere the could ao they wouldnt need to invest into some real rides go check out universal stuidos rides you will see the difference ps good thing was space mountain amd fantasmic show,1,2018-07-10
2394,Happiest Place for Sure,the good it s disneyland and everyone is happy and loving their time there is a lot to see in your travels memorabilia characters amazing gardens and lots of food the not so good the crowds are massive the wait times can swing from min to min even min this means without a multi day pass and a lot of money you may not see everything even with the fast pass system its difficult to get to see and experience everything the night time spectacular is off the charts but you do fight a lot of people in the crowds we paid the extra to view from a balcony which was good but you miss most of the show,5,2018-07-10
2395,AMAZING,well worth the cost a brilliant day out i would recommend days at least as there are parks and a lot of walking ,5,2018-07-10
2396,Family vacation,had a great time we took our son when he was four years old and then again at twelve he had a lot more fun ,5,2018-07-10
2397,Girls Weekend,can be expensive but had a blast definitely do a park hopper and fastpass spent the whole day in park sun up to sun down ,4,2018-07-09
2398,Fun!,a good variety of activities for all ages the fast pass is a must to avoid the long lines a number of attractions are getting worn fireworks are great ,4,2018-07-09
2399,Smaller than Disney World but the funs as big!,many rides by the same name have different little nuances the characters remind me of disney world years ago they mingle through the park and interact with guests it was magical ,5,2018-07-09
2400,FIVE DECADES OF DISNEYLAND - NO MORE.,we were still in the s when our parents first took us to the happiest place on earth since becoming an adult each visit becomes more about standing in line and less about happiness and fun unless you go accompanied by a great conversationalist even the little ones complain about standing in the sun for an hour just to enjoy a few minutes of delight the park would do well to limit the number of visitors allowed into the park so that all could actually enjoy the attractions ,3,2018-07-09
2401,2 days at Disney!,after a volleyball tournament we decided to do two days at disney thank goodness we beat the heat before it came to cali we all had a blast until next time ,5,2018-07-09
2402,ok for kids,we didnt enjoy ourselves at all very much a place for kids not us oldies we did how ever enjoy the restaurants so many people and so much to do it overwhelmed us i think ,3,2018-07-09
2403,Best Family Vacation,even though we were there on the hottest day of the year the staff was spectacular and our family had a magic disney time ,5,2018-07-09
2404,Disneyland !!,at first we came because we wanted to go for scary rides but once we arrived there and played around for some time we found that most of the rides give no adrenaline rush they felt so dull only several rides made us screamed and laughed indiana jones was one we rode it twice and it was still thrilling even at the second time however despite the not so thrilling rides we took a lot of pictures because everything was pretty there disneyland castle the flower beds the parades were all beautiful the shops and cafes were all prettily decorated the souvenirs made you spent a lot of dollars because everything is cute finally we spent like almost of our time there taking pictures snack ing and watching parade rather than enjoying the rides ha ,4,2018-07-09
2405,Plan!,you will definitely want to plan out your day and make the most of it by getting there early and if possible using an extra magic hour to get some more time use fastpass we paid extra for maxpass and for a small party two of us it was worth it but i can see where it can be cost prohibitive for larger parties be sure to allot enough time to park your car go through security and get into the park don t arrive at and think you re getting in at go minutes earlier than when you want to be inside even earlier on busier days if you re staying at a disney resort or even a nearby hotel on harbor blvd or katella ave consider taking a break if your hotel is a bit further away or you re a local and don t already know this you can also visit the disney hotel restaurants bars for a break in addition to those in downtown disney make sure you pay attention to showtimes or special hours for certain attractions i e the sailing ship columbia as they don t operate the entire time the park is open ,5,2018-07-09
2406,IS there anything better?,well for us there is no place we would rather be vacationing we love the rides and the shows and just hanging out in the castle don t miss the fantasyland theater right next to it s a small world the shows are amazing of course we love the rides everyone has their favorites pirates indiana jones cars etc and if youare wanting to do a character dining experience the plaza inn is the best lots of characters and great atmosphere and food can t go wrong have a magical trip ,5,2018-07-09
2407,Always love Disney!,it s worth it to get the max pass great pictures and better access to rides you can get free cups of water at most restaurants in the park good way to stay hydrated ,5,2018-07-09
2408,Fun time by all!,it was my six and eight year olds first time visiting disneyland we use the max pass on my phone so they had the opportunity to get on a lot of rides some more than once they also loved seeing all the different characters ,4,2018-07-09
2409,It is the happiest place on earth,we love disneyland the staff are friendly the rides are amazing and very kid friendly and there are so many food choices around the park we will be back again can t wait ,5,2018-07-09
2410,Excellent customer service on a special day / photo supply co,i would like to congratulate deanna of photo supply co who supported us at all times in a problem we had on a special day with an excellent ability she took time to help us when no one asked her and that little detail made us enjoy the park in the best way more people like her not only in disneyland but in all the companies where the quality service customer is the main thing thank you very much deanna i hope you recognize your great work i especially do it by these means ,5,2018-07-09
2411,Happiest place on earth,i ve been there many many times from when i was a little girl joining the mickey mouse club years ago to taking my kids there to going alone so that i could enjoy unhampered sometimes the park is reserved for an organization and you can buy tickets from scalper types for a pretty good deal or at least that was true in the s ,5,2018-07-09
2412,One day is not enough!,it has been years since i last visited so i felt one day was would be enough thoroughly enjoyed our visit despite the fact that we had miscalculated and the kids were already on vacation so it was very busy despite that we still saw a lot admission was usd,4,2018-07-09
2413,Fine for Small Children,i had grandchildren to entertain and we managed against the crowds to accomplish a few things they loved ,4,2018-07-09
2414,Disney Does It Right!,what can i say i m a lifelong disneyland fan and it never gets old disney always makes sure that the parks are clean safe and that no one ever has a bad time after all it s the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-07-09
2415,Family Vacation,recommend early when it s cooler the summer months can be hot with lines fairly long even enjoy the night time when it s cooler,5,2018-07-09
2416,Husband's birthday,we grew up in so cal going to this park maybe we were comparing it to old feelings about it but it s not what it was they used to pride themselves on the cleanliness of grounds and employees we saw a number of people with faded untucked uniforms trash on ground not being picky trust me this place used to be spotless the buildings are rundown with peeling paint etc we have many friends who still love it and go often but we don t need to go back,2,2018-07-09
2417,Get the MaxPass, a ticket was worth the ability to skip lines and unlimited photos to download loved indiana jones ride and wandering ,4,2018-07-09
2418,Happiest Place on Earth,super crowded due to non blackout date for pass holders but still a wonderful day lots of long lines but i bought max pass so i was able to plan around the lines rides are in great condition and park is very clean highly recommend ,5,2018-07-09
2419,THIS WAS A JOKE!!!,we visited disneyland anaheim resort in june we paid a good price for two adults and one pre teen the park was not crowded the parking was done quickly but most of the main rides were closed disneyland really needs to get it together ,2,2018-07-09
2420,Better plan your route beforehand.,if possible avoid peak season days we visited the park on a weekday and the general waiting time was manageable but we missed the parade ,5,2018-07-09
2421,Incredible,had one of the best days of my life something for all ages the attention to detail everywhere was incredible as was the night light show and fire works my personal favourite rides were indiana jones and the haunted mansion but my husband and other daughter loved the roller coaster around the mountain would have loved to go on the paddle steamer but we got there at pm and it has already closed which was a shame i loved the new orleans themed area and we had dinner at the blue bileu which was fantastic and i wound highly recommend it try the lousiana lemonade i managed hours of walking which is incredible and says a lot about how much fun we had wear comfy shoes and prepare for a big day of walking for a truly magical experience ,5,2018-07-09
2422,It is Magical...but,there is and never will be anywhere like disneyland it is magical and unreal but like our highways and neighborhoods disneyland has run out of space the population has grown and the space on main street has not if you want to watch a show or parade you fins yourself being escorted right off the street and into frontier land and can t get back there are just more and more people and no where for everyone to stand or sit disneyland has been outgrown by the crowds it has no place to expand so everyone gets a chance to see their shows demand has overpowered the supply we tried for nights to really see the pixar fest show and each time we ended up getting swooped up and out in the crowd and pushed into frontier land all you keep hearing is keep moving keep moving then after the shows the same thing you get swept up and out there are just too many people and no updating on space it is frustrating and exhausting ,4,2018-07-09
2423,Fun,disneyland is such a fun place to visit with either family or friends love going when it s decorated during the holidays there is something for everyone to enjoy ,5,2018-07-09
2424,Awesome first visit,on our first visit as a family of we were definitely overwhelmed what we did do was amazing do the character breakfast our kids loved it there is a mexican restaurant near the castle it smells good but don t waste your money we were disappointed but all in all the experience was a good one and will visit again ,4,2018-07-08
2425,LOVE,i am obsessed with disneyland we go about two times a year this year was especially great because i got engaged at the park i went over the fourth of july and actually had some of the shortest wait times i have ever had ,5,2018-07-08
2426,Severely mistreated at Disneyland Anaheim,today i was severely mistreated while entering disneyland with an e cigarette that security threatened to confiscate and not let me return into the park forcing me to surrender legal juul pods and device you can buy at the first cast member asked me if it s medically necessary as a registered nurse i said automatically said yes she proceeded to tell me they will confiscate my device so i walked away came back and the second cast member asked what d i do with it i said i threw it out he then screamed at me pointing at me following me threatening for me to get it out of the garbage out of the garbage i ran away telling him to back off went back and the sheriff proceeded to me and said i had to surrender my legal juul e cigarette and they will throw it away they will not return it he threatened me saying i will not be allowed to return into the park took the device and pods i explained it was just nicotine sold at showed the website and that they let people with cigarettes and lighters in the park he took a picture of my driver s license and park ticket he eventually gave me back the device and later realized the pods were legally just nicotine gave those back too i m very very disappointed in the mistreatment multiple threats and harassment at disney security as if this was a vape with cbd oil it s not there are smoking areas in the park for crying out loud this is my th day out of days if it weren t for my year old son in a stroller i d never come back to this place again a waste of an hour of my time ,1,2018-07-08
2427,Very disappointing compared to DisneyWorld,we have been to disney world several times and have also been on several disney cruise so when in anaheim we had to go here i know it s the original and was pumped after reading reviews i found it small old and lacking the disney magic we experienced with other disney vacations i was expecting what we d encountered previously but that s not what we got it was almost like any other amusement park i m glad we went for the experience but next time we will be going back to florida ,2,2018-07-08
2428,Truly the Happiest Place on Earth,i ve been going to disneyland since the s and it has changed quite a bit but only gotten better it s crowded and busy but always a great time get the flex pass so you can get advance tickets for some rides you need to know how to work the system you re never too old to enjoy it ,5,2018-07-08
2429,Enjoyed the originality of the park,the park really needs to work on dealing with increased speed of entrance into the park on peak days of vacation season especially holidays such as july th also need more buses running on these days nights a way to purchase reserved seating during the fireworks parades would be especially helpful too making magic bands available would be extremely helpful and would speed entry time and ease of using fast passes up for everyone adding perks for folks staying at a disney neighborhood approved hotel would be appreciated greatly even if it was something as simple as shuttle pickup between park hotel ,4,2018-07-08
2430,Family holiday,come early to avoid the crowds lots to do for everyone and staff are super friendly but beware of roped off photo areas do the night light shows they are amazing ,5,2018-07-08
2431,Disappointed,not very well organised hard to find the restrooms hard to find bubblers very very expensive very disappointed probably because we went to universal studios first and they were great it is nice to go to disney once but since it is our th time we are done ,2,2018-07-07
2432,The park was so fun,disney land never get old even when you are years old the park has so many rides to ride and there are fun treats and shop all in the park slash mountain was so much fun if you do not want to go very wet you will sit in the seats and if you want to get water you will sit in and ,5,2018-07-07
2433,Lived up to out expectations but expensive....,it was our first visit to los angeles and the park the whole family spend two days to be able to experience and see everything it pays to arrive as early as possible so as to avoid the crowd with young children some annoying parts were that despite spending the extra for fast passes we were still restricted in term of timing when you could use these passes some queuing were rather long and in the burning sun so you better be prepared with suntan lotions and water there is plenty for the young and less young to have fun but plan ahead your visit to make the most of it ,4,2018-07-07
2434,First time visitors,went here for the first time it was on a degree day and the park was not too crowded wait times were minutes at most all employees were super friendly and it was so cool to see all the original classic rides we tried the dole whip that everyone raves about and we became believers prices on food were not bad at all better than six flags the day could not have been better we had such a fun time ,5,2018-07-07
2435,Great time with the Ohana,i ve been going to disneyland since and i ve never been disappointed sure it s expensive sure it can be crowded the food and drinks are spendy but this is all known ahead of time today it was degrees which is almost unheard of in anaheim so it was a bit uncomfortable and some rides were closed because it was too hot for the equipment such as the monorail and the matterhorn the good news is nobody was there because it was so hot so we were able to go on lots of rides without even getting a fast pass if you don t mind crowds and your wallet is deep then there s no place like disneyland the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-07-07
2436,Horrible cast member experience,we had an amazing time as usual at disneyland we go about once a month i did want to point out an experience we had with carlos on the finding nemo ride on july my brother and i were talking and as we were boarding the sub carlos began to mock me and stated we can continue our teenage gossip in the sub i am and nowhere near a teenager we were both caught off guard and dumbfounded i told him that i am actually and he looked at my brother in a sarcastic tone and said oh so you must be i i felt that he completely discriminated against me because i was a female and because i look young i am honestly in shock that a person like this would be employed by disney his behavior was completely inappropriate me and my family are annual pass holders and have never been treated this way until now this is the reason for my rating ,3,2018-07-06
2437,The Happiest Place On Earth?,i bet it was back in the day when walter disney envisioned it and created it after abc bought it it seems like the morals have slid downhill i pine for the days of good old family values,5,2018-07-06
2438,Got the park hopper pass but stayed most of the day in Disneyland.,sooo much to see fun if you love the original disney characters or crave the newer attractions everything is top notch sure to please all ages,5,2018-07-06
2439,Waste of money,we were on our way home with our nine year old granddaughter we had spent the past two weeks exploring the national parks in utah and arizona since disneyland was a few hundred miles away we decided to take our granddaughter to disneyland since she had never been there took about an hour to get through the parking garage line got to the gate and it cost for two adults and one child regular pass if you wanted a fast pass to go ahead of other paying customers it cost more a seventy minute wait was not uncommon for most of the rides the rides were also malfunctioning while people were waiting they would be down for an hour or more they have a boutique for little girls parents can buy disney dresses and have the child s hair done the princess dresses were no we did not purchase one when the light show started if you were not inside the roped off space you were told to keep walking i m sorry but every person in the park was a paying customer they were essentially guiding you to the exits even though the park was not closed we will not be returning i doubt the experience was what walt disney had envisioned when he built the park two thumbs down ,1,2018-07-06
2440,MaxPass,get the maxpass stack your rides the app worked great it was really crowded when we were there and it was annoying at times however we were prepared and used the maxpass and took breaks back to our onsite hotel favorite rides indiana jones big thunder mountain pirates of the caribbean haunted mansion best food everything in new orleans square carnation cafe as a family of we enjoyed disneyland more than disney world because of better cast members better food better weather maxpass ,5,2018-07-06
2441,Fourth of July,came to see the amazing fireworks for the th purchased a twilight pass for pm til we were worried it would be too crowded but got in without any issues a big tip to those coming on the th get your spot early to see fireworks disney fails to warn you that if you do not get your spot by pm behind a roped in area you are basically jipped to see the show cast members will hurd you along the walkway like cattle not allowing you to watch the fireworks we felt a bit mislead and thought it was kind of a rip off for what we spent to be there for the fireworks you weren t even allowed to watch them if you weren t in roped in area the crowds definitely increased towards the showtime also disneyland is small and not disneyworld by any standards kind of disappointing ,2,2018-07-06
2442,Disneyland is perfect day out,everything was perfect during the visit my only disappointment was pixar fest just a communication campaign my kids was disappointing not seen any characters ,4,2018-07-06
2443,Magic,best park ever in love with every single detail beautiful park and super clean all the time you can breathe happiness there i recommend the fast pass super useful ,5,2018-07-06
2444,Fast day trip,yep we did a day trip to disney yes the lines can be long in the summer waited almost hours to get through security then to get our tickets the food may be a little pricey but who cares disney is freaking awesome everything is first class definitely download the disneyland app scan all your tickets and pay the per person to do the fast passes it is correct that you can not get all your fast passes at once bc everyone would be doing it you can see where characters are wait times for rides order food and download the pics that are taken at the end of many of the rides be sure to capture the number on your pic so you can download maybe standing in line for an hr talk with the ppl get a tan enjoy life a little ppl definitely coming back hopefully sooner than later ,5,2018-07-05
2445,1st visit with my family,kids absolutely enjoyed it we went july rd thinking it would be packed but it was enjoyable my youngest couldn t ride the indiana jones but we found the tarzan treehouse and jungle cruise near by and did that while we waited he loved the jungle cruise and the view from tarzan treehouse is amazing i wasn t very impressed with mickey s toontown the kids didn t have interest but to get on roller coasters the regular fast past was awesome we didn t pay for the max pass it s already expensive and you have to wait no matter what it s just part of the experience the most we waited was for minuets the disneyland app was a wonderful assistance ,5,2018-07-05
2446,Garbage,you pay extra for a fast pass but in actuality you can get one pass for one ride which indicates you to return at a specific time sounds fine right however you can only have one fast pass at a time in advance in other words you can only get one ticket at a time and then youd have to wait another hour before being able to get another one if the lines are ridiculously long which they likely will be you d still be waiting for your rides anyway it just saves you the waiting in line you end up waiting longer to ride by being able to walk around clearly outdated methodology at work here this place was a huge disappointment unless you re a huuuge disney fan or you have kids that love it this place is a waste of time and money it s an overpriced carnival disneyworld is way better and universal studios in cali blows this place out of the water ,1,2018-07-05
2447,Not exactly the happiest place on earth,we decided the take a family trip to disney for my daughters th birthday about two weeks ago i will start this review by saying i was the biggest fan of disney before this trip not so much anymore when you spend close to to get your family in somewhere not even for hotels planes etc you expect some service and politeness and this isn t what we received upon arrival we waited close to minutes to get in the park at a m on a tuesday morning which is suppose to be the slowest day of the week which is why we chose that day everyone in service in the park was rude or had a nasty face at gaston s lodge a woman taking orders was very nasty with my fianc about asking for a food removed from a burger a employee said to my daughter who asked was something free nothing here is free little girl my daughter purchased a autograph book to take pictures with disney themed characters and we saw total in the whole day till p m and told us they wouldn t do signings and the park reps told us they would sign if they wanted to the most disappointing to me is i tried taking a picture of or with storm troopers becuase star wars is my favorite movie and the kept intentionally moving outta the way whenever i tried to get a good shot i asked the park members walking with them if i could take a photo and again i was told they would take pictures if they wanted but they were taking pictures with people with park passes and good looking women i don t think this was a coincidence last but not least of the rides we rode broke down before we got to ride them and were told to come back later end of story lines were long food was bad and over priced rides didn t work park service sucked i m extremely disappointed in disney and unless they fix this for me and my family i won t be returning and telling everyone i know of this experience picture below of storm trooper intentionally turning when i was trying to take a picture with him ,2,2018-07-05
2448,Disneywirlwind,get prepared for this it is a mission mid summer visit and there was masses of people everywhere american sure know how to do lines everyone seemed polite and patient though the rides are fantastic such effort put into the themes really some where very impressive ,5,2018-07-05
2449,"If queuing and crowds make you happy, this truly is the happiest place on earth.",amazing park we kicked off with a queue for bag check then a queue for tickets then a queue to get in i was blown away by how busy it was like a packed shopping street at christmas everywhere you went the rides generally are fairly average its all the other entertainment that makes this place from the light spectacle to the usual characters for photos to the parades there was plenty to see we purchased the maxpass at per person its pretty good value especially as some of the queues were over minutes with the cars ride out to the maxpass allows you to use your app to jump the queue the catch is you can only book one ride at a time the more popular the ride the longer the wait to a get on the ride b book another ride for example we got to the park at am we could book the buzz lightyear attraction both not good or popular for am we then had to wait until am to book another ride the indiana jones ride good and popular couldn t be booked until pm it also meant we couldn t book another ride until pm the best advice is to book the popular rides first and accept the wait between bookings otherwise you may miss out on our day we could manage rides with the maxpass so we saved about hours in queuing for the older kids and preferred universal as did i with the young kids and mum preferring the shows and lights of disney ,4,2018-07-04
2450,"""Disney...the best""",it s disney so you know it is going to be great great rides great shows great fireworks and great atmosphere spend the extra a day per person and get the max pass it is definitely worth it when everyone else is waiting hours in a line for a ride you get to bypass those lines and go straight to the front you won t regret it just think instead of riding rides you can ride rides if you know how to work the fast passes ,5,2018-07-04
2451,Family of 6 US Trip,wow we loved it age groups were what a wonderful place we did a day hopper pass which included adventure park legoland and seaworld in san diego be sure to get the fast pass and because we stayed at the disneyland hotel we got early access every morning it was so worth it allowing us to get onto rides before the crowds came in our youngest at nearly i think we re just a little too young from i think the age of and up is the perfect age apart from that we absolutely loved disneyland ,5,2018-07-04
2452,"Great park, not great food",we love disney this was our first time to disneyland we loved the ease of the parks and how convenient it is to get from park to park the food was lacking in quality and portions compared to disneyworld we were disappointed in the food for the prices we paid max pass was fantastic not sure how we would have ridden everything we wanted without it definitely a great family get away just try to eat out of the parks for better quality food ,4,2018-07-04
2453,Happiest place on Earth,i want to live here nostalgia safety excitement endless fun we all know grew up with these characters the tie ins along with disney s storytelling attention to detail makes this place beyond amazing everybody has to see this place at least once in their life but for me i ll never get enough stars ,5,2018-07-04
2454,Big Day,we only had one day to do disneyland all the recommendations that tell you to be there early are correct we pre bought our tickets online and paid for the max pass and fast pass too the fast pass is so worth it it allows you to book your rides in advance and dodge the longer queues i cannot recommend this enough if you have one day i suggest you pick your preferred rides fast pass book them using the disney app and in between times get on the less popular rides of sneak in a bite to eat the main parade is popular so get your spot early about mins should be ok the fireworks at pm attract the largest crowd and you may need to get your spot a couple of hours early one person can stay in the spot while the others continue to do rides just swap around it s a big day but worth the effort and the preplanning will assist large groups will test your nerve so i suggest that if you are in a big group that you split up into smaller ones and maybe meet up for lunch just a thought ,5,2018-07-04
2455,It was really good,we spent days here and really enjoyed it we went during peak season so it was really busy fastpass is so worth it only extra per person per day and saves you so much time also download the app you ll be able to see the wait times for the rides food is pretty expensive and average the staff s attitude is great though everyone s in a good mood and friendly ,5,2018-07-04
2456,Birthday fun,road trip from new orleans to celebrate daughter birthday great park you can tell it was an original we walked to the park every day line for baggage check was long every day but that s typical great character meet and greet ,5,2018-07-03
2457,A day at Disney,we were at vid con and spent a day at disney to take a break from the convention it is smaller than disney world but still worth the trip you can do the whole park in one day disneyworld you need a full week ,5,2018-07-03
2458,Family Vacation,well of course disneyland is the happiest place on earth no matter the crowds and lines all of the visual stimulation and tiniest touches to make it like nowhere else in the world ,5,2018-07-03
2459,"As always, Disneyland was amazing.",my year old nephew and i had a great time you definitely need to buy multiple day park hopper tickets we found that the lines were not as bad as we had been told and in the two days we were even able to ride some of the rides twice ,5,2018-07-03
2460,Had a blast,had such a good time with my family although our overall trip was so so the amusement park more than made up for it ,4,2018-07-03
2461,The original Disney,amazing two different parks right next door to each over disneyland park and disney california adventure park i bought the hopper tickets allowing me access into both parks i got the one day pass which clearly wasn t enough time to see both parks big mistake but we still had fun i ve been to all of the disney parks in orlando florida disney world so i just wanted to experience the west coast version these two parks are action packed much smaller then the florida version but very concentrated and worth a visit or two it was definitely a flashback to my childhood seeing all these amazing characters and sharing the experience with the kids one woman asked me are you from london england i said yes she said have you been to disney paris i said no i like the sun we both laughed i advise get a day pass or day one if you can i also advise trying staying near the park in one of the many hotels as i lost a lot of the day by traveling from los angeles,5,2018-07-03
2462,Loved!,loved the compact park easy to navigate and ride lines moved quickly we were there am pm and never waited more than min for any ride thanks to fast pass app great experience ,5,2018-07-03
2463,"Second trip, still love it.",so much fun there s a variety of rides for everyone and don t forget the train it s also fun to walk around the shops i would recommend the jazz kitchen in downtown disney for a nice dinner ,5,2018-07-02
2464,Overcrowded,the park is overcrowded with not enough attractions to avoid waiting in queues of minutes the fastpass system is good but it is not explained to you when you buy your tickets so do research before visiting as you must use this process to have a more enjoyable visit ,4,2018-07-02
2465,Happiest Place on Earth,everyone loves disney right well disney land is a magical place that enables kids to be kids and adults to be less adulty almost every ride in this park is kid friendly the only exception being the indiana jones ride there are plenty of amazing things to see activities as well as a huge variety of places to eat my favorite thing in the entire park being the pineapple that they sell like spears and it is soooo good it s a great healthy snack for you your family or your friends to munch on while you re waiting in line for your next ride ,5,2018-07-02
2466,Amazing place,but try and avoid busy times like weekends tips it s totally worth paying the upgrade of maxpass to pre book select rides and skip the queues i felt sorry for people having to wait up to mins for some rides when we could walk to front of the queue in very little time the maxpass is controlled from iphone so easy to change times usually you can only book ride at a time or have to wait a certain amount of time before booking again also love the maxpass for photos so any disney photographer who takes your pic or on certain rides they scan your phone and it saves to your app and you can download so cool also totally worth buying a magic morning ticket enables you entry into park an hour before its open to the public still busy but no where near what it was at open do magic morning after having done at least one day in the park so you know where everything is located and what you really want to make sure you get in not every land is open but we managed to be efficient and squeeze in a lot in hour to avoid crowds for fantasmic it s probably worth getting the dining package at the hungry bear cheapest option and it allows you access to the preffered seating area be prepared for big big queues for security checks on the way into park and then again at entrance gates i think we took over an hour before we got in on our first day when we arrived at if you arrived prior to opening i think you are allowed to progress through all the checks and you stand behind a barrier until the park is officially open the crowds were manic ,5,2018-07-02
2467,Best Day Ever!,amazing place for the kids and the adults to let s be real dole whip is amazing all the shops nightlife etc of course it was disappointing that pirates was closed but these rides need work occasionally will continue to make disney a family tradition ,5,2018-07-01
2468,Wow!,can t say enough about the disney experience cast members go out of their way to make your trip magical the parks are exceptionally clean and disney keeps coming up with ways to limit the time guests spend waiting in line we visit every few years and have always been impressed that the trip is enjoyable for every age group ,5,2018-07-01
2469,Wasted $$$,though our family has had a few trips to disneyland in california our last trip was particularly a waste of time they allow way too many people access to the park at one time not only making for extremely long lines but near closing of the park nearing the fireworks show the park became so packed simply walking became an issue one would think this is a fire hazard should anything go wrong during your visit now i can see if you went as a couple large crowds may not be an issue but as a family of with small children just moving through the crowd and keeping track of your children is a task in itself making enjoying the park unachievable but as i started off saying my family and i have had many trips to this park not all were as bad as the last my advise enter at ur own risk,2,2018-07-01
2470,MaxPass is a must,as someone who grew up going to amusement parks and riding all of the roller coasters i appreciate short lines and the ability to ride as many rides as possible we were only able to do disneyland for one day and we opted for the maxpass having been to disney world and experiencing the fastpass system and the photopass costs maxpass is an amazing opportunity to save time and money you get to download any pictures taken by the park s photographers within days and you get to skip ahead in lines we were able to ride all of the most popular rides in one day and we never stood in line for more than minutes my favorite rides were splash mountain indiana jones and buzz lightyear astro blasters we also had hungry bear reservations for the fantasmic package i had seen this show at disney world and the disneyland fantasmic is better absolutely amazing and you should not miss it we were there on a monday in june and the park became totally packed by am and didn t seem to lessen until about pm there were strollers everywhere mostly parked if you do things at different times from other park goers then lines do seem to be shorter i recommend eating lunch and dinner early and you have more time for rides while everyone else is trying to grab food ,4,2018-07-01
2471,Lots of fun!!,my year old son and i really enjoyed our day here as well a at california adventure we bought the day park hopper ticket we have been to disney world in orlando several times and i will say that it is just not fair to compare the disney world is much bigger with more rides and activities but disneyland maintains an old fashioned charm that can t be beat i loved walking around knowing this was the original park where it all started be sure to take a picture with the walt disney mickey mouse statue i can also say that we both thought that this space mountain is much better than disney world s it s been awhile since we have been to florida but this one seemed much darker and faster we loved it take advantage of the single rider line on space mountain it s in a weird kind of hidden location at the exit to the line we saved a ton of time waiting by using the single rider line my other recommendation is to bring extra snacks and use a locker if necessary as expected food and drinks are pricey be sure to stay for the fireworks they are beautiful ,5,2018-07-01
2472,Not worth the money,everyone always talk about how amazing it would be to go to disneyland i wish i didn t waste my money to line up for an hour for each ride it would probably be better with kids to take them on rides but as an adult i wouldn t bother ,1,2018-07-01
2473,Wonderful park but incredibly crowded,we spent a week visiting disneyland and we definitely needed that long to be able to see everything the crowds when we visited were huge and we spent most of our time lining up so on average we only managed to get on three or four rides a day you seriously have to line up for everything from rides to food and drink toilets to take photos and anything else you want to do it got to the point where we just didn t bother going on rides more than once as lining up for an hour and a half just wasn t worth the two minute ride the park is very clean as were the amenities that is a credit to them the staff outside the park at the ticket booths were lovely and very friendly inside the park was a different story most of the staff were not very nice and not at all friendly it is an amazing place to visit and there is so much to see and do our family had a wonderful holiday here ,3,2018-07-01
2474,Loved it!,disneyland has rides characters music bands parades light shows window displays it is seriously the most fun place on earth ,5,2018-07-01
2475,Happiest place on earth,i love this place this was my first time going in at least five years we stayed at the park from am after midnight with some time in between to eat and go back to the hotel i am and went with a year old and year old we all loved splash mountain pirates and they loved space mountain yup i am too old for that one it used to be my favorite but way too many sharp turns and it made me dizzy there was this secret place that sold beignets in the shape of mickey so good and they were by the new orleans jazz festival at a place called mint julep i think it was the pineapple dole whip is worth the wait we loved the gift shops they had some way cool leather bracelets that we got engraved and super cheap i think each i think that was in frontierland we did get the maxpass and it s definitely worth the for it we couldn t get it until we entered the park download the disneyland app make sure your ticket is downloaded on there and you can check ride times on there once you get the maxpass you can upload all photos from the park on there this includes photos taken on the rides and with the characters you can also get fast passes on there and they allow you to get one every hours you can upload everyone s ticket to one phone so you could just scan one phone of the fast passes it made it so much easier we had lunch at the pizza planet and it was way overpriced food was ok and they did have pizza pasta and salads wear tennis shoes i wore converse with socks and had a huge blister on the back of my foot or comfy sandals but not ones that don t have a sturdy or comfy cushion especially if you stay there for a long time in tomorrowland you can build your own lightsaber so much fun and can t wait to go back there is something for everyone they even had a firework show parades throughout the day and several pixar shows at night after the shows the rides get super crowded an hour or longer sometimes but if you go on the rides during the shows like we did they were as short as min anyways we had so much fun worth the ticket ,5,2018-07-01
2476,Magical at it's best,walking into disneyland was truly a dream come true being an east coaster our family has always found disney world our magic place i always assumed disneyland was just a smaller version of disney world boy did i get that all wrong my take on disneyland would best be described as saying it s like having one foot in the past and one in the present which i recently learned is exactly how walt envisioned the experience i was invited to participate in a disneyland travel agent training boy did i obviously need to update my views on dl we stayed at the disneyland hotel frontier building which is just about an minute walk to the main gate of the park disneyland is set up in a very family friendly manner no need to pack up the strollers and children and board a bus if you stay on property which i would highly recommend the ease of entering the parks is truly worth every extra penny paid i also realized that although the names of the here might have you connecting to similar rides found at disney world the ride itself is not the same i love how disney planned out his parks to keep each unique in it s own way if you are considering disneyland don t think twice just do it if you need any help feel free to message me i ve gained a lot of inside info during my stay and am happy to share ,5,2018-06-30
2477,Love the original,max pass was great we re regular wdw visitors and only get to dl every few years it was a nice treat to ride the e ticket attractions multiple times in a day the park and entertainment are top notch the only con for me are the employees there are some amazing disney employees here but the majority are not it seems like the florida staff are happy to be there and carry out the magic whereas the majority of dl cast members are not their attitude really bring down the experience ,5,2018-06-30
2478,Best place on earth?,this park is amazingly clean and exhausting i kept mentioning to myself best place on earth but i couldn t convince myself of it between battling fatigued and cranky children to stop crying or to convince them that i had no more money to buy disney paraphernalia truely a memorable trip for both good and bad reasons ,4,2018-06-30
2479,Disney doesn't disappoint (DDD),i m a huge fan of disney the atmosphere is always exciting and magical the parades fireworks and events are second to none karyn,5,2018-06-30
2480,2018 Family Vacation celebrating a 40th birthday,best time ever except it was hot and loads of people they need more shaded areas and benches we popped for the maxpass for a person a day on our cells was perfect a must if you can,5,2018-06-30
2481,So much fun!,this is truly the happiest place on earth the theming of everything is so incredible all of the little details it has so much to do ,5,2018-06-30
2482,Fantastic Day in the sun,this was my third trip and i would say best the maxpass is a must as it made the fast pass process simple and efficient i probably took rides and in some cases three times star tours is updated and great enjoyed tiki room for first time excellent all around,5,2018-06-30
2483,Wonder Land,so happy to get there with the family we enjoy with all the places in it every thing very good i recommended,4,2018-06-30
2484,Magical! Always love visiting,love disneyland favorite place on earth we only wish there was benches in the long lines standing and waiting in lines with little kids is hard we utilize fast passes when possible but not all of the rides have those otherwise wouldn t change a thing except the cost it can add up especially with s family of like ours,5,2018-06-30
2485,So expensive,but i keep going back luckily get a little break on tickets through the military but it s still expensive i do wish i was still in southern california to take advantage of the season pass i think that would make a big difference all that said the park is always awesome all the attention to detail is amazing i did not think i would miss going to disneyland when i moved away from california ,5,2018-06-29
2486,Disney’s done it again!,being a massive disney fan i was very excited to visit the first disneyland we visited both california adventure and disneyland with a two day ticket not park hopper the tickets were expensive but it s disney so to be expected we didn t have to queue for anything for more than twenty minutes and took advantage of the fast pass and single rider lines in doing so we also liked that the ticket allowed us to exit and re enter the park on the same day we ate at downtown disney and returned for the evening parade as long as you re prepared for disney comfortable shoes aware that it may be crowded flexible about going on different rides etc then it s a great day out we didn t arrive at rope drop and didn t find the crowds too bad but visited on a thursday friday so weekends or school holidays may be quite different would reccomend visiting there s heaps to do if you want to spend a full day or two there ,5,2018-06-29
2487,Took my daughter,took my year old she was amazed loved it i even loved it we only went for one day didn t have a lot of time but it was well worth the visit the rides are eye catching we also done pin trading which was pretty cool make sure you do the pin trading it s fun not too boy for the kids but also for the adults we didn t stay near by so we paid to park got there and our line was min wait compared to the people who stayed at resort that line looked to be hours long ,5,2018-06-29
2488,Special experience but lines are horrible,loved getting to experience disneyland for the first time with my husband however we were extremely disappointed with the lines and the fact that no express passes were sold we paid for the park hopper fast passes for both disneyland and disney california adventure and only got to go on the guardians of the galaxy haunted mansion and star tours attraction the fast passes only help you reserve your spot at one ride at a time and often the rides get canceled so they move your times to another lines per ride often had minute waits and were packed i did like the photo feature in the fast pass though you get to take professional photos throughout the parks and immediately get them sent to your phone via the app also if you don t want to lose your selfie stick to gate checkers or have to navigate back to the parking lot make sure to leave your selfie sticks in the car as they are not allowed apparently ,4,2018-06-29
2489,Best when it's dark,i ve been to disney land several times and it s always fun even though it gets very crowded it s fun to experience at night and if you re somebody who isn t particularly interested in parades that is the best time to find short lines choose what side of main street you want to be on before the parade starts and you ll find that lines to the rides are much shorter with a large majority of people crowding to watch the parade utilize fast passes as much as possible during the day and go as early as you can because it only gets more crowded as midday approaches ,4,2018-06-28
2490,Well it is Disney!,been going since too many people and too long to stand in lines stayed at disneyland hotel so got in hour before the gates open this is the best time to hit the popular rides our year old granddaughter enjoyed is not so much i will wait till for the next visit,3,2018-06-28
2491,Great Visit,everyone knows the saying the happiest place on earth i remember as a kid that i loved going to disneyland park every year with my parents and running with my sister to get on all the rides now i get to share this same joy with my son it is priceless to see how much fun and his wonderful smile when we visited disneyland last week this was his th time to disney there is something about the parade the rides and the characters that all ages love this park we used the fast pass efficiently so it all worked out well we had a wonderful time and memories to last a life time ,5,2018-06-28
2492,WONDERFUL!!!,disneyland is wonderful no other way to describe it as first timers to disneyland a couple of recommendations to get the most out of your visit i do recommend planning your visit and getting to the park upon park opening this is when the park is least busy and you can get straight on the most popular rides also the max pass is fantastic definently worth the pp unlimited photos as well as minimal wait times on the most popular rides thank you disneyland can t wait to come back ,5,2018-06-28
2493,The Magic of Disney,st of all how can you not enjoy your time spent at disneyland but to make it even more memorable get disney s max fast pass it s per ticket per day but worth it it includes disney photos and reserving fast passes straight from your disneyland app once you reserve a fast pass it ll let you know when you can reserve another one we are breakfast lunch and dinner while visiting disneyland for multiple days and each experience was just what you d come to expect from disney magical but to offer some dining advice the hungry bear is a nice place for lunch galactic burger is a nice spot for dinner or lunch anywhere on main street is recommended for breakfast my favorite rides are still pirates of the caribbean haunted mansion splash mountain space mountain really though whatever you are doing at disney you will have an awesome time yes it was busy but reserve those fast passes and just enjoy the overall experience thank you walt disney for playing a magical role in my life and in the lives of my family ,5,2018-06-27
2494,Plan to wait over 80 minutes for the rides.,this was the most horrible time to go to disneyland the fast passes are only available every two hours make sure you don t mix up your ticket and leave the park as they won t let you back in with the wrong pic attached to the ticket they tack your picture when you go through entrance at am the wait time for cars ride was minutes we picked the fast pass for this ride at and the first opening was and we couldn t book another fast pass ride until after so disappointing we were there one day and barely got on rides ,1,2018-06-27
2495,Happy trip,i love going to disneyland it was a really nice adventure my family lives down there everything was great tge events shows all ,5,2018-06-27
2496,FABULOUS!!!,this was my fourth time at disneyland and i just adore that place the park is so clean the rides are so worth the wait and the food is just mouth watering disney really is built for families and young children they have stroller parking at every ride and the fast passes are a huge help i can t wait to go back to disneyland ,5,2018-06-27
2497,It really is the happiest place on earth!,what s not to like you will feel as though you stepped into a land away from home you won t think about anything else except where you are and how much fun your having i recommend you wait until your kids are at least so that they will get the full experience and build lasting memories ,5,2018-06-27
2498,A very Magical Trip within the Park at Disney. Many people having fun espicially kids with there parents.,it was very hot and humid this time of year in june would recommend early september would be better ,5,2018-06-27
2499,Crowded and confusing,the park is very crowded and very difficult to find your way around the printed maps and the app map are not clear enough and there are no signposts the fact that you can get a free fast pass for certain attractions is very helpful ,3,2018-06-27
2500,not a good experience,the line ups were crazy from security to the ticket booths to get in rides were impossible to get on with over a hour wait,1,2018-06-26
2501,Disneyland Magic,two day visit the maxpass feature is nice disneyland works a lot different that the fastpass in disney world use their app once in the park to find your attractions to ride not all rides are on the maxpass program i like the maxpass also for the photopass option all the photos that a disney photo character takes are able to be down loaded great feature ,4,2018-06-26
2502,Buyer Beware,check and double check the so cal blackout day schedule before you go the days that the so cal pass is not blacked out become unbearably crowded it happened to me they switched blackout dates after i reserved my hotel and you couldn t even move in the park they publish this blackout calendar on the website check back frequently and you will enjoy your trip much more on a so cal blackout date ,1,2018-06-26
2503,Don't Wait in Line,i love disneyland but i hate waiting in line so here are my tips for skipping the lines at disneyland go on a slightly off day christmas is forbidden and summer is no good unless you re a pro like me get there before the park opens get to the park when the parking structure mickey and friends opens about an hour before the park or check the website park then go to starbucks and get breakfast or bring breakfast so you can wait in the front of the park i know you probably feel like this is a waste of time the park isn t open and you still have to wait in a line but this is one line versus several i d rather wait in one minute line than when the gates open you still have to wait for rope drop but at least you are one of the first in and the sun hasn t begun to scorch your toes download the app before you get to the park the wifi is sketchy but the app usually works fine if its already on your phone study the app while you re in line or before you get to the park you are going to be spending a lot of money on this here trip don t waste time wandering around know where you re going and at least have an idea of what you re doing get the max pass for your entire party i know you just paid an arm and a leg to get in you ain t givin that mouse no more money but think of it this way you just paid an arm and a leg to get in what s another buck toenail the max pass pays off in spades once you get moving and when the rope drops you better get moving with the maxpass there is no need to divide and conquer dad can stay with the group instead of running hither and thither for fast passes do the most popular stuff first i always start in dca because the guardians line is redunkulous we usually do all of dca before am and then we hit up disneyland and we re done with the most popular stuff there by which is when all the crowds and strollers start showing up by that time we have our last maxpass for splash mountain around pm and we can eat and stroll around at our leisure figure out your schedule before you get there even if you have never been do a little research people my route is usually the same every time and i m not giving it up because it works for me you need to find what works for you and your fambam a little planning goes a long way at disney but be warned all the planning in the world cannot account for the fact that people love this park i ve got a pass so if i come on a day when everybody wants to be there i can try another day but if this is going to be your one and only disneyland trip for the foreseeable future then at least do the research and know before your go good luck and may the force be with you,5,2018-06-25
2504,Disney life hack for a long day at the park! You're welcome ;),what can i say that hasn t been said before how bout a disney life hack once you re there you ll notice that they rent out portable cell phone chargers for day whhatt hey it s disney after all and nothing is free or is it on my trip here last week i stumbled across the only wall plug in i found in the whole park so i could avoid paying the and just do a quick min charge it can be found on the right side of the street near the lockers as you re coming in the gate and passing all the little shops specifically it can be found on the wall of the painless dentist office not a real store across the path from starbucks real store so save your and bring your wall charger please upvote this comment if you found my review helpful from one disney fan to another enjoy ,5,2018-06-25
2505,"Enjoyed visit, get maxpass",what can you say typical disney maxpass for day well worth it we rode every ride we wanted were there just before pixar pier opened ,5,2018-06-25
2506,Home!,classic timeless amazing yes it can get crowded but do your homework and go during slow times we live several states away and make the trip at least once a year to never have to leave the magic stay on property ,5,2018-06-25
2507,Disneyland Anaheim,nice rides very clean as to be expected a great day for all i like the layout better than disneyworld and the architecture seems more inviting as with all the parks that offer it now i am not a fan of the paid linejumper policy everyone should wait there turn ,5,2018-06-25
2508,The wonderful land of Disney,had a great time with the family lots to see and do for all ages sizes and levels of adventurers from the laid back chill to the thrill seekers we mostly go to disney world in orlando and was skeptical about having fun in only two parks versus four parks all in all it was an enjoyable experience with fantastic weather we will definitely be going back in the near future ,5,2018-06-25
2509,Love Disney,love the park maxpass was worthy he per day for fast passes and photos food is pricey but good overall ,5,2018-06-25
2510,Wonderful Father’s Day!,we spent father s day at disneyland as a family and had a blast the max pass for fast passes is definitely worth the it costs in order to save time walking and maximize your ride riding ,5,2018-06-25
2511,"Been to Florida Disney 5 times, heard wasnt as good here... id say it def was!!!",first visit here june though times to florida disneyworld i was just going to embrace a different experience as id heard many say anaheim wasnt as good delighted to say that many times i forgot exactly where i was due to the similarities to some parts and dare i say it some things were actually a bit better prefer space mountain here and buzz lightyear loved the fact they have a pixar parade several rides different to florida and obv vice versa and that it was very much the disney feel but in a brand new envirnoment for us even prefer the old school getting a card for the fastpass machine i know they have fastpass from the phone now at an extra expense but we planned it well and just about rode all that was available without it hey the castle is not a patch on florida but its the original walt idea so you cant really change it the california adventure the other park here is as good as any park in florida absolutely great day there too absolutely delighted to have enjoyed our days here just as much as florida and would recommend to anyone ,5,2018-06-25
2512,The most magical place on earth!,came here with my teenager and her friend we had the time of our lives it was truly magical we loved all the attractions and shops thank you ,5,2018-06-25
2513,Beautiful but way too crowded.,i ve been to disneyland many times but my last trip was the most miserable the parks were so crowded that they ran out of parking and we had to park at downtown disney an hour we weren t able to get on any rides at all and we couldn t eat because everything was so packed this was on a wednesday afternoon and there was nothing special going on if you go be prepared to be there all day and night ,5,2018-06-24
2514,exciting,park is for families and many rides for all ages lots of good food only thing if you cant walk long period of time get a wheelchair at main gate,5,2018-06-24
2515,"Other than 1 issue, overall loved my time at Disneyland",i had waited years to go back to disneyland first time i was about this time i got to fulfill my promise and took my year old son we purchased the day park hopper this allows you to go between each of the disneyland and disney california adventure parks as often as you wish i purchased the tickets through expedia so i exchanged the expedia vouchers the night before we started our park visits so we could enjoy our first day there with the magic morning the disneyland ticket attendant was fabulous friendly and went out of her way to explain the magic morning and park hopper inclusions being us summer school holidays it was pretty busy and hot remember to pack water hats and sunscreen i would have loved if the fantasia ice cream was still available still remember how amazing it was when i had it as a child i would have given stars but gave as i had a rude encounter with a couple ride attendants for the matterhorn i waited in line minutes with my son and when we got to the ride attendants the couple in front of us were asked for their fast passes and told to go to another line around the other side of the matterhorn then the same happened to us the attendants were chatting to each other then when i said i didn t have a fast pass i was told in a rather rude tone this is the fast pass line go to the other side and line up i said to the attendant that all the other rides have attendants standing at the end if the fast pass lines to check for passes and direct patrons and there was no indication again the people ahead of us also didn t see anything saying fast pass i was then rudely told it says it on the sign well perhaps this is true but it was not clearly signed this encounter actually left me and my son feeling irritated and deflated after having so much fun the days prior hopefully no one else has thus experience as overall the rest of my time was wonderful ,4,2018-06-24
2516,Disney,always something new delightful must see if you have the cash go in the morning to avoid the huge crowds ,4,2018-06-24
2517,Love this park,amazing love this place omg it was amazing trip lines were it bad fast passes are free and u scan the ticket and it tells you when to come back to get in the fast pass line ,5,2018-06-24
2518,Classic Disney,we had a great time on our recent visit classic disney rides just with a bit of a smaller feel then disney world many of the rides here are the same though and it felt familiar but also nice to try out some of the different ones ,5,2018-06-24
2519,"What Can I say, Its the Original Disneyland",my wife and i were a little dubious about visiting disneyland as we are a couple of a certain age with our children all grown up we eventually convinced ourselves that we would regret it if we went home without visiting at least one of the disney parks considering that we were staying in a hotel within easy walking distance of both parks in anaheim all i can say is a we weren t the oldest nor only unaccompanied adults in the park not by a long shot and b we entered the park at around and before we knew it it was and we were still walking around with big silly grins on our faces after wondering whether it was worth it we left planning our next visit,5,2018-06-24
2520,family vacation,we had a great time in disneyland it wasn t as commercial as disney world and a bit more relaxing we enjoyed spending my sons birthday in cars section of the park since thats what he wanted to do for his birthday,5,2018-06-24
2521,Nice park,like all disney parks nice and clean and full of fun and somewhat overpriced very crowded i reccomend getting a fastpass to get past the long lines i like that it s not to big and can be covered in one day fireworks were a dissappointment compared to disney world ,4,2018-06-24
2522,One of the Annual Visits,the third week of june is one of our favorites as it isn t nearly as crowded as it will be the rest of the summer the new maxpass makes scheduling much easier especially if you have an annual pass ,5,2018-06-23
2523,First Visit,it s disneyland we had excellent weather and stayed close by a much different experience than in wdw but equally magic three day park hopper allowed us to do and see everything we wanted to ,5,2018-06-23
2524,Still the best!,i have been coming here for years and i still think it s the best park of its kind there is something for all ages and people the melting pot that is disney is impressive if you have hard core riders in your party definitely opt for maxpass where you get fastpass tide access and unlimited access to photos for the rides in the park it s usually crowded but that s because the park is compact i like the fact that you can see the whole ark without having to walk the long distances in the humidity like at disneyworld in orlando the way they keep the park spotless is amazing bathrooms are clean too food is tremendously overpriced and mediocre there s always parking but i like to stay at a nearby hotel and walk if characters are important you can make appointments to see them or you can approach them as they appear it s pretty easy to get a picture with the stormtroopers in tomorrow land you should always buy a silly hat my favorite rides are mr toad s wild ride space mountain the boat ride in adventureland pirates of the caribbean don t take easily scared kids and the haunted mansion they still have barbershop quartets roaming around and other artifacts of the original walt disney concept you have to watch the cartoon steamboat willy that started it all ,5,2018-06-23
2525,Most Unhappiness Place,everything is over outrageous pricing after disneyland profited billion in months very pathetic and controlled by greed walt disney created disneyland for families with family entertainment not for outrageous profit most families can t afford disneyland especially the disneyland hotel expensive dining passport admission popcorn snacks to say nothing of the pricing on gifts to bring home a simple disneyland weekend for nights in the grand disneyland hotel meals and days at the theme park absurd and ridiculous over at knotts a one year annual pass cost that s times less then a annual disneyland pass disneyland employees are earning less the an hour poverity level it s high time for a raise to an hour it s called a livable wage affordable family entertainment has lost it s magic at disneyland giving disneyland a generous star shame on disneyland greedy corporate misers ,1,2018-06-23
2526,Preparation is key,for you to really enjoy your time at disneyland you really must plan ahead preparation is key to a successful vacation i would recommend checking crowd calendars planning your day so that you skip the park with emh and visit the other one instead etc oh and if you can afford it max pass is worth it hands down utilize the lockers for snacks sweatshirts for the evening change of clothes if you go on water rides etc if you have little ones leave the park for a afternoon nap photo pass is a great add on purchase but cast members are happy to take your photo with your own camera too get a button at town hall if you are celebrating a special occasion don t leave without getting a dole whip get free ice water at quick service counters not restaurants and it s not bottled and most of all have fun disneybybrittany,5,2018-06-23
2527,Quick Disneyland California adventure getaway,several rides closed for renovations longer lines restaurant rides closed before park did should of gotten lower ticket costs,3,2018-06-22
2528,It's Disney!,disneyland is not disney world but then what is despite that i still enjoyed the day in the park there were a few rides that were being renovated and a few restaurants that weren t open it was march but i still got my money s worth there are a few rides there that aren t at dw and that makes it nice i really enjoyed the indiana jones ride and the matterhorn i like space mountain better at disneyland it s always a good day with disney ,4,2018-06-22
2529,Felt like a child again,last time i visited disneyland was wayback in now it s with three kids ages and disneyland is still the same as i remembered before great time to visit now weather is good but the lines to each ride is tediously long waiting time usually from minutes be prepared to stand under the sun so don t forget your caps and sunblocks ,4,2018-06-22
2530,All for the kids! Well worth the experience!,the kids loved it not cheap but worth it get up and go early and its a must to have the fast pass and run it from your mobile phone as it will save you so much time the crowds build throughout the day and i cannot believe how many people are there at night to watch the fireworks go early go hard and get out before the crowds get crazy ,4,2018-06-22
2531,15 miles of walking!,having visited wdw in florida and disneyland paris a stop at disneyland was a must for our year old son on our drive from san francisco to san diego it certainly wasn t a restful day lots of walking and people everywhere we spent hours in the park as we had to wait until for the guardians of the galaxy ride and then rush to the cars ride for the last trip of the day at pm both my husband and son said it was worth the wait for both rides though we had a one day hopper and left the park for some lunch and to have a rest from the crowds there are plenty of reasonable priced places to eat nearby ,5,2018-06-21
2532,Great family vacation,always fun and entertaining a lot of things to see and do so you need a couple days to check everything staff is attentive and friendly and a lot of good food ,5,2018-06-21
2533,I love this place!!!!!,my family had never had as much fun as when we visit disneyland park it is just like being a little kid again i recommend getting there as soon as the park opens to help avoid lines also this time we used the disney max pass app it was per person per day but it was worth it we hardly waited in any lines at all and instead of running across the park to get fast passes we could do it on our phones it was really easy it was also really hot the day we went so we had dole whips in the tiki room and it was a great way to cool off it was a magical experience i can t wait to do it again ,5,2018-06-21
2534,Always fun,rd visit to disneyland over the last years and it never fails to deliver great experiences we had a group of and the tream always accommodated our needs for the rides and attractions ,5,2018-06-21
2535,Not as good when you’re old,i remember going to disneyland when i was years old almost years later it s still the happiest place on earth albeit the fantasy wasn t as real this time around but i couldn t help but remember how i truly believed i was riding a flying ship on the peter pan ride wish i had my childhood imagination back it s a must visit when in southern california ,4,2018-06-21
2536,Amazing,amazing experience love disneyland every time clean and well maintained love the churros and dole pineapple treats ,5,2018-06-21
2537,It was awesome!,loved disneyland my family had a great time seeing old favorites in disneyland and exploring the california adventure side downtown disney was a great break in between the parks great restaurants and great services my favorite area was the hollywood side saw the aladdin show twice the hollywood tower was the best new ride the golden dreams show in the bay area was very moving only rides down were alice in wonderland and space mountain met all of the disney princesses and saw characters all day long awww ,5,2018-06-21
2538,Happiest Place to be,being raised mile from disneyland and going at least twice a year disneyland has changed some meaning rides but main street frontierland new orleans square tomorrowland fantasyland have not changed went with my grand daughters and we had a fantastic time enjoying the rides walking through all the lands even though it is crowded the experience is well worth it the cast members employees are always smiling we had a day hopper and did disneyland one day california adventure the next back to disneyland the third day ,5,2018-06-20
2539,Excellent customer service,nice place it looks magical it was a very nice experience i loved there good price food and service ,5,2018-06-20
2540,Magical,disneyland has been a vacation spot for our family for many years it just keeps getting better better we love the parades shows music food characters and of course the rides the park is kept so clean the restaurant food choices are vast make your dining reservations early the landscaping is gorgeous cast mates are friendly and willing to help we took advantage of the max pass combined with early morning entry from staying on property we were able to go on many rides quickly early in the day avoiding long lines but the crowds did come disney efficiently handles the vast amount of people comfortable shoes are a must as is sunscreen hat we were glad we brought portable phone chargers between using our phone for the disneyland app and taking tons of photos we needed to charge them up about the same time we had a late lunch oh and bring a ziplock bag in your backpack to store anything you don t want to get wet from the rides ,5,2018-06-20
2541,Best corn dogs crispy fried,hand dipped with thick corn batter to crispy perfection ketchup and mustard behind corn dog cart can buy corn dog separately and not with apple slices and drink,5,2018-06-20
2542,Disneyland first timers,we are with disney vacation club members and we visited disneyland for the first time there were things that were good about it as it is an old part which was what we expected though my husband did have an issue of a severe allergic reaction while we were there though i am a nurse and knew how to take care of it i was concerned about getting him all the way back to the room from the park and all i was offered was a security guard who walked us they re basically walking in front of us to make sure we got through the crowd a place like they should have some sort of transportation for someone who is having an emergency situation other than calling an ambulance,3,2018-06-20
2543,day pass with express,was a great day highly recommended getting the express pass to dodge waiting in line for hours if your only here for one day on holiday it s a must have ,4,2018-06-20
2544,Crowded,we got to the park at opening and was able to see most of the adventures before the park got crowded was able to use the fast passes to avoid lines after that it was crowded but we were able to see everything we wanted the only thing i was disappointed with was the nighttime fireworks they were terrible and not up to disney standards ,4,2018-06-20
2545,Original park...,we love wdw florida and have always really wanted to visit the original park it is wonderful much smaller than wdw and easily do able in one day but it was lovely as a disney fan to see some of the original rides and pieces of history there isn t as much here for a thrill ride junkie as wdw and some of the coasters are quite dated and shoogly but the atmosphere is pure disney magic i would recommend paying extra for the max pass fast pass it saved us a lot of running around dress comfortable and come armed with a game plan if you want to have an enjoyable day i would recommend bringing in a packed lunch as the restaurants in the park are often expensive crowded and not great food ,5,2018-06-20
2546,"Crowds, crowds, and more crowds!",we were visiting from fl and my wife wanted to see the original disneyland so we went on a monday thinking less crowded we went to california adventure first thank god had a great time there then went across the way to disney and experienced a crush of people like i ve never seen spent most of the afternoon just trying to get from one spot in the park to the next i m glad we went so my wife could check it off on the bucket list but we ll stick to the florida parks where you can actually see the street in front of you ,2,2018-06-20
2547,Very busy in June - try for fall,we had a nice visit seeing the parade fireworks and characters was the best part if you are crushed for time i would recommend skipping california adventure side the core disney stuff is all on disneyland side they were finalizing construction on parts of paradise pier so i cannot speak to what that will be like the best things on the california adventure side were soarin guardians of the galaxy and the cars world guardians of the galaxy is hollywood tower of terror redesigned updated it was the most thrilling ride in the whole park if you can skip these attractions it will save you money time and walking on the disneyland side you will find the traditional areas of disney frontier new orleans fantasyland main street and tomorrowland for a young child you can get a lot of cute pictures and a lot of rides in quickly at toontown and fantasyland areas the lines were minutes max for those the pixarfest show along with the fireworks was great that is at projected on the castle is you are staying at a hotel in the anaheim disney area you will probably be able to see them although disneyland was great if you are used to the disney world you will probably prefer that one there is no epcot or animal kingdom for starters florida is more open and spread out this park is smaller and more walkable but due to extreme june crowds and strollers it was really challenging to walk anywhere the perfect trip i hope to do again is days at disneyworld in october ,4,2018-06-20
2548,Best time in quite awhile,perfect weather crowds just right cast members all very professional helpful and fun great food ,5,2018-06-19
2549,Crazy!,my last time to visit to many people very high cost to attend admission for water for any meal approximate overworked staff i know it is disneyland but based on my observations not the most happy place in the world ,2,2018-06-19
2550,Not happy that may attractions were closed,disney is always great and i was excited to bring the th generation of my family to visit the park i was not happy that pirates of the caribbean was closed but was very upset when we decided to do the california adventure park and a large portion of this park was closed for renovations i wish they had told me this before i shelled out the extra fee for people to visit ,3,2018-06-19
2551,Even better than I thought!,i was so excited to visit disneyland for the first time i ve been to disney world probably times but always wanted to visit the original it was even better than i thought it would be many of the attractions were better there than at disney world and the fastpass system is much better too ,5,2018-06-19
2552,Just magic!!,everything is amazing about disneyland they sell you the all idea about the disney movies and characters since the moment you enter you are having this magical experience thousands of shops to buy souvenirs food snacks disney character all over the place willing to have a moment with you and take a picture with them recommendations take a backpack bring a bottle to refill it with water use sunscreen bring snacks with you because everything is expeeensive don t buy souvenirs at the beginning think about were and what to eat i had a salad in pizza planet and it was not the best decision of course i also had a slice of pizza ,5,2018-06-19
2553,Awesome Experience,love the layout of the park maxpass worked well for us thank you to the cast members at the ticket counter and city hall who helped give us a little disney magic when my app wouldn t let me purchase maxpass digitally we got comped even after offering to pay since the app was giving us so many issues they were so gracious thank you disneyland for a great time ,5,2018-06-19
2554,It’s had its day,nighttime best for apmosphere found it somewhat dated but for kids i could see they re happiness a little expensive ,3,2018-06-18
2555,Great Family Trip,before going use the internet for tips and download the disneyland app for navigating wait times and fast passes ,5,2018-06-18
2556,WOW! Disney Park!,buy your tickets online i wasted more than an hour for it when you get the map where ever fp fast pass is mentioned mark them do not miss those experience get you fast pass well in advance and start your day we covered almost everything except indiana jones which was closed due to technical issues for few hours just before the close of the park a memorable trip for us ,5,2018-06-18
2557,Disneyland La,overcrowded and oversold there is no point in putting more people in the park than it s capacity long wait times and endless lines no value for money,2,2018-06-18
2558,Amazing trip,we had an absolutely great time while not waiting in the hour long lines at every ride overall great experience and a must see for anyone around the world ,4,2018-06-18
2559,Family trip,awesome experience but to crowded long lines to wait for rides and no to good food still fun for my kids wich was the goal,4,2018-06-18
2560,Disneyland Adventure,we had not been to disneland in years we like wdw this visit was good and low in crowds monday we enjoyes remembering and comparing our chiledhood here ,4,2018-06-18
2561,disney is disney (research required),disney is disney as we all know the lines are long and excruciating they offer a fast pass but be advised to research this process before thinking its going to help you out you must plan hours ahead of when you want to go on these rides to use the fast pass with research it may be better ill take this one on operator error but kids had a blast of course it is still disney land drinks and food werent as pricy as we had prepared for so that was a nice surprise ,3,2018-06-18
2562,Great trip,i had given up on disneyland living in illinois disneyworld is about the same distance flight wise so given the space and variety or parks disneyworld was better choice having family in california every once in a while i chose to visit disneyland it is always overcrowded and packed with strollers that seem to always find my ankles and the back of my leg i took my three grandchildren last week the visit was a delight it was crowded but not crazy busy we visited on a thursday there were plenty of lockers to store our sweaters and purchases best part of the day was discovering the disneyland app and purchasing the fast pass addition to our tickets not once did we wait more than minutes for a ride i was also able to view wait times on rides so i could choose which rides to just walk on and which to get a fast pass for this app is a must i also recommend paying the extra for parking on the main micky and friends garage so you can park next to the escalators and elevators makes a huge difference after walking miles around the parks ,5,2018-06-18
2563,Like a kid again,disneyland is fun no matter your age but it always makes me feel like a kid again there is so much to see and do and eat but you need to have comfortable shoes i always bring a spare pair because after to hours my feet are always killing me ,5,2018-06-18
2564,Awesome time! Our daughter loved it!,the park is amazing as usual we were given passes to attend disney free and it was magical the weather played a big factor as well because it was not hot at all fathers day weekend was also not as packed so we got on every ride we wanted to very quick ,5,2018-06-18
2565,Happiest place on Earth!,our family loves disneyland we choose to come here over any other theme park nearly every time it can get pretty crowded though so do your research and check dates in advance it helps ,5,2018-06-18
2566,Corporate Disney,i love disney and it has a sentiment piece in my heart i m sad that it had become more and more about getting money out of us and the rides don t change much only adding pixar into everything a few more adult rides wouldn t hurt either ,3,2018-06-18
2567,phenomenal day . Use fast pass,weather was amazing i am like a disney junkie so i go to all the parks all over the world some rides are the same and some rides are better queues were excessively long but fast pass always helps and that really works watched the fireworks at pm which was great and then there was another show at pm by the lake and that was also fantastic would eat lunch at the new orleans area which has more of a feel than the normal fast food ,5,2018-06-18
2568,Wonderful,i ve been to disney world more times than i can count but this was my first trip to disneyland it s everything you love about wdw but on a smaller and more manageable scale this park really embraces its history making it far more charming than its east coast sibling ,4,2018-06-17
2569,Loved Disneyland since I was a kid..but,it is a crime what they charge for entrance and food they should be ashamed of themselves obviously park ticket prices are ridiculous but food and drink prices were outrageous also very few edible vegetarian options overall hugely disappointing hard to enjoy the creativity and fun of this park when you can t stop thinking about how a day stay cost more than most people s monthly mortgage or rent payment ,3,2018-06-17
2570,It’s Disney,not sure i can add more from a review perspective then to say it s disney this was my first time here as a year old daddy i was amazed superior customer service and facilities it was the best kept theme park i have seen very clean and engaged cast members rides are amazing loved pirates of the caribbean i was not prepared for the crowds that part is overwhelming they re huge do yourself a favor and get the fast pass option pictures are included and it was super helpful my best advice is to find a disney pro and talk to them for tips and tricks when you are at the park have fun ,5,2018-06-17
2571,Disneyland fun for everyone !,my family of four along with my mother and sister recently took a memorable trip to disneyland there were fun attractions and lots of live entertainment to keep us busy for five days there were fun attractions and lots of live entertainment that are suitable for all ages there was so much to do it keep us busy for five days toontown and the rides in fantasyland were a family favorite my children were able to experience the jedi training we had a wonderful breakfast in the park with minnie and friends mickey and the magical map made wonderful afternoon shaded entertainment disneyland park is just the right size for a family to enjoy the other part guests were very courteous and polite we had so much fun we cannot wait to return ,5,2018-06-17
2572,Always a Fun Vacation,it s the happiest place on earth last time we stayed in resort located directly off of downtown disney this was a lifesaver for our feet whenever anyone got too tired we went back took a shot break and got back out there we love the indiana jones ride as well as pirates of the caribbean such a great atmosphere be sure to try the dole pineapple frozen treat in magic kingdom ,5,2018-06-17
2573,Best Trip Ever,disney never disappoints with the entertainment value for young and old max pass is great and you can order from some restaurants on the disney app the pixar parade was fantastic and so is the new fireworks show if you want a seat in front better be there by pm to save a spot ,5,2018-06-16
2574,Relive your childhood,the selfie or photo with the background of the disneyland board can be missed easily unless you make an effort to find it stop and take pictures we passed by it and kept looking for it while walking ahead stood in the line at the entrance and realised that we d already missed it the best way to make optimal use of a one day ticket would be to choose the rides and shows in each land carefully go to these in an order use the fastrack passes are free with each ticket and make use of the single rider option try and finish your snack or lunch while on the way from one area to another keep some time at the end before the fireworks begin for browsing and shopping my teenagers enjoyed disneyland thoroughly we adults were transported back to childhood with all the disney characters around and of course all the exciting rides it s a great way to spend time together ,5,2018-06-16
2575,Magical and Special,as a big fan of walt disney world i was not sure what to expect while going to a different park it was better than i expected there is lots of similarities to magic kingdom but also many differences the rides are so much fun and are unique only a few similar to the one in florida and there is different characters walking around and riding rides such as the evil queen alice and mad hatter and mary poppins toontown was exceptional will be back ,5,2018-06-15
2576,Disney fan from a small child...,wow now mid s and really looked forward to spending a couple of days at disneyland california where a childhood dream could be fulfilled i thought there d be a big disneyland sign welcoming everyone as you drove in that set the scene for an exciting day nope but all good as we saw a few buses with the disney logo on them so we knew we were in the right place far out the crowds are out of control and the rides are average at best worth the money i guess you gotta say you ve been there but we were underwhelmed if you re coming from australia be prepared for an expensive food experience about aus for a couple of burgers chips and a drink the crowds are ridiculous but if you like it crowded then you ll love it ,3,2018-06-15
2577,Open to Close - Loved every minute,like this park so much more than florida it is smaller less crowded and no humidity our longest line was only minutes in early june use the fast pass for most popular rides take the monorail to tomorrowland to avoid main street entrance not as crowded our favorite rides were matterhorn and mr toad jungle cruise at night was a new experience we booked a table service meal for dinner so we could get a rest ,5,2018-06-15
2578,Happiest place on earth!,my family and i recently went to the disneyland parks with our year old we knew it was going to be a very different experience than the previous times we have gone the security check point is now in the front before you enter downtown disney i thought that was a nice change made me feel safer knowing that all areas surrounding the parks were being monitored while we were at the security check point the cast member who was checking out bags noticed we were traveling with a small child he then informed us if we ran out of diapers wipes or other baby items that there were places located in the parks to get more i was pleasantly surprised that would definitely save us a trip from going back to our hotel i told him thank you for that information and asked how can we locate these areas he said wherever there is a pacifier on the park map that is a station where we could refill our items luckily we did not need to go to these stations so i m not certain if they are complimentary i did see little signs advertising these stations by the changing tables in the restrooms i felt our first trip to disneyland with our little boy was great lots for him to do and can t wait to take him back ,5,2018-06-15
2579,The scale and concept of Disneyland never fails to amaze,it is the happiest place on earth on entering disneyland one forgets all the pains and ills of life and gets transported to a wonderland truly the most magnificent places on earth wish i could live here all my life ,5,2018-06-15
2580,So much fun!,i m generally not one for rides and scream any time i am on one as i am a big scaredy cat however i did end up going on a few of the tamer ones and thoroughly enjoyed myself and wished i had started earlier i would suggest at least two or three days as a day is not enough to even get through half of the park something for everyone and was great fun ,5,2018-06-15
2581,Get the MaxPass!,is it expensive yes is it crowded yes but go and have a good time no one does it like disney and this is a place where all ages can have fun lose yourself in the magic of it all one thing we learned on this last trip was about the maxpass it does cost money but what it saved us was time and energy running around the park the maxpass can be purchased when you download the disneyland app on your phone it can be used for both disneyland and dca it is per person it gives you the ability to get your fast pass on your phone instead of running to each ride and getting the paper passes you also get an unlimited disney photo pass for all the pictures taken on rides or with a disney photographer we had people in our group and i linked all our tickets to the app it truly helped us have a more enjoyable time since we could focus on the fun instead of running to the other side of the park to grab a paper fast pass and the running back when it was time to go on the ride ,5,2018-06-15
2582,Amazing park with a lot of great rides!,great park for all ages queues aren t too bad compared to disney world rides are fun and food is good matterhorn is the highlight for any trip the new fastpass system using the disney land app is good but you are only allowed one fp at a time should be allowed more to maximise you day at the park ,5,2018-06-14
2583,The Traditional Park,an amazing day our family had visiting the original rides it s a small world etc plenty of eateries although no alcohol available in this part which some parents would enjoy by the end of the day some rides appear in need of an upgrade we got stuck up in splash mountain but customer service were great to those on the ride indiana jones ride is tired and rickety ,4,2018-06-13
2584,So. Much. FUN!,we ve just enjoyed our rd disneyland holiday loved it we had days to spend at both disneyland and california adventure parks we spent at disney and i at california adventure we use the fastpass for the rides that tend to have the longest wait times works really well we didn t use the new disney mobile app didn t feel it was necessary for us we stayed at the anaheim hotel i ve reviewed it on t a wear your most comfortable shoes our son was years old on our first disney visit and just missed out on a few of the rides as he wasn t tall enough he s now and enjoyed it all especially autopia as he is now tall enough to drive his own car without a passenger disneyland is our favourite family holiday ,5,2018-06-13
2585,Selfie Stick and Tickets Refund,we got caught off guard how bureaucratic disney can be when we booked the tickets off the app nothing was said explicitly about selfie stick not allowed into the park we explained we did not deliberately bring the selfie stick but forgot to remove it from the bag since we came in a rush we perfectly understood why selfie stick is not allowed in the park even better there was not facility to store the selfie stick and the only options which were not options to us were to leave it in the car which we took lyft there or throw it away drastic yes we so excited to see mickey and we did not read carefully the lines of terms and conditions before heading to the park but why not spare some thought for customers to allocate lockers to store the long list of prohibit items which could be accessed after exiting the park why no such option we saw people smoking and puffing in the park too why they were allowed entry to the park with cigarettes and e cigarettes in their bag this was a bad start of the day resulted from bad thought process of handling exceptions we wanted a refund and got directed by security to the ticket booth waited for mins and the booth staff apologized they could not help since the ticket was booked from the app ,2,2018-06-13
2586,Big kid in a little kids world, years i have waited for the opportunity to go to disneyland and it didn t disappoint was everything i expected and more obviously very crowded but the staff ensure the day is very smooth and comfortable a must for any child and big kids too awesome,5,2018-06-13
2587,Total Disney failure,i really wanted to love disneyland but our family s experience was well below average and not what i expected from disney we went to disney world several years ago and had the magical disney experience so i was really looking forward to this visit unfortunately most of the cast members we had interactions with were rude or unhelpful we had a terrible experience with chris at space mountain we showed up at a m during our scheduled fastpass time only to be told that the system was down and to come back any time we went on our way and enjoyed a few other rides while also continuing to use our fastpass to schedule other rides we came back just before noon but my unused fastpass reservation for space mountain disappeared from the app by no fault of my own i explained to chris what had happened and asked if we could get on since we were told to come back any time he was rude said there is nothing he can do and told me to make another reservation i explained again that i already had a reservation but it got deleted from the app he continued to argue with me and even claimed that i had already ridden the ride and was just trying to cut in line i finally gave up and angrily stormed off we went and had a ridiculously overpriced lunch and then i went back to try again thankfully chris was gone so i went up to another cast member and again explained my situation she started to give me the same there s nothing i can do speech i heard from chris but seeing that i wasn t going to give up she got another person to help me he took my phone and looked it up in their system and again told me i had used the passes i told him we have never ridden this ride in our lives it was actually closed for maintenance when we went to disney world he begrudgingly took my phone again and added passes back on our account while we finally got to ride it i should never have had to argue so much with a disney employee they are there to make sure everyone is happy and has a great time but apparently the cast members i dealt with didn t get that memo and this was not the only situation the cast members are not supposed to say i don t know or i can t help you but i heard that from several that i talked to when i had questions or needed help needless to say this is our one and only trip to disneyland as i will never go back we also went to universal studios and the san diego zoo while we were in california and couldn t have had a better experience with their employees at less than half the price of disneyland i might add what was supposed to be the highlight of our trip turned out to be the worst experience we had our entire trip to l a and san diego sorry disney but you just lost a former lifelong fan ,1,2018-06-13
2588,It’s okay,i prefer disneyworld over disneyland it s not a lot to do with kids and the fast passes or ridiculous,3,2018-06-13
2589,Awesome!,obviously disney park is awesome but what amazed me the most is how organized everything was given the number of people there lots of kids everything was organized well we felt very safe and comfortable there and my daughter had lots of fun with the princesses ,5,2018-06-13
2590,US vacation,great rides tomorrow land is my absolute favourite the evening parade was good and the grand finale the fireworks were just amazing ,5,2018-06-13
2591,Poor Customer Treatment,in the past i have always loved going to disneyland and enjoying their theme parks my family and i have loved going to the california adventure and the classic disneyland parks since they were young the last time that i had visited the park was back in my kids might have gone since then but i did not because i got busy with life we went again as a family in may of it was memorial day weekend but i was willing to work through the crowds and the heat because my kids had really difficult schedules and that was the only week we could go as a family the park was crowded especially the mega popular rides like splash mountain i got the fast pass for splash mountain and we had to return back there at around pm it was around am so we decided to try to find some lunch we tried downtown disney but all those places were crowded so we drove out of the park and went to a nearby restaurant we struggled to get back in time but we were around mins late for the fast pass time zone so we struggled to walk all the from the parking lot to the ride then jennifer would not let us into the ride in the fast pass lane because we were late i tried to talk to her telling her that we were running late from lunch and struggled to get to the ride through the crowds but she did not care she wasn t going to let us in i got mad so i told her that i wanted to talk to her supervisor i stood in front of her until her supervisor came then mat only one t in mat from encino hills came to us he was the supervisor we talked he said that it is a policy that patrons who are late within mins are allowed in the fast pass i asked where is that policy written he said that it is unwritten policy then i asked if it isn t written then why cant our min tardiness be considered okay since it is not a written policy but an spoken policy he was stubborn as well and did not let us in either he told me that i can go to city hall and complain i got more mad he wants me to spend more of my precious time to struggle to get to their customer service office and talk to yet another person there all in the hot afternoon in a crowded disneyland park let me tell you something mat and jennifer you made disneyland a very unhappiness place in the world for us you guys need to remember who is paying for all of disney funds all the money coming to the theme parks is from people like us we were not trying to cheat the system we did not fabricate tickets to get in we tried to work with the system we were a small group a family of five disney needs to re learn from walt disney that the visitors and patrons should be treated well and with some flexibility when the park is very crowded and hot disney please learn ,1,2018-06-13
2592,Love love love,i simply love disneyland it really is the happiest place on earth the park is impeccably clean and the service is amazing the food is all pretty good and i think the value is fairly good i would highly recommend getting the disney max pass for per day you get access to book fast passes fp on your phone via the disneyland app the app tells you what time the next available time slot is and you can select that time you can book your next fp when your current one has commenced or mins later if you are having to book a fp for later in the day you can have a max of booked at any one time the best rides are space mountain indiana jones splash mountain pirates the pixar parade at pm is great and obviously you can t miss the fireworks at pm ,5,2018-06-13
2593,So Much To Do,i went with a mixed group of ages everyone had a great time we did a day hopper my only suggestion would be that you try and avoid consecutive days take a day off and do something else ,5,2018-06-12
2594,Way too crowded to really be enjoyable(more than once),i get it its disney and the name itself conjures up happy feelings but they have to figure out a way to manage the crowds disneyland is just insanity with the all the visitors and now that every other person has to be on a scooter it makes for an impossible impasse on most avenues we did use fast pass and the morning was great and fairly enjoyable but by early afternoon fast passes were no longer available on some of the rides we actually waited hours and minutes to get on splash mountain that is ridiculous i even felt that a lot of the employees were not as nice as usual it was degrees and when i bought a lukewarm drink and asked to exchange it for a cold one i was met with an exasperated sigh i realize dealing with the throngs ain t fun each day but disney is expensive so try to tolerate the customer this just isn t my first choice for a fun vacation its obligatory for the kids but it really is a once and done event for us if i have my way i would take a disney cruise any day over disneyland ,3,2018-06-12
2595,Trip of a lifetime,if you do this the right way you will have to go early am and get the fast pass do the lesser stuff in between make a list and just have fun i was a little disappointed that i never saw mickey but i did skip both parades and watched the fireworks from our campsite we also did or do the hopper maybe another time,5,2018-06-11
2596,"""Family Fun""",very fun we enjoyed it you really need more than one day to see everything get fast passes for the rides it saves so much time in waiting to get on the rides we loved the splash mountain ride with the grand children and they loved it too if your little ones want to see the parade make sure you find a seat early up front that way the children can see and it s great fun when the characters shake their hand ,5,2018-06-11
2597,Special needs not accommodated :(,we were so looking forward to this visit after growing up as longtime pass holders our daughter s special needs were not accommodated or acknowledged by staff ignored by characters we won t be back universal studios really saved our vacation ,2,2018-06-11
2598,Use the Disney App,mecca for children worldwide using the disney app for the getting fastpass digital tickets is worth the extra cost especially if you are only visiting the park on one day at same time the app is not without issues it gave wrong info on a basic matter listing a disney lot for parking that was actually closed on the day of our visit ,5,2018-06-11
2599,The Mother Ship,the mother of all theme parks disneyland is still and always will be the best where else can you ride a great roller coaster and watch a stirring abraham lincoln history lesson delivered by the man himself pricey and always crowded but still worth the trip take advantage of fast passes for popular rides be patient and take time to people watch best of all stop and enjoy the musical offerings barbershop quartet banjo picker fabulous ragtime pianist et al this is how to best enjoy this wonderful original park ,5,2018-06-11
2600,Disneyland,the best rides are space mountain thunder mountain and splash mountain i always sit next to window in the spaghetti factory since the s s and s the last time i was invited to disneyland was in with free tickets and free food i m still waiting for disneyland italy have a wonderful day it s a small world after all disney way has grown with alot of new estate to adventure a must see anthony,5,2018-06-11
2601,Tips for a 2yo at Disney,first off it s disneyland therefore it s amazing and gets stars if you are worried your kid won t remember it who cares disney is magical in the moment you ll get great pictures and let s be honest it s fun for mom and dad so we recently took our month old daughter who loves mickey to disney and here are my tips app download the disneyland app it has the map the events ride wait times where s the nearest bathroom where are the characters mobile food ordering and your tickets plus a hundred other things tickets get the day ticket with max pass and photopass you ll want days at disneyland and day at disney adventure california you can do more days and do rides multiple times you could also do it in days and skip some things either way spend at least of your time on the disneyland side my review for dac will be under that link on this site with photopass you ll get great photos from the photographers they scan a barcode in the app and all the pictures show up shortly after don t worry about handing your phone to a stranger for that family pic get a pro to do it if you don t want this the photographer will take pics with your camera or phone plans plan out what you want to see and do we did the downtown and tomorrowland side one day the critter country and adventure land side the other day we hit toontown and fantasyland both days as these have the most kiddie rides characters events we also watched the parades both days and stayed late for the fireworks night events pick one major thing to do and make reservations ahead of time at least a month we choose the fantasmic dinner with water and light show lots of fireworks and mickey great music our kid was dancing and fascinated the whole time our friends chose a character dining breakfast breakfast with minnie has the most characters they got to meet lots of characters and get pictures both are expensive but tons of fun pictures note the times of characters in the park using the app they come and go some characters make short appearances and the lines for pictures get long quickly we basically stalked them as they came out of the cast room and ran to get in line first also your kid will be scared at first so it may take several tries to get that perfect picture go to a pin shop and ask for the my st trip pin it s free use a sharpie to write their name and the date you can also buy collectors pins but we decided to wait until she s older they have other free pins too for birthdays and celebrations rides there s tons of rides your kid can ride more than any other theme park i recommend the classics like the teacups dumbo and the carousel there s also pinocchio winnie the pooh roger rabbit and many other slow rides with lots of characters singing as for you parents riding the adult rides this is where fastpass maxpass comes in use the app to reserve a time for you to ride a ride you and your spouse pick different rides at different times when you go ask the cast member for the baby swap and then your spouse can go right after you example mom picks indiana jones from am to am and dad picks splash mountain from am to pm mom goes to ij at am gets the baby swap pass for dad then rides the ride she comes out and takes baby so dad can ride ij then head over to splash mountain at dad gets baby swap rides the ride gets baby and then mom rides fyi you will get soaked on splash mountain including your shoes awesome on hot days but be ready bring flip flops maybe some dry underwear or be ready to sit in the sun and dry out the exciting rides take those pics during the exciting part so at the end you put the code in your photo app and bam you got the pic some rides get long lines like hours long nobody wants to pay a ticket to stand in line all dang day pony up the extra and skip the lines gear we brought diaper bags an umbrella stroller with detachable cup holders and a mini thermal lunch bag that sounds like a lot but it wasn t hubby carried a medium sized backpack style diaper bag with his sunscreen a few diapers wipes dry snacks you wants lots of snacks and feed them to your kid when waiting in line change of baby clothes and a dry shirt and flip flops for him and a backup battery for his phone everything is in ziploc bags to keep it dry and cheerio free his was only half full i carried a small messenger bag with the same a pencil pouch with crayons and mini color pages and used it as my purse as well with my wallet and a pouch of emergency gear bandaids chapstick hairties and girl gear i have a gb pockit stroller that collapses small and has a shade and small basket underneath plus a stroller cup holder thing i got at walmart with refillable water bottles we use the brita sport bottles because water fountain water tastes funny in the basket was baby sunscreen a thermal lunch bag with milk fruit uncrustable yogurt cheese for the kids lunch a cheap thin beach towel rolled up and a sheer car seat cover that doubled as a blanket or just sunshade bring hats and sunglasses for everyone for the tram and train you must collapse your stroller so we had all those things in the diaper bags until we got to the park parking many hotels offer free shuttles we used a parking garage for and used the tram there s also drop off pickup spots where you could use uber or a taxi meals there s tons of small stands with quick food like hotdogs and popcorn there s also lots of restaurants with burgers and wraps salads and some decent kid meals for a nice dinner we went to blue bayou several places have mobile ordering using the app great way to skip the lines and trust me you ve stood in enough lines everything is a bit pricier than normal so this is why i pack small snacks for mom and dad too we try to only buy lunch and maybe some ice cream in the park i recommend a big breakfast at the hotel then grab some fruit and yogurt to go safety write your name and phone number on your kids arm with a sharpie or pen if they get lost they ll take your kid to the town hall and they can call you you can park your stroller at one of many stroller parking places but take your bags with you nobody ever messed with our stroller just remember where you left it because there s hundreds of them some people put their name on their stroller with tape not a bad idea if you have a popular model you can also rent a stroller but they are hard plastic sunscreen costs a million dollars in the park so bring plenty put your kid and your husband in a bright color so you can see them in the crowd naps we let our kid nap in her stroller and this was our prime parents ride the rides time i ve heard of people going back to the hotel to nap rest and then coming back to the park to me that is too much effort but maybe if you stayed at one of the hotels on the property souvenirs first off they re more expensive in the park we only bought a few things that couldn t be bought elsewhere there s lots of diy mouse ears on pinterest lots of the toys you can buy on amazon and cheaper you can buy glow sticks for cents at walmart or mouse glow sticks at dl your toddler doesn t know the difference we got a frame for one of those great pics and a little toy set that our kid played with everywhere hotel pool car so basically good planning led to an awesome trip great pictures and very few toddler tantrums next time i think we ll spend days instead of cause it s just that awesome ,5,2018-06-10
2602,Walt’s Park,you come here to share experiences and leave the everyday boredom of life great food great entertainment great experiences ,5,2018-06-10
2603,Great entertainment!,we visited disneyland california as a family vacation it was the first time for some of us i arranged a breakfast in the park with minnie and friends and our granddaughter loved all the characters use of fast pass helped with wait time rides were fun for all of us we all loved disney district where it was like a long city street full of shops restaurants and even a theater a great vacation for all ,5,2018-06-10
2604,Not so happy this time of visit,i ve always said that disneyland is the happiest place there is because every time we visit the workers are so nice and cheerful well today wasn t the case the cast members of course not all but most that we encountered today in between rides we took from the places we ate the customer service wasn t what it used to be they don t smile they don t greet you they don t assist even when u ask for help fast pass entrance on indiana they ignore you it s like they don t even like their job i m hoping that was just today ,3,2018-06-10
2605,"Its Disneyland, that's all you need to know.",of course everyone loves disneyland they have all that you would expect from the characters to the rides to shopping and food the lines and waiting can be a little ridiculous but if you get there early or get a fast pass you can cut down on that a bit i would go again but hopefully not during peak season to avoid a little bit of the crowds but it can be very enjoyable either way ,4,2018-06-10
2606,Amazing.,loved loved loved our trip to disney came with our yo and hired a pram and did almost hours in the park across days rides are amazing and although it was busy it was worth every minute ,5,2018-06-09
2607,"Expensive, But Worth It",wow the magic kingdom really puts a dent in the wallet but in the end the memories for the kids are worth it and we make the budget work by staying in a hotel that s close enough to be convenient but far enough away to escape the crazy high hotel prices in the immediate disneyland area that s the key to making it work especially if you have kids ,5,2018-06-09
2608,Disneyland adventures,had a great time her there is plenty to do and see in the park all the staff are great plenty of food and drink choices as well,5,2018-06-09
2609,Very similar to Disney World,from parking to ride lines nobody does logical crowd control like the disney organization the basic layout is the same as at disney world after going through security screening bag check you walk under the main street train depot onto a little circle at the other side of the circle you will find the foot of main street which is modeled after an old downtown with shops on both sides of the street the train can take you all the way around disneyland with stops in all the lands continuing on main street leads into the hub of a wheel with different lands on each spoke at the other end of the hub is cinderella s castle clockwise from the main street spoke you will find adventureland frontierland liberty square fantasyland and toontown and tomorrowland each area has its own theme restaurants and bathrooms there are some pretty hard core roller coasters as well as tamer rides for the younger children if there are large crowds on the day of your visit suggest eating before or after the peak mealtimes as tables can be hard to find there are scheduled shows and live plays based on disney movies and in costume characters at designated places for photo autograph opportunities there are full princess packages to have your little girl changed into her favorite princess with hair makeup and costume depending on how much the parents want to spend on their little girl s special day we took advantage of the canoe trip which is not available at disney world we also rode the matterhorn roller coaster which disney world does not have for an extra day ticket you can schedule fast passes on your smart phone to bypass the long lines at the most popular rides and stand in a much shorter line without access to the premium scheduler app you have to get your fast passes at kiosks located around the park at nearly day ticket there is plenty to do at disneyland to keep an energetic family busy from opening am to closing midnight there are fireworks and a laser light show late in the evening ,5,2018-06-08
2610,Wonderful to see,did not think we would have time to visit disneyland but we fitted it in we are two older ladies and we had a great time some of the rides you had to line up for for over an hour and it isn t even their summer holidays yet we enjoyed our day as it is worth seeing at least once ,4,2018-06-08
2611,Love this Magic Kingdom,everything is exceptional it s always a memorable visit my husband and i enjoyed this visit as if we were kids,5,2018-06-08
2612,Uh,i don t get why this place is such a great attraction the rides are ok but you only can do a few because of the long waits the food stinks the stores are outrageous it s an exhausting day at best the best thing was the parade and great fireworks do yourself a favor skip it if you can ,2,2018-06-07
2613,Prepare to be disappointed- nothing like other Disney Parks.,wait times were hours on a moderately crowded monday and fast passes were hours out multiple rides broke down while we were in line we rode just rides in hours and finally left out of frustration i cant imagine what the day would have been like if we had kids or a stroller with us not a safe experience with so many people clearly the park cant accommodate the crowds and needs to reassess the experience of their guests cast members were rude and angry without exception if you have been to any orlando parks or universal you will be shocked at the state of disneyland the lack of signage was almost comical i am a massive disney fan and love the other parks save your money and time ,1,2018-06-07
2614,Great twilight visit,this was my first visit to disneyland and it was everything i hoped and dreamed the lines were as to be expected but the disneyland app was helpful in being able to strategically choose the next ride due to its display of accurate wait times absolutely loved the indiana jones adventure ride and the fantasmic show ,5,2018-06-07
2615,Fun but crowded,i love visiting here with my girlfriend but it was ridiculously packed this time about hours wait times for each ride for the price of the ticket it was not that worth it,2,2018-06-06
2616,I met a lot of characters!!,while disneyland is not the most modern of parks it is still magical there is something interesting to see lurking in every corner i m not really a ride person which was a relief when i saw the posted waiting times minutes yikes but i did get to meet several characters and have pix taken without too much waiting around mickey s house was awesome and i love the shopping so many cool finds the staff throughout the park were very friendly and kudos to them for maintaining this busy park so beautifully not a speck of garbage to be found ,4,2018-06-06
2617,Went for 1 day,we went on memorial day weekend for day we chose the original disneyland park once we figured out the fast pass system it all went awesome we didn t wait for than minutes for any of the rides my son is and had a blast,5,2018-06-06
2618,"Yes, you should get a MaxPass",i can t imagine there needs to be another disneyland review right it s awesome but i will say that we went one day without a maxpass and one day with a maxpass and it made all the difference in the world we live in southern california so we have been to disneyland ca adventure a lot we re no longer passholders but we do get to go fairly often this was the first time going with a maxpass and it was our best visit you walk around picking out which fastpass you want not by walking across the park and picking up a fastpass but by just using the disney app wherever you are in the park so you pick your fastpass it tells you when it is valid typically either mins from now or an hour from now depending upon the popularity of the ride and then you let your fastpasses dictate your day we would pick a fastpass and then as we made our way through the park heading toward that ride we would ride on one or two other rides then after we used our fastpass we would immediately sign up for the next one and do the same thing magical i know the tickets are already expensive so more seems crazy but trust me it is worth it unless you go on a totally empty day which is rare these days go for it i would say we didn t really need the maxpass at california adventure ca is laid out differently than disneyland and its much easier to get across the park and grab a fastpass than it is at disneyland so unless it is a very very crowded day at ca you can skip the maxpass but at disneyland do it ,5,2018-06-06
2619,The Happiest Place on Earth indeed,one day is not enough to enjoy this place especially because the park is so busy and the queues for the rides are so long that definitely one day is not enough to enjoy the place but we had a blast with our year old ,5,2018-06-06
2620,"Same, same, every time",other than a few rides shut down and few other open the rides are pretty much the same every time it has almost become stale we as a family may not revisit this park until they actually add more exciting rides also if you are a vegetarian you wold have surprisingly limited food options here ,3,2018-06-06
2621,Magical in every way!,a perfect way to jump right into the disney magic this park is ageing but not at all in a bad way it is kept in pristine condition by a team of super friendly helpful and knowledgeable cast that will go above and beyond to help you in any way they can allow a few days to experience the whole park ,5,2018-06-06
2622,Wasnt the happiest place on earth LOL,i was expecting it will be the happiest place on earth lol went to the park at am and there you go the line up to the entrance was crazy you have to line up for the security thing they will check your stuffs manually they dont have a scanner or xray machine it took forever and wasnt sure if they will detect something by just checking those stuffs manually then you will pass another security they took my go pro stick and i was so sad i literally cried goodthing i have sunglasses on me they said its their new policy whatever then when we were on our way to the park it was already crowded and i havent seen a crowd like that ever lol it is very a huge park it was so hot as well their prices inside the park for food and everything are so ridiculous you have to line up for everything for washroom rides foods everything well i just wanna try how it feels to be in there took a lot of pictures they have some photographers in some area and they will take picture of you behind those castles and spots then if you have a maxpass you can download the pictures online so better get a maxpass we tried some rides my boyfriend loves them then ended up getting sick after some few rides so we have to go back to our hotel earlier we were planning to wait for the fireworks it was fine with me then since it wasnt really my thing i really hate the crowd and hate walking that much under the heat of the sun ,1,2018-06-06
2623,Very long lines,we last visited here in we only had day so didn t get too many rides done because it was so busy we did have a good time but more time is definately required ,5,2018-06-05
2624,Disney done right,we followed an itinerary that allowed us to easily conquer every major ride before noon and had an amazing time i would not recommend dining in the new orleans area because the food is very overrated and very overpriced have the iconic turkey leg and dole whip instead ,5,2018-06-05
2625,The most magical place on Earth,booked tickets in advance online tickets were very expensive to start with so only bought access to the main disneyland park as i had never visited california before parking was easy and we got the shuttle bus from the car park to the entrance and underwent security checks we had home printed tickets and they were taken off us at the gate and we had our photo taken and were given new cards which we were able to link to the disneyland app so we could reserve fast passes the park was busy but i wouldn t say we struggled to get on rides we could fastpass one at a time so just made our way back to the entrance at that time the longest we waited was half an hour for big thunder mountain food prices in the park were elevated but not as expensive as i thought it would be and paid for chicken and chips with a cup of water we spent all day at the park and reserved dining in the downtown disney for just in time for the start of the fireworks the show was magical and afterwards everybody was efficient in leave the park quickly the park had a lot of buses on to take the crowds of people back to the car park i loved my disney california experience and would love to return ,5,2018-06-05
2626,Be aware of selfie stick..read below for info,make sure that you hide your selfie stick otherwise will be taken away at the security point do not leave on plain sight in your bag either you will have to surrender it or walk back to your car and loose precious time make sure you arrive very early even before the park opens lines are huge already and you can spend up to minutes on some rides make sure to line up on the most busy rides first like roller costers park is pretty pack until late night people will wait for fireworks and the show on the lake which is pretty good with mickey water show pirate boat etc this show is pretty busy and staff won t let you stand anywhere you want they are specific zones depending on your ticket so again go and stand at least minutes before show start at pm otherwise you won t see it ,4,2018-06-05
2627,Not the Happiest Place on Earth,disneyland is amazing however inviting seniors is not they were obnoxious and behaved like they were entitled one of our rides was shut down due to one intelligent senior who started to shed clothing and hopped out of the ride a suggestion might be to have a real senior day and give the privilege to senior citizens who might actually behave and appreciate the kind gesture ,3,2018-06-04
2628,Incredible Fun Celebrating Birthday at Disneyland!,my wife and i came to disneyland while on our stay at the grand californian hotel spa we both had an incredible time filled with so many magical memories and experiences overall experience we came as early as we could so we could make the most of our day we used the disneyland app to map out our day and definitely recommend during our visit we did our best to ride as many rides as possible i was super impressed with the amount of dining options inside the park had an amazing time celebrating my wife s birthday experienced some amazing shows fireworks and music yummy foods and snacks personally i love those goofy snacks but they re all great conclusion we had an absolutely amazing time at disneyland for my wife s birthday filled with so many magical memories that my wife and i will remember for a lifetime the rides were so much fun and the shows were amazing too the cast members were so incredibly friendly and helpful and made our experiences that much more memorable we will definitely recommend disneyland to all our family and friends ,5,2018-06-04
2629,Getting crowded for summer already,arrived at am on a thursday went with my wife and year old son getting on rides early in the day is best was able to do attractions in tomorrowland in less than hours you must use the fastpass to save time and then go to the non fast pass attractions until it is your designated time for your fastpass ride the longest wait we had was for the dumbo ride a non fastpass attraction a smartphone app that tells you the wait times for attractions is a must another timesaver is using a mobile app to make dining reservations and order food at places you would normally wait in line after lunchtime the crowds were heavier wall to wall people in some locations particularly around the entrance to adventureland and frontierland my son finally reached the height minimums for some rides and enjoyed splash mountain star tours and thunder mountain railroad we stayed in the park until the fireworks ended waited min in a non reserved area to watch the fireworks to get more people out of the park faster we got to go through the cast member area behind main street if it were possible i would visit disneyland in the off season just so the crowds can be a little thinner but i gotta go when my child s got vacation ,4,2018-06-04
2630,Memorial Weekend,well i did what i said i would never do and this visit disneyland on a weekend holiday weekend at that i can can say it is worth getting the maxpass to be able to do the fastpass right on your phone we were able to ride all the attractions we wanted with minimal wait time even for the rides we had to wait the lines went fast it has been a while since i have been here and like that we can bring in a soft cooler and pack snacks and drinks for the drinks cost can be an issue since it s not cheap to get in but being able to bring in food is a cost savings i will definetely be back,5,2018-06-04
2631,A great day out!,disney never fails to impress cast members are friendly and helpful and although some of the main rides were not working it did not spoil the day too much ,5,2018-06-04
2632,Awesome,so much fun with our children definitely recommend the fast pass app as the park is so busy you can waste so much time waiting in queues ,5,2018-06-04
2633,Can't believe the decline,there is so much i could say about the way the budget cuts and poor cast training is spoiling walts little park but as a long time returning visitor i will simply address the cuts in cleaning and leave it at saying these cuts apply to the way the place is run as a whole we first visited in and couldn t get over how amazingly well the place was kept the legendary no litter everything spotless now it appears the rivers of america has plastic bottles and popcorn boxes floating around all over bins overflow and when folks empty drinks or snack bags they just drop them on the floor walt disneys legendary disneyland railway train pulls into the station full of litter both on the floor and on the seats the restrooms that used to be the cleanest i had used now are dirtier than the ones at heathrow airport no mr iger that is not a compliment ,2,2018-06-03
2634,Fun but not as magical an experience as WDW-Orlando.,our first time at this park there were plenty of rides and activities but the lines were to long fastpass didn t seem much shorter on some rides we did not get the maxpass we were not sure is was worth the cost hyperspace mountain was better than space mountain in orlando we got soaked on the splash mountain bring extra clothes if you ride this attraction indiana jones adventure was fun as well but the line was terrible if you have a bad back or get car sick you may want to rethink riding this attraction the ride will bounce you around every which way still a lot of fun unfortunately pirates of the caribbean was closed for renovation the haunted mansion was very similar to the one in wdw orlando but the exterior was very different there were numerous other attractions we rode and most were fun but again the lines were way to long ,4,2018-06-03
2635,Grandkids at disneyland,we took a trip to disneyland with the grandkids and family we had been there years before and enjoyed ourselves this time we we re disappointed in the condition of the park it used to be sparkling clean and maintained we felt like it had lost it s sparkle everything is highly over priced and they nickle and dime you on everything lines are long and the rides are short employee s seem friendly but most of them aren t the same as in the past with crisp looking uniforms did we have a good time yes the kids enjoyed it but it could have been so much better we won t be going back ,3,2018-06-03
2636,Nice park but nothing spectacular,it is an amusement park it has rides it has stuff for kids ages toddler to early teens but not adults as it shouldn t you get what you expect long lines overpriced souvenirs way overpriced food that lacks great taste lots of crowds i strongly suggest doing the max pass for person and you get all the professional photos taken of you and get to reserve spots in line not as big as i thought it would be but plan a whole day or more to see everything ,3,2018-06-03
2637,Tourists Should Visit at least Once in their Life,review by drsim dr hcm sim tourists should visit at least once in their life disney has great service culture wonderful ambience go as early as possible and spend the time there till the fireworks in the evening make sure that you keep you eye on your children at all times too many rumours i usually do not bother to go to theme parks but this is the original and the experience is wonderful regards drsim dr hcm sim ,5,2018-06-02
2638,Too commercialized,we were looking forward to our visit to disneyland we were highly disappointed complete waste of money disneyland is nothing like disney world we knew it wouldn t be the same but we were at least hoping to feel the same magic we did not we did not see any characters the whole time we were there the only thing this park cares about is selling it s merchandise whether it be disney or star wars merchandise it was being pandered everywhere the park is overcrowded ride lines are outrageous even with maxpass you wait over two hours the pixar parade was a joke only minutes long food prices are through the roof never again will we visit a disney resort or property time to move on to universal studios ,2,2018-06-02
2639,"So much fun, so many memories!",where do i begin the cars ride is absolutely amazing they really outdid themselves with that ride guardian of the galaxy my kids loved the park is always so clean and well kept most staff is so friendly and helpful it really is a magical place young teen adult it doesn t matter you will have so much fun ,5,2018-06-02
2640,Not on par with Disney World,lack of signage in the park parking is difficult etc was not as crowded as disneyworld but there were also not as many parks to visit ,3,2018-06-02
2641,Wow wow wow,second visit first as a family what amazing memories day pass and still didn t see everything park is sooo clean staff were fantastic the small things such as wishing our kids happy birthday when seeing their badge to free cupcakes and candles things kids won t forget the lines were long and often impatient kids couldn t handle it make the most of early entry and at least day with fast passes days were long but so worth it loved the freedom of the day pass and being able to come and go as the kids got tired fireworks are a must but get a spot early as they don t let you stop and watch if anywhere near a walk way enjoy every moment even if busy you are lucky to go to the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-06-02
2642,Not Magical,so where do i start after visiting disney world in orlando last june we were so looking forward to seeing the original disneyland so disappointed litter seem to be everywhere when you asked a staff member a question for directions ect it seemed a effort for them to tell you so when you hear about disney being magical from the moment you go through the gates i think disney s california park should take a leaf out of disney world in orlando for customer service plus teaching them how to smile something we noticed all the staff did in orlando so i could go on more and think disney need to take some folks from there orlando park to retrain the ones in california ,1,2018-06-02
2643,M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!!,we travelled with people ranging in ages from to and we all had such a fabulous time i was a little hesitant at first since this was my kids first time but all my fears were put to rest as the day progressed my husband did some research before we went and decided beforehand to invest in the maxpass and they were well worth it within the first hour we were able to ride of the big rides at disneyland including haunted mansion splash mountain and its a small world another great benefit of the maxpass is the fact that you get free downloads of all the pictures taken throughout the park we took pictures with mickey mouse in toontown and we were able to keep those pictures without paying the absorbent prices for prints as a matter of fact some of the employees even suggested just printing the prints at target or costco great customer service any way you can save money at disney is well appreciated the lines for the rides without the fastpass weren t too bad i believe our longest wait was about an hour for the peter pan ride all others rides were roughly about a minute wait we went on a friday and we were able to get onto rides altogether our secret was to ride the rides while the parades were going on my kids weren t big fans of parades so it definitely worked to our advantage food was just so so in my opinion defintely overpriced but hey its disneyland its to be expected the park does have a nice picnic area for those who choose to bring their own food into the park for our first trip as a family this trip was definitely memorable my kids now have great memories of their first trip to disneyland and are already looking forward to a return trip thank you disneyland for still being the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-06-01
2644,Still my happiest place on earth!,no matter how old i get i still love disneyland the prices and crowds just keep going up but this will always be my happy place i would highly recommend buying your tickets through the disneyland app and paying the to add on the max pass it is definitely worth it ,5,2018-06-01
2645,Colossal waste of $800.,oh boy so crowded even on a wednesday lots of rides broken or closed wait times ridiculous even using fast pass save yourself the peril and pick another destination tip if you do go get there in the early morning am however if you do want to arrive early stay at the resort because la traffic will be prohibitive you ll spend more this way catch park is years old and has not expanded much but attendance has tripled our kids and has about fun really disney for these prices everything should be operational and you should not have time to eat your over priced lunch while waiting in line for a ride that may or may no work by the time you get to starting gate uugh,2,2018-06-01
2646,It REALLY is the Happiest Place On Earth,we love coming here and come times minimu a year having an ap we miss it when we aren t here and think of disneyland often when we are away it s truly our home away from home ,5,2018-05-31
2647,Love Disney!!,we vacation at disney about once a year and it is so much fun each and every time wear good comfortable shoes because there is a lot of walking food in the park is decent the rides are amazing try it without kids it s so much fun with kids is good if they are older but it s not great for the little ones they get tired don t understand lines and end up crying the max pass was awesome and the was well worth the money we rode everything we wanted to some more than once ,5,2018-05-30
2648,I went to Disney land alone and had the time of my life,disney land is known to be a family place and i had my doubts going solo but it was amazing it is rightly said no one can ever be sad in the happiest place on earth as i was staying in anaheim hilton i got my tickets from there and started my day super early getting into the park is easy process with a small and quick security check i had my breakfast there and went on all the ride there there are so many rides to cover and so many places to sit and eat or just take and eat that you don t realise how you have managed to get through the whole day make sure you were comfortable shoes and are well hydrated though out some rides have lines longer than other for those rides you can actually keep for last and when the fireworks starts all rides are stopped so when you come back and try queuing sometimes it s faster in my case it was take a battery back up as there are so many picture clicking worthy places it s definitely recommended for families but if you are solo and want to go to disney feel free to go enjoy the single ride services on selected rides and the amazing energy there ,5,2018-05-30
2649,It was great,i recommend you go to disney at least once or twice in your life the park was memorable and for the most part is was great the only thing that was not the best was the matterhorn ride broke down like times while i was there but besides that it was fun ,4,2018-05-30
2650,Childhood memories,what a fantastic way to relive your childhood memories from tv but now your an adult you can actually be there,5,2018-05-30
2651,Still the Happiest Place on Earth,this was the first time i had been to disneyland in almost years i have been to disneyworld times during that period it is still utterly fantastic with the disney app to maximize your fast passes the experience here was perfect and adding a park hopper with california adventure makes it even better and make sure to get the photopass such a great value for so many on park photographers that get the photos to you digitally in mere minutes ,5,2018-05-29
2652,Vacation,visited both parks over days had a great dinner at steakhouse have been to disneyland times since have never had a bad experience only great memories and we live minutes from wdw ,5,2018-05-29
2653,Trip of a lifetime,surprise trip for grand children you have to go through security and then queue for parks not too busy but would imagine would be in school holidays hopper passes with fast pass definitely worth it buy in advance as you will save from gate passes lots of opportunities to see mickey and friends and have photo taken getting around easy by train or monorail worth doing just to see where is each land and what is there kiddies all loved disneyland park so much to do use fast pass once you have done that ride you can get another if loves mickey worth going to his house in toy land and also minnie too adult rides too older grandkids had to be and above for most rides fireworks display brill either at the castle or at its a small world both are amazing food and drink prices are higher than outside park and mickey hats are each so can add up fantastic trip day hopper well worth it,5,2018-05-29
2654,Happiest place on earth!,myself and my fianc recently got engaged at walt disney world so where else would we go to celebrate our engagement we had a great time at disneyland it is much smaller than walt disney world but we enjoyed this wait times for rides were not crazy long the cast members are so friendly i love that characters just walk around the park we had an amazing time at disneyland and we can t wait to go back ,5,2018-05-29
2655,Get there early - its worth it,i mean this is a disneyland review you should be able to guess what it s going to say get there early although we weren t staying in a resort hotel we were able to get into the park before and boy did we need it fastpass is your friend it seemed better here than california and watch the time as your day will just fly if you move quickly in the evening you can just about watch paint the night in california then make it back for fireworks and the fantasmic expect to ache afterwards but it s the price you pay for a full disney day ,5,2018-05-29
2656,Still good,had a lovely day here although it is now looking a little tired still very busy so its popularity has obviously not reduced much the rides are very good and at least they upgrade these over the years so they still maintain our interest overall still a nice place to visit for a day despite it looking a little dated ,4,2018-05-29
2657,Best Disneyland park in the world,the first and still the best i ve been going there since i was a kid the app with group fastpass is really cool ,5,2018-05-29
2658,Classic but Still Looking Toward the Future,it has been a few years since i ve been to disneyland i tend to go east for my disney fix but every few years i get drawn back to the more intimate original park and it never disappoints true it tends to be crowded no matter when you go especially on weekends but the new maxpass system helps level the playing field and disney has a way of adding additional detail or new attractions to make it worth coming back to again and again it was nice to see the star wars presence increased and all of the kids who are fans getting excited about the star tours attraction and merchandise and as always it is utterly magical in the evening definitely worth a visit if you haven t been recently ,4,2018-05-29
2659,It’s Disneyland!! Get the Maxpass,my only recommendation is to buy the maxpass in the mobile app it made for easy planning and skipping to the front of the line a huge time saver it comes with photopass so be sure to take advantage of any and all disney on site photo staff in three days my family got pics or more several with fun animations added plus the pics from rides well worth it ,5,2018-05-28
2660,A CHILDHOOD DREAM SHATTERED,after travelling from australia to visit my dream theme park i was sadly disappointed the crowds are excessive the wait times on rides excessive some up to hours the shows difficult to see due to the masses the express pass booths are situated in ridiculous spots that correspond to the ride you think they would be right outside the ride but most aren t and you waste so much time running around trying to find them not being able to check in to a new fastpass ride for another hour makes it difficult for you to plan your day if your an adrenalin junkie and looking for thrills this is not the place to come the rides are mostly directed at kids below the age of about slow boring and mostly same ride over and over again just a different carriage in a different land best ride in disneyland buzz light year astro best ride in disney california guardian of galaxy and the speedway race car top tip if you don t want to wait hours plus for the speedwy race car in disney california than i suggest you get up early go to the park on open and check in your fast passes for your group immediately otherwise fastpass for this ride is sold out by am ridiculous if not go single rider at least you get to ride it then ,2,2018-05-28
2661,Awesome trip,disneyland was everything we could ve imagined i took my son for his th birthday and he had the time of his life we had the day passes but i think we could ve went for more day i don t have any complaints about our trip ,5,2018-05-28
2662,Short lines,look i know disneyland get super busy and pack and that can get irritating look go when its raining thme park us still open get a poncho and go on some rides or check out the stores this is only you re a pass holder if you re not go the park wednesday or thursday good luck,4,2018-05-28
2663,"Amazing and magical place, especially if you are child!",we went to disneyland so that our yr old daughter could experience the magic this place would have on her and it did she loved the characters that we had to buy a mickey pen and autograph book because the other kids had one so she could line up and get photo s and signatures unfortunately everyone is wanting the same thing and it will take up a lot of your time lining up and waiting actually you must go there with an open mind as everyone is there for the same thing enjoyment and going on every ride possible and lining and lining up and waiting and waiting get the drift all good though whilst you wait you have time to talk to your lovely family and reminisce on the day so far and trip so far etc food choices other than the main restaurants are fast food outlets and more on the unhealthy high calorie scale blue bayou restaurant is expensive but food was just average in our opinion you must book days in advance or get lucky on the morning to book for the night the rainforest cafe was ok as well and kids love the jungle theme again food is pricier than what you d expect all the rides are great and we all almost got through all of them splash mountain and indiana jones were my daughters favourite rides after the first hesitation went on these a few times the looney tunes roller coaster ride is a small roller coaster for kids but it does pack a punch and the excitement of it was so great for my daughter we rode this about times in a row hardly any wait times on this one the only disappointing thing we experienced was when we ran out of our own healthy food we bought a banana for our daughter and that cost us us outrageous you can almost get a meal of chips and burger for a little more other than that all the staff are friendly smiling and happy to assist the disney parade is great and a chance to see all the characters on the floats etc our daughter s highlight amongst others was the bippity boppity boutique so for a pretty nice sum us she got the royal treatment with her very own fairy god mother she chose her dress her hair style nail polish got her make up done and then gets a takeaway beauty bag and lastly was the photo shoot yep with cinderella snow white then ariel then a professional photo shoot in the pumpkin carriage wow this was really great to see and how excited our daughter was as they say it is worth more than money can buy but when you are paying aus let s just say it s a once only offer something my parents would definitely not have done when i was a child i suggest that if you want to save some money bring your own snacks drinks and food and go and buy your dinner and enjoy rest and end the day relaxing with a nice meal everyone becomes a kid so overall i we enjoyed ourselves very much and would love to recommend this as a one place your child would love to experience whilst they are still kids and still think that those characters are real ,5,2018-05-28
2664,Wonderful!,we took advantage of the fastpass plan this time and it was so worth it we will definitely visit again ,5,2018-05-28
2665,Great Experience,where adults can be kids must see matterhorn bobsled hyperspace mountain star tours big thunder mountain railroad haunted house indiana jones adventure and splash mountain,5,2018-05-27
2666,Very crowded not worth the money,paid extra for the maxpass not worth it the fast pass system is broken a lot of the time you wait longer then standby,2,2018-05-27
2667,Handicap kinda welcome,my daughter s knees dislocate and so she was in a wheelchair the people working the shuttle buses were amazing the ones running the rides were hit and miss i had a party of five three of us big girls and two skinny at the teacups and the haunted mansion there was no concern about whether my hanicapped daughter and our group made it completely or safely into the seats of the ride one of us almost got hurt at hm and one of us lost our place to ride at teacups so busy we only got on seven rides in hours only two of the rides eligible for fast passes went may also paid flex for ca adventures to find false advertising on tv because the pixar stuff was not done overall felt like walt is rolling in his frozen tube the workers were about not caring and amazing and the difference was that vast no in between we also spent well over ,2,2018-05-27
2668,"Overrated, overpriced, creepy.",what a let down after coming all the way from australia and spending close to usd to go for just days we were disappointed with the original disneyland nothing like what you expect the place is creepy the rides are average and scary as in weird not as in exciting scary and not great for kids under at all we were much more impressed the second day with california adventure park which is the second part of disneyland much more like what we expected rides were great not creepy and had more themed sections that kids could relate to but overall not overly impresssed i would recommend california adventure park but not original disneyland two stars and not one star only because adventure park was good otherwise overrated way overpriced and original disneyland was just creepy ,2,2018-05-27
2669,The most broken place on earth,hours wasted only to be told the ride we were waiting on was closing experienced this eight times on memorial day weekend one ride failed as we were boarding failures in both parks all for the low low price of per day us and six in our party do the math disney truly needs to get their act together and fix their gear a hugh disappointment ,2,2018-05-26
2670,Too many people!,we went on a week day in may before school was out it was so crowded that you had to wait plus hours for most rides in hours we went on two it would have been but after hours space mountain broke down and they weren t sure how long it would be until it opened if you want to see the parade best to grab a place to hours ahead of time or you ll be behind so many people you ll only hear the noise ,3,2018-05-26
2671,"We had a lot of fun, but it was really crowded",we went with our girls for a one day pass this week we had a lot of fun the last time i had been to disney was years ago when i was a kid i have to say disney has made some definite positive changes it s much much easier to meet characters now and the app makes finding things a lot easier maxpass was definitely worth the extra money for us since we were only there for one day the disney cast was amazing my little wasn t tall enough for the matterhorn so they offered us a rider switch so my husband and i could both get a chance to ride my oldest decided she didn t want to ride again so we skipped it at roger rabbit s my oldest needed to make an emergency potty trip so when i told the cast member he had us wait to the side for her to get back with my husband so we didn t have to go through the line again the evening did get uncomfortably crowded disney needs to consider tracking the number of people actively in the park and restricting evening admission if there are getting to be too many people in the park i know not a popular moneymaking opinion but i guarantee it would improve the experience for people in the park we plan to go back eventually but we ll also definitely hit california adventure the next go round ,4,2018-05-26
2672,Magical... and Heavily Crowded,i asked myself if i really needed to review my favourite place on earth really we always enjoy our time here our latest trip was without children and we took things easy since we ve been on all the rides a few times over each disneyland is our vegas truly however we noticed that at times it seemed overly crowded as in shoulder to shoulder with other humans continuously crowded it became overwhelming at times not to mention unnerving i believe disney may need to start capping attendance at times it didn t feel safe and that s not the disney we have come to love one of the days we were there we literally were able to get onto five rides five and we had a hopper pass it was just so busy by them being greedy and packing people into the park it really detracts from the enjoyment and safety of it turning the most magical place on earth into a scary stressful chore of an experience that s a bit sad to be honest at early entry we saw people forcibly push others out of the way as they ran towards the rides it was shameful families running dragging their sleepy kids to rides so that they wouldn t have to wait in minute lineups with them later side note some parents really need to check themselves and get a grip it s disneyland not the bloomin apocalypse will we return of course we will always consider it our happy place our expensive and crowded happy place ,4,2018-05-26
2673,Truly magical,we went with our two toddlers there s not much that they can ride with or without a fast pass small world though was great with the kids the princess meet and greets were the highlight of our visit the five princesses that we met went above and beyond to make our kids especially our daughter feel special like they were the only ones around and weren t wanting to just get it over with and move on to the next kid however the roger rabbit ride in toon town is not for the little kids i was actually a bit scared for them in there i do however wish there were more photographers around at the meet and greets to make the photo pass worth the money more fast pass rides would be a nice and welcome addition ,4,2018-05-26
2674,Crowded and long lines. 70 minutes for popular rides in off season.,we ve been to disney land many times it was the same as always i noticed it wasn t quite as sparkling clean as i remember but it s not dirty or anything we went on tuesday may th and it was super crowded pirates was closed space mountain was closed for awhile and scheduled to open in a couple hours and the line was super long thunder mt was a minute wait according to the sign but it was longer small world sign said minutes but it was min it wasn t that hot but if it was and you had to stand in line all that time it would be miserable there are other things to do where you don t have to stand in long lines like the monorail and the train and you can see the sites i noticed it was about bucks for a sandwich bring your mickey and minnie ears which everyone wears ,4,2018-05-25
2675,"A joke, too expensive and needs refurbishment!",i came here with my family whilst they were on vacation i knew it was going to be busy however it s not good value for money you spend most of the day queuing and waiting for one or two rides that last minutes the cost of the ticket is not worth it they hype up the experience and mostly sell you rubbish a lot of people expect a dreamy exciting fairytale it s just not the case don t go ,1,2018-05-25
2676,Always Magical Just Way Too Crowded,thought we might miss some of the summer crowds by going before school was out bad idea many of the california schools brought busloads of students every day so lines were ridiculously long both to get through security then through admissions and then for nearly every attraction you want to go on the security process there is a joke the first day it was so busy that they didn t even have us go through metal detectors the second day they made some people go and some not and the third day was different still poor handling and the security staff was generally very rude the park s process for roping areas off for parades and fireworks was really silly too made no sense and caused more congestion than it relieved if you don t mind waiting min to hours for an attraction no problem i would prefer to go at a less busy time and get more bang for my buck fireworks were amazing ,4,2018-05-25
2677,Christmas Time is the bomb,this was my nd time my wife s st for a christmas themed visit we love what they do during the holidays our kids my be grown by we are still kids at hart if you haven t yet visit the park during the holidays ,5,2018-05-25
2678,Oversubscribed and overcrowded,i m pretty sure mr disney would not be a happy bunny if he saw his parks today i ve come over miles and paid through the nose to stand in line at rehashed rides and over pay for any food or beverages this is smaller than orlando has limitations due to the availability of real estate nearby but and this is a huge but for the money i paid for a one day park hopper the amount of profit disney make they need to limit the parks capacity that s both parks fast pass is a swizz and you need to plan really well if you still insist on getting one the only redeeming light is the cast members who make the experience bearable ,2,2018-05-25
2679,Such a fun time for the family,great place definitely not worth it to get the park hopper for the same day we went to disneyland first and by pm we went to california adventure and there were no fast passes available until pm by then everything was super crowded disneyland itself was really fun we went right as the park opened and got on most of the rides my fav was splash mountain the davey crockett canoes were fun but tiring you have to row yourself and everyone is always out of sync or splashing there are people there to take photos of you everywhere but there is always a line definitely gets the most crowded in the afternoon ,5,2018-05-25
2680,First time visit to California Disney parks,first time visit to california disneyland parks my husband and i very much enjoyed the parks we made sure we tried out every ride and attraction that we could from open to close of each day we had tickets well worth the sore feet and legs ,5,2018-05-24
2681,Crazy busy,we had a four day pass and i was basically done after the second day the place was crawling with people i had a scooter to share with my husband and people just kept cutting us off line ups galore at each ride even the fast passes were minute wait cars ride was min wait with fast pass i don t think i ll return to disneyland once is enough for me ,2,2018-05-24
2682,I always have a good time at the original Disneyland Park,since the s my family and i enjoyed disneyland visiting main street u s a and taking a ride at the monorail is a rendezvous with u s history i recommend this theme park to all ,5,2018-05-24
2683,Disneymoon!,my husband and i spent our honeymoon here we frequent disney world so when we had the opportunity to go to disneyland we were very excited i loved the history of the park i love the vintage feel with some of the original rides still there we enjoyed pointing out the similarities and differences the castle is adorable so tiny we enjoyed being able to get almost everything done in one day that was a plus the only thing we had issues with were how unfriendly the cast members were not just one day but the entire time we were there very surprising to us otherwise we enjoyed it very much ,4,2018-05-24
2684,Family Fun,what s not to love about disneyland loved our time in the park the crowds at times were crazy busy but that s all part of it the fireworks were amazing fantasmic is not to be missed if you have young children the bippidy boppidy boutique experience is a must disneyland has plenty to make everyone of all ages smile and have fun ,5,2018-05-24
2685,Magical,disneyland is every bit as magical as you d imagine it to be the scenery music and characters really immerse you into fantasy however a few things to take note of signposting for rides is very poor especially ride entrances wear comfy footwear cannot stress this enough and make sure you take rest breaks and drink plenty of water i would recommend fastpass as the lines get really long a few rides broke down before we could ride them so we missed out on a few so go to the rides you really want go on first so you don t miss out if you have back or neck issues don t ride matterhorn bobsleds because it s very jerky great ride though ,4,2018-05-24
2686,"Fun,but take a few days to enjoy",this runs along the same review i gave for california adventure park too many people on weekends which makes it tedious trying to fit in the rides even with the fast pass ,4,2018-05-23
2687,Had a great day! Everything is super expensive!,as a southern californian i have been to disneyland many many times over the years plusses for today got there when ticket booths opened bought our tickets then had time for some breakfast at downtown disney got in line to get in when we noticed that they were already letting people through even though not opening time yet turns out they let you in to the park but not near any of the rides yet however this was a real time saver as we were able to get very close to the entry to tomorrowland and go directly to hyperspace mountain when it opened literally walked on will definitely plan to be there before opening time next time purchased the fastpass app to get fast passes by phone little bit of a downside there you can only get one fast pass at a time last time we went you could get hold fast pass tix for rides at once turned out we didn t need the fast pass used it anyway but lucked out for some reason and lines this morning were super short rode space mountain star tours buzz lightyear haunted house indiana jones jungle boat it s a small world for old times sake and the train all within the first hours saw a couple of things that might have old walt rolling in his grave obvious light out one eyeball in it s a small world topiary there is a little worse for wear as well one screen not working in indiana jones ride prices are crazy just to park but universal studios charges so there is that ears on a headband but then what do you expect main tip definitely plan your trip there ahead of time so you re not standing around trying to figure out what to do next use the ride wait time app when you get there to help you fine tune everything ,4,2018-05-23
2688,Experience the magic at least once,i ve been to disney world when i was a child a long time ago but husband had not and wanted to experience magic for himself i chose one day park hopper tickets on a value day as well as the extra money for the maxpass hoping it would not be crowded but it seemed like everyone had the same idea i ve never seen so many people before it took about minutes in line to even get through the security gate and then we stood there overwhelmed there is no clear signs about where to enter either park or workers to ask questions when we did figure at the entrance there were longer lines to enter there too i recommend you download the disneyland app and plot out a plan on how to cover the park the fast pass is a slightly good concept you still have to wait in line a significant amount of time to get the pass as well the ride once you do i had to find a worker which was difficult to show me how to do the maxpass on my phone it s is convenient to make ride selections on your phone but i did not like that you couldn t make multiple choices even if another ride was at a later time had to wait about an hour between each selection but i still think it s worth it if you plan on going on the major rides learned later that you could use the fast pass anytime between the timeframe given like any amusement park the food and souvenirs are overpriced but here maybe a little more than needed the park can be accomplished in about days so i m not sure about getting passes longer than that for the park hopper i comment in another review i made about the california adventure park but looking back if you want to do that park too then a day pass from about pm we were able to do the rides it s a small world star wars tour ride indiana jones jungle safari boat and soaring we also ride the monorail ate at buffet restaurant in new orleans theme area and snack food a a few areas throughout did some brief shopping at a few stores and saw some shows parades on the streets by then we were done we didn t want to stand in a long time in line for another minute ride and we met some family and friends in downtown disney for dinner overall we got enough of the experience we wanted in a one day pass ,4,2018-05-22
2689,"Love it, go early so beat the line",i love this disneyland very big but you just need to go early as soon as they open so you can beat the line and the crowd disney is beautiful and make sure stay for the firework it is so so beautiful when the firework comes out at nigh ,5,2018-05-22
2690,The Happiest Place on earth,what an amazing place it was great to see the streets where walt disney had walked and ride the attractions he worked on it was magical we arrived before opening and the gates opened at giving us time to walk to the rope drop area because of this we managed to ride rides before our am breakfast we visit the plaza in which was amazing we stayed in park until pm using fast pass and trying to avoid the crowds disneyland has to be experienced if you are a disney fan even if it s just for the disney history ,5,2018-05-22
2691,ADA Complaint,i am very disappointed in disneyland and the response that was given to us in regards to an ada issue that transpired between a cast member paul at it s a small world and us he took it upon himself to decide that my kids was not handicapped and removed our red tag indicating special needs and then hid my kids stroller the attached photo was the generic canned apology that disney provided without even mentioning what the issue was and this was only provided when prompted and pushed for shame on you disney especially to a family that holds unrestricted annual passes ,1,2018-05-22
2692,It's A Small World,i still enjoy the ride it s a small world the first time i saw it was about years ago and i always go on whenever we are in disneyland i find the children really enjoy the ride ,5,2018-05-22
2693,Disney,we visited for just as day and did both parks but this is because we didn t go on many rides if you want to do more rides definatly look at fast pass and or staying longer ,4,2018-05-22
2694,All about the money! Taking your bench!,we went on a monday there are a lot of people even tough it s not june yet the wait on most rides was about minutes we did get fast pass everything is expensive you will need to come with a lot of money or big credit card a bag of cotton candy is if you get pink it is otherwise a turkey leg is over the merchandise is expensive also a sweet shirt is to depending on if it has a zipper or not the magnets are about the rides are fun and you do have somewhat of a good time however you won t want to go back the park in orlando is much bigger they had fireworks here at but it only lasted about minutes it lasted about minuets in orlando they were taking your bench away so they could make reserved seating for special guests that paid them more money this was to view the fireworks this is a horrible thing to do they should have moved these benches before the park opened rather than pull them out from under us it would be better yet if they did not reserve seats for groups paying extra they did this for the parade also shame on disney for doing this we have a day ticket so i guess we have to go back i have not heard much good about the california park too many rides broke down this will be our last time to disneyland as disney world is much better except for the lack of benches in florida we can t recommend disneyland ,1,2018-05-22
2695,Disneyland never fails to amaze us..,the day was filled with amazing experiences always something new and more amazing around the corner get there early the lines are long as you get to opening time try and budget atleast days to get through most everything just way to much to see and do if you re autograph hunting be prepared for long lines no selfie sticks allowed inside ,5,2018-05-22
2696,Sardine City,went to disney on a monday in may hoping for reduced crowds and many rides it was packed couldn t walk freely due to prams and scooters queues for rides toilets food etc went on rides and other attractions in hours eventually left in disgust when no decent ride was less than an hour wait returned after pm and it was different smaller queues and did rides in minutes especially when the fireworks distracted the masses go at night if you are there for the full disney vibe it s a great day but if you are there for the rides look elsewhere ,3,2018-05-22
2697,Daughters third birthday 💝💖💝,stunning place to spend my daughters birthday the kindness from the staff to the quality you expect from disney i would like to mention the extra care from a member of staff his name is mitchel from harbor city on his name tag he saw it was my daughters birthday and personally took care of us for no reason other than job satisfaction what a guy thank you ,5,2018-05-21
2698,My Dream Holiday,the park is full of fun and well organized we came during what was a low time and it was still long waits for rides do your research before coming to see how to spend your time the best way that works for you i was pleased with how well they were able to make even waiting for rides interesting there is also free wifi everywhere so get an app to distract yourself and group the rides were mostly up with a couple down for maintenance they were able to open a few up earlier than anticipated but there were hiccups along the way the staff seemed well trained to deal with thea hiccups the rides here are more classic disney and for those that are adults now and have seen most of the disney animated library there are little nods everywhere to enjoy as well as new pixar pieces throughout ,5,2018-05-21
2699,Type 1 Diabetics Beware: Disneyland is not friendly to you.,we decided to take our full family on a trip to disney mom dad adult daughter and her spouse y o y o dogs best thing about our trip was the kennel at disneyland clean staff was friendly and very affordable all except one of our family has been to disneyland california adventures we purchased the trip through costco travel so i can t complain one bit about the ticket price and hotel cost year old is a type diabetic and last trip they accommodated this illness splendidly this go round was an overall disappointment went to city hall to see about accommodations and the female staff was polite but more or less said too bad but enjoy your visit with your diabetic didn t expect special treatment but without any accommodations made it difficult to maintain good blood sugar levels when the entire day is spent standing in long lines we were told that the rest of our party could save a place in line for her if she needed to attend to her symptoms get real disney staff while we did use fastpass options our first day monday may we were able to get onto popular rides only and were onsite for over hours spouse had a brain tumor removed about days prior his right leg was still weak from the procedure so we finally ended up renting a wheelchair to ease his discomfort i appreciated the ability to get a return time for a ride and had few problems with this accommodation different story when you use a fastpass and the wheelchair entrance while staff was overall friendly about it you do get pushed to the side and placed on hold until they deem fit to grant you access would have been faster to use the fastpass normally didn t stress about it with the return time procedure as you typically were told to return prior to the standby wait time last time here we commented on how clean the parks were still the same but i am seeing some of the rides and attractions are showing wear and tear and fading paint colors also noticed that staff were somewhat disgruntled whether this is from poor wages hours or constant torture from errant children and inattentive parents it placed a sour note for all of my family let s talk about strollers stroller parking areas stroller drivers stroller right of ways think there might be a new disneyland area called stroller sarcophagus heaven forbid you try to walk through an area that is deemed a walkway because stroller parking lot is the new norm attempting this with someone in a wheelchair is not for the faint of heart forget about being injured on an attraction walking to them was where we all received bumps scratches and bruises as souvenirs for the day sad to say that the pirates ride was closed for refurbishment during our visit there wasn t as many characters to visit with as in past trips either thank heavens we did get to take a picture with captain jack though didn t use the photo pass option so you were told to quickly move along maybe because my kids are older but disneyland was not as enjoyable as in past visits the parks seemed so much more commercially centered then when it was about walt s original vision sad especially for the cost of admission one member of our party s pass stopped working at the fastpass kiosk was told to go to city hall for replacement regardless of it being our final day in the park the staff issued a paper ticket and then kept the souvenir pass when it was asked to be returned as a keepsake was told that they couldn t do that we asked for a supervisor and were told that there wasn t one available as they are all supervisors in city hall when questioned further about this the staffer then became flustered being caught in a lie so she said there was nothing further she or anyone could do for us as the other members of our group already had a fastpass for the ride could we get another one for this member she flat out said it wasn t possible frustrating to say the least california adventures day was better but with the rollercoaster and ferris wheel being closed for refurbishment there really wasn t a lot of options for us as we didn t have little kids to placate or need to join the stroller brigade california adventures was dwindled down to lots of eating options expensive alcohol and roughly attractions to hold our interest unless we paid to shop all day highlight of our day here was the parade attendant who put on the best comedy and dance routine while directing pedestrian traffic before the parade last thing to note be prepared to be pushed out of the parks after the parade or fireworks there is no way to get to a different land other than the gates with the way you re driven like cattle and jockeying for position between the stroller brigades the fireworks display is great but would it be too much to ask if you closed the umbrellas for more people to be able to view the images on the castle will we be back yes but better prepared with strategies to get around the park platinum admission cards and shin guards for nefarious strollers drivers and passengers may the force be with me ,3,2018-05-21
2700,Amazing!!,well let s just say i left here a disney fan having been very unsure about the trip ha it is absolutely amaazing the experiences rides are so unbelievably made that you can t not have the most unreal time the staff and atmosphere is second to none it is for all ages and i truly enjoyed myself i think the prices were reasonable some places similar to these can over charge but i just think it was worth every penny you can also get free fast passes if you are willing to come back to the rides are a different time this was sometimes easier i think in most places like this you wait hourssss and it can become boring but it is super controlled here and you don t feel like your waiting that long i would recommend indiana jones as that was just unbelievable and i have to say galaxy of the guardians although i wouldn t go on it twice ha it is just a fab atmosphere and i would recommend to everyone of all ages hats off to everyone here they make your time amazing all going above and beyond ,5,2018-05-21
2701,"Enjoy your visit, do not rush...",the original and still the best don t arrive with unrealistic expectations after many visits to the parks i have learned that you have to enjoy your family and friends time do not expect to move easily from one ride to another without a wait or at least expect some delays do not try to ride and see everything you will only become frustrated and disappointed pick and choose which rides that you want to go on and which shows or parades that you want to see plan your days know the schedule of your shows rides and parades get the fastpass for your rides early if your schedule allows but do not be so regimented that you do not adjust your schedule if necessary you may need to reserve a spot for your parades or shows maybe with a blanket shirt backpack or shopping bag and sit there and wait if possible ask cast members for suggestions on better seating and the best points of view they are there to help you and plan on spending several days to enjoy the parks with a multi day park hopper enjoy your time in the park realize that certain times of the year and of the day will be more crowded than others it is all part of the total experience ,5,2018-05-20
2702,Kid Again,this is the only place where you can be a kid again plus it was extra special to watch your grand kids experience it for the first time love disneyland ,5,2018-05-20
2703,Packed - Tip for Family first timers,hire the vip tour guide it is so worth it for family s that have been there for the first time it is an hour ask for mark he has been there a long time and is the best we will be back and will book with him as our tour guide again ,4,2018-05-20
2704,Fast pass issues and ride breakdowns gigantic strollers,wait in line for an hour as as they let fast pass holders in by the dozen and stand bys at a time not cool also after waiting or getting a fast pass ride breaks down and no compensation and then there are the countless strollers dual and triple wide thatplow through everyone oh and also countless grad nights going on they should publish this information so one can gauge their visit accordingly as the park fees are extremely high ,3,2018-05-20
2705,Another great visit,we were there with group of year old from school trip so including a single parent with every child it was a big group that pretty much made it fun as when you are with large group the whole waiting in the line goes much faster as everyone is talking to each other and making the time goes faster overall the park was very busy in the middle of the week and summer is not here yet but we had a great time food was average as usually so you get a good food but price is up there that usually is the case for every park but in here at least you get a good quality food you may want to get the fast pass that they offer but you must download the app so you can select the time frame of the rides you like to go and choose that s another thing the fast pass gives you fast access to the selected ride in the time frame you choose it s not like you can select it and show up and pass everyone else you must show up in the time frame you selected on the disneyland app on your phone some of us were confused about that fact so i hope this review helps you out overall the part was clean well managed with cleaning and security food and assisting people with direction and every question they had as usually we had a great time and i am sure we ll be back as who can stay away from disneyland s magic ,5,2018-05-20
2706,Happiest place on Earth,you know it is this is the only place money can buy happiness a small large price to pay for said happiness ,5,2018-05-20
2707,Great surprise for me,during a recent trip to los angeles my hubby surprised me with a visit to disneyland we had gone there almost years ago and this was a fun day for me the prices are outrageous so bring your own water bottle and fill it up at the water fountains otherwise you will pay for a bottle of water we actually stayed nearby at a reasonably priced motel and walked there so we avoided the parking fees be sure to invest in the fast pass which will allow you to avoid the long lines for the rides we had to wait at least minutes for rides which takes up most of your time two of the rides broke down one we were just exiting and the other we were next to get on this was a disappointment but i was told it happens often enjoyed our visit and do stop in some of the shops we found a couple of sweatshirts at reasonable prices as it got really chilly in the evening ,3,2018-05-19
2708,The Misery Of Disney,visited disneyland on thursday may th as part of a honeymoon trip along the west coast was completely astounded by the sheer amount of people i ve never visited a theme park that was so busy it was especially annoying as we made sure to visit before the school holiday it seems there s no good time to visit all the reviews keep mentioning the magic of disney which blows my mind there was seriously nothing magical about the experience we shuffled along most of the day and tried to make the best out of an excruciating experience minimum queue time on the rides was minutes for space mountain we queued hour and minutes every ride we came across had a staggering queue time i couldn t believe people actually returned to this park for fun it was boring af please save yourself the time and misery if you don t want to waste at least hours queuing for rides ,1,2018-05-19
2709,Great 5 day hopper pass,loved the fast pass system if you know how to use properly it is very effective park is clean and the staff are really well trained my only disappointment was the pirates of caribbean ride was closed it was the only ride i remembered when i went as a child,5,2018-05-19
2710,Forever a Disney fan!!,this was my second time to disneyland i just love love love it there is so much to see do you can t help but feel like a big kid the customer service is amazing the place is so clean if anyone had a birthday was wearing a badge every staff member would wish them a happy birthday the street entertainment especially the parade fantasmic the marching band are truly wonderful they really out do themselves it really is the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-05-19
2711,Not the happiest place on earth!,we had a very disappointing experience at disneyland my husband needs an ecv because of heath issues he cannot walk for long periods at a time where you have to rent them is a long walk from where you get off the tram we get inside and there are strollers everywhere it is so hard to maneuver around them and if you need to park your ecv good luck i asked one employee where to park it at the peter pan ride and he says it is a minute wait for the ride what i told him i am aware of that we are willing to wait where can my husband park his ecv he says by the stroller parking thankfully he did find a place we ate in the french market area for supper and the whole place was messy the tables were dirty and ground covered with powdered sugar and trash while about a dozen people working there had ample time to talk and laugh with each other instead of cleaning up the area the jungle ride was a disaster we waited for minutes to ride and then the employee goes so fast during the ride you didn t have time to look at anything people were trying to take pictures and finally gave up then when the ride is over we have to wait to get off because the boats are backed up hey why don t you go slower during the ride that we waited so long for we have been to disneyworld and it is a much better experience i was expecting the same from disneyland and we were left disappointed in our experience we were thinking about going to disney s california adventure but because of our experience here we didn t want to waste more money by having a bad experience i have always wanted to come to disneyland and can say that i have been here but not worth the money to come back ,2,2018-05-19
2712,Great Mother’s Day !,my son gave me a mother s day gift to go with his family to disneyland it was great to spend two days with grandkids and it brought back memories too what can i say disneyland is still the happiest place on earth i guess the only thing is it is expensive we are the lucky ones who don t have to sweat the admission ticket price and all the add on cost such as maxpass or add on price to get nicer seating for fantasimic shows i wonder how some families afford the high price ,4,2018-05-19
2713,Shocking,in la for a few days and thought what could be better than a visit to disneyland as it turned out anything we went on a thursday and we couldn t believe the crowds this wasn t helped when there were so many strollers in the park i guess disney must have shares in a stroller manufacturer the queues everywhere were horrific we were in the queue for splash mountain and it broke down we did get on it later and it broke down while we were on the ride we went back later and it was broken again the pinocchio ride broke down so we couldn t go in the alien boasters broke down as we queues surprised we didn t have a breakdown we ve been to orlando a few times and it was great we didn t think the french would pull it off in paris but they did this is the worst park we ve been to if you can t get to any of the other parks then visit here but you have been warned waste of money ,1,2018-05-18
2714,Happy! Happy! Happy!,another amazing disney adventure the staff were all amazing and friendly the park was so clean even with the piles of people everywhere a great experience for our group of aged ride reco indiana jones star tours hyperspace mountain thunder rail stay for the fireworks the pixar show is breathtaking and a tear jerker love this place ,5,2018-05-18
2715,The happiest place on earth,alot of walking and spread out attractions it truly is happiest place on earth we rented electric scooters which were a game changer lasted til doors close the firework show is always amazing plaza inn had some good dinner that s more restaraunt quality fast passes are a must,5,2018-05-18
2716,The Disney experience tied up in one Park,we are biased in that we really love wdw and wanted to have the california experience while the park is the original it could certainly use some updating and the level of customer service is not comparable to the pixie dust experience you have in florida staff in this park often looked tired unenthusiastic and frumpy it was not very warm averaging celsius on the days were there but the random selection of worn out outwear we saw on staff was not in keeping with my image of disney ,4,2018-05-18
2717,Heaven for the young and young at heart.,yes it s disney it will be busy it will be pricey and you will certainly have to wait in line a lot but how can you not have a good time anyway i mean it s disneyland i feel silly even reviewing it that being said this was my th time here since i was the food options are better these days and the faspass is a great feature you can manage on your phone for ten bucks more i would say the only thing that has gone downhill over the years is the staff attitude i never used to be able to tell that the staff were over their jobs and this trip i definitely felt more like the herded cattle of bored farmers no on gets into their roles anymore it s too bad i can imagine it s hard to keep a smile on but apparently they do try to switch people around regularly and give lots of breaks to keep them fresh do stay for the fireworks worth it also kids can ride pretty much any ride from a young age so even though we don t have kids we thought that was pretty cool for other families i enjoyed looking around and seeing people from all different ages religions ethnicities and stereotypes from all walks of life enjoying the park and sporting mouse ears ,5,2018-05-18
2718,A great place to visit and have fun,love it never been so it was my first time compared to orlando this place is so small but it was perfect since i had only one day i got to see everything i wanted to see you can get a place to stay very close and actually walk to the park get a hopper pass and trust me that you can walk back and forth all day ,4,2018-05-17
2719,Must get the max pass,buy your tickets online and if you can stay days get the hopper pass and add the max pass once you enter the park you can get a fast pass to an attraction using the disney app we spent two and half days going from disneyland and then california adventure ,5,2018-05-17
2720,Truly Magical!,we loved our visit to disneyland it is so nice to be able to go between parks without having to go through security again we also loved the maxpass option and found that it was a really nice way to cut down on wait time we also loved that all of the ride photopass pictures were included we ve also done disney world and found this to be much less intimidating and really enjoyed it we felt like we were able to see and do everything we wanted unlike disney world where we felt like we had just scratched the surface ,5,2018-05-17
2721,Disneyland really is the happiest place in earth,my young family and i really loved disneyland the staff there are all so kind and friendly they all seemed to go out of their way to assist us with our many questions the rides and experiences were times better than any park in australia i d like to make a special note to thank the staff my year old son was injured in the park on th april when he fell over his own feet walking through the crowded park within seconds of the fall a cleaner used his radio to call for medical assistance minutes later a nurse and first aid officers were on scene and then only a minute later ambulance paramedics were on scene my son had to be taken to hospital but the care the staff from disneyland offered was first class thank you we had a day park hopper we came to the park for days and loved every moment there was about people in the park at one time which makes it very very crowded you can line up for some rides for hours i highly recommend the fast passes if you can get them the park does offer wifi but the wifi drops out all the time there are lots and lots of black spots for a park that encourages it s guests to use their cellphone app especially as the park attracts so many international guests that don t have regular cellphone service you d think their wifi would have been better there is loads of places to eat at disneyland but they charge an absolute fortune we ate outside of the park having a big breakfast and dinner therefore not having to spend a fortune inside the park for lunch we also took out own drinks in so we didn t have to pay per drink i still give disneyland a stars i loved every moment and i can t wait to come back again one day when my kids are a bit older ,5,2018-05-17
2722,Relaxing trip to Disneyland for a change!,usually the park is super crowded my wife and i came for a couple days this week may and it was not super crowded and pretty relaxing fun getaway for the two of us ,5,2018-05-16
2723,Happiest Place on Earth,definitely had a blast with my year old niece it was her first time and as always disneyland is fantastic it was crowded but to be expected definitely take advantage of the fast pass system if you can they will cut your wait time prices are very expensive to get in the park and parking is a little expensive as well for the day and good cost are very high but some places are worth the price ,4,2018-05-16
2724,Disney is always perfect and a great family experience- we cannot tell you enough about this place.,fun fun fun walk till you drop if you are thinking about going do it sometimes there is never a good time so you have to make it happen you will not regret it disneyland is for all ages and all incomes bring a pack lunch in for the day and bottled water if you want and snacks so you can snack all day we usually bring healthy bars and nuts with us to get us through the day things not to miss tiki room dole ice cream the best bit easy to miss thunder mountain and the fireworks and parade never gets old ,5,2018-05-16
2725,Vintage Disney,i am a huge disney parks fan and a passholder at disney world i wanted to visit the original this is a great way to experience what walt first envisioned you can walk right onto property from the street it is classic disney and great for any disney fan if i had to choose between disneyland and disney world i would take disney world hands down but i can say i was able to visit ,4,2018-05-16
2726,Always great memories,another great family trip to disneyland the employees are nice and helpful i have had a different experience every time i have visited ,5,2018-05-16
2727,Nothing beats Disneyland!,we enjoyed a fantastic days at disneyland with our young family the kids loved seeing meeting the disney characters riding on the kid rides and enjoying shows the disney maxpass was a must for getting free copies of all the photos note if you don t need digital fastpass access for everyone in your family a single member can get the maxpass for the free photos at day ,5,2018-05-15
2728,Wait times even with fast pass kill the magic,it is true what they say the place is magical and takes you back to your childhood the queues however suck the life out of you and to me this probably suggests that demand has outgrown supply there were a number of the larger rides closed on our visit including pirates big wheel and california screaming which put additional pressure on other thrill rides we had the fast passes but even with the we probably still only managed rides max in a hour visit this was a weekday not even at the weekend which is presumably worse best ride was the mattahorn and it was cool to go on this after dark,3,2018-05-15
2729,Fun even for 2 year old and 5 month old,disney does not disappoint albeit a very expensive place but it is worth it disney detail is amazing some tips buy ears dresses disney stuff for the kids elsewhere before you get there because it is overpriced ears are before tax get the fries because they were absolutely delicious dole whip float is worth the hype bring your own water pop and snacks pop is be prepared to wait a lot we went on a monday in may and it was packed there were a ton of strollers some kids were way to big for strollers but still sitting in them you can bring your stroller on the tram and sit anywhere if you fold it up but there are designated places if you want to bring the stroller as is on board bit the baby does have to be out buy your tickets in advance to avoid the lineup my daughter was looking forward to frozen characters but they are in the adventure park which is geared for older kids she was so disappointed there s just too much and not enough time we were there from open till close and we missed a lot get the day if it s in your price range parades and shows the streets are just packed and they door in areas and it is just chaos but it is what it is overall we would take our kids back there ,5,2018-05-15
2730,KC Visits the Mouse,our family of went to the parks wed fri on the three day park hopper pass did not really need the park hopper piece because we stayed at disneyland wed and fri and disney california adventure on thurs disneyland was amazing we bought the max passes and for the most part hardly waited in line it was packed all three days the parades and fireworks were magical my only critique is the rides kept breaking down there were at least five rides that we had waited in line for or had a fast pass for that ended up being temporarily closed we never had that problem at disney world in addition watch out for the strollers parents use those things to make there way through the crowd we were all hit several times ,4,2018-05-15
2731,Taken to another world,the brand is unable to be duplicated decades of success every time we go there we feel as if we have travelled out of reality into a kind relaxing fun and most enjoyable escape adventure kudos to not only it s creator but those who continue to create the magic ,5,2018-05-15
2732,Lots To See - Pace Yourself,my kids first disney experience and my second after years was a success only downside is some of the princesses characters where not at their appointed spot at the scheduled time so just keep that in mind and remain flexible also have good walking shoes ,4,2018-05-14
2733,Amazing,paint the night parade is awesome crowds were not to bad after parade had a few rides in bugs life with no one in that section of park yr old grand kids loved it much better than january when main street was boarded up for reno s no parades or fireworks no advice of this,5,2018-05-14
2734,Happiest place on earth!,disneyland is amazing for families the rides are good not too scary so good for little ones lots to see and do you need at least days to see most things if you can take advantage of the fastpass for certain rides you can save time waiting in line and better plan your days when you get to the park in the morning you can get information on park closure times etc one night the park closed an hour early due to a special event and we didn t know ,5,2018-05-14
2735,I am in love!!,i have grown up here and now my kids are too over trips and i still love everything about it this is my happy place ,5,2018-05-14
2736,Just love Disneyland!,it has been decades since i was last here generally visit disney world since i am from east coast or disney euro outside of paris i love the ease of visiting this disney i find disney world overwhelming travel here is so much easier i know that the other park has much more but i genuinely like the simplicity of this one ,5,2018-05-13
2737,Never too old,we had an extended family holiday to disneyland grandparent us parent and children alike a fantastic time for us all proving that you can never be too old to once again be that year old boy that grew up with all of the disney characters fantastic time to do over and over again ,5,2018-05-13
2738,Love Disneyland!,my family visits disneyland almost every year disneyland and california adventure are next to each other so if you wanted to get a park hopper pass you could easily go from one park to the other you can bring in the small plastic bottles of soda bottled water granola bars and lunch size bags of chips which is a huge help if you want to save on snacks we usually eat a big breakfast before heading into the park take snacks book a late lunch early dinner character meal then enjoy park food corn on the cob turkey legs funnel cake mickey mouse ice cream before we leave the park we do save money by bringing our own bottles of water and soda we also save money on some snacks but we do indulge in the fun park food as well after all you are on vacation ,4,2018-05-13
2739,Fun and adventure if you chose the right attractions,i went with my wife and my sister we recommend space mountain and the others rides of tomorrow land everybody must do the indiana jones ride and never forget the matterhorn for eat people can chose between a lot of restaurants i think the best is zocalo every visitor must check the weather before to go sometimes it s cold with wind in these cases a jacket is very important ,5,2018-05-12
2740,Another Magical Visit,great rides although not as intense or long as universal or california park friendly and outgoing staff and great disability access pass option for kids with autism this allowed for the wait for a ride in a virtual cue rather than subjecting our child to a long queue of people ,5,2018-05-12
2741,Disneylannnnd!,what can you say it s disney a great day out we did day at disney and day at the adventure park we had pretty good luck so managed to get through them both in a day each lots of shopping and great food truly the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-05-12
2742,It’s Disney don’t let the map fool you,it s disney what do you expect the oj and the best don t let the map fool you the place is big and the lines are long but they do have shade in the older part of disneyland yes everything is expensive but when they are a monopoly they set the price the shops are interconnected and some repetitive so you can find all merch everywhere to an extent tommorow land and guardians of the galaxy are the best rides they are well organised and security is tight so you feel safe the app is good but it s missing an itinerary like universal studios have their rides are real unlike universal studios simulated rides come here for at least a bucket list tick off,5,2018-05-11
2743,The happiest place on earth.,disneyland really is magical even with the crowds and high prices they do such a great job of making it a memorable and magical experience the big thrill rides are fun and all but be sure and dedicate some time to doing more than just the rides there are fun shows attractions that aren t thrill rides but are so fun character experiences food shopping and just amazing atmosphere it s definitely worth having a full day of just taking it easy and not doing any or very few rides it also makes for a somewhat more relaxed day just enjoying the park go early for rope drop get there mins to an hour before the park officially opens that ll give you time to get through security bag check and then get in line at the main gates they ll open main street minutes before the official park opening time and then cast members will be standing near the castle with the lands roped off gather at the rope and then when the park officially opens the cast members will take the rope away and you ll be one of the first people into the lands most people will run to peter pan if you aren t one of the first people or so there be prepared to wait the line can get up to mins within minutes of rope drop otherwise go enjoy the rest of the park with hardly anyone else around everyone else arriving to the park at opening time will still have to go through a long bag check line and a long line at the gates so you ll have plenty of time to walk onto rides and even more use the max pass system to grab a fast pass for a more popular ride right off you ll be able to use the fast pass within minutes so go walk onto a smaller ride then go use your fast pass and walk on to that ride you ll bypass a small line but still nice not to wait at all as soon as you use your fast pass or as soon as you can use the max pass to grab another fast pass for a bigger ride you can work this system really well in the first couple hours and have most of your rides done by even if you do a no ride limited rides day go for rope drop and just enjoy how empty the park is ,5,2018-05-11
2744,Disneyland Security Screening,if you enjoy the tsa screening process at airports you ll love your visit in fact some items the tsa has no problems with won t pass disney tests case in point a rolled up legged stool about inches long see pictures refused entry strollers the size of small cars no problem seurity wouldn t allow storage in a locker leaving the item outside the screening area or even outside the front gate clear out by the street required me to personally remove the item from disney property even after i told them to throw it away most disney employees seem to go out of their way to make the guest experience great but some of the security staff are unbelievably obnoxious and rude ,1,2018-05-11
2745,The best place on earth,love it love it love it the ticket collectors are glad to see you the park staff the ride attendants everyone is so happy you are there the park is clean and so well set out to see fantasy castle from the top of main street is just the best the rides are brilliant and each park is an adventure in itself don t miss anything go and see all the little shows do all the rides for the little ones and the adults everyone of them is an experience make sure you have a turkey leg which is really ham a frozen lemonade and then an ice cream the candied apples and rice crispy are just amazing and all made with great care and attention to detail try and watch the street parades they are great the fantasmic show is on saturday nights and should not be missed if you can you need to get a fast past near the paddle steamer so you can watch the show the earlier you get it the better spot you have to watch the show from the fire works are just amazing it s a long day from to pm but it s worth every minute ,5,2018-05-11
2746,A Tale of Two Experiences,my previous experience simply was wdw orlando which is indeed magical on most days so when we booked this vacation we made a decision to go to where it all started and glad we did as it was an experience and for most part a wonderful day after the five minutes shuttle ride from the toy story parking lot we first noticed that disneyland dl and disney california adventure dca was separated by basically a little more than a football field with a straight shot to downtown disney and this fact makes it easy to spend all day park hopping and a short walk to downtown disney we entered dl around am on a sunday after eating breakfast in downtown disney at la brea bakery entered easily and main st was filled with joy then you quickly notice the size of the castle is much smaller than mk as is most of dl comparatively speaking max fastpass was on as we quickly got on the most disappointing ride of any disney experience after everything i had ever read about it which was the matterhorn bobsleds one horrible ride and could use updating and quickly thought how the seven dwarfs mine train in mk would become an instant upgrade and star for dl the first four hours in dl was amazing as we were riding everything and we actually rode everything we wanted to within that first four hours excluding splash mountain because it had an issue and they stated it would be approximately minutes before it was back up they did honor that fastpass with any in the park and thus space mountain again space mountain and big thunder are brilliant and felt smoother and while similar indeed a touch better than mk and we did enjoy the indiana jones ride at dl by pm dl became a complete zoo and thus the tale of two experiences it was so busy the rest of the day and we did not leave until pm we had park hopper tickets and arrived at dca around we spent four hours total in dca and most of our time waiting in dl we took a hour break to eat and then the fantasmic experience which we spent around a hour and fifteen minutes between getting a good seat and then watching the estimated thirty minute show and it was well worth it so dl was brilliant and so fun those first four hours and then a complete zoo and so crowded it was hard to move within the park we enjoyed the architecture and beauty the different lands are great and riding the mark twain was a nice break and relaxing with no line to take such a break it was smaller and easy to cover until it was so crowded it was hard to move adventure land frontier land and tomorrow land all reminded me of mk and they were fantastic all in all i am glad i went and while similar experience to mk still different i will always remember those first four hours fantasmic and the fireworks show and with that enjoy disneyland ,4,2018-05-10
2747,First Disneyland Trip!!,i gave it stars only because when we got there it was our first day and one of the picture lady came up to us by the castle as me and my family were taking pictures with our selfie stick she interrupts and says guys i am sorry but i m going to have to take that from you or get security that isn t allowed in the park sorry that s the policy i was so shocked and pissed my husband told her why didn t anyone at security check tells us anything can we please put it away in the stroller she said no i need to take it from you or call security she so rude we said then we will feel better throwing it away than giving it to you and she said we can t do that either smh worst experience ever and fastpasses should be available all day long for multiplier rides not just a certain time to come back and ride ,3,2018-05-10
2748,Who doesn't love Disneyland,we love disneyland we are there about twice a year and we do one day at disney and one at california adventure we like to move fast so we do both park in a day and run all over the place we end up pretty tired but that s how we like to go about doing disneyland ,5,2018-05-10
2749,AMAZING customer service,this is our first time here and the cast members at the ticketing gate tiffany and mike were so helpful best customer service i ve ever had at a big park like this and we will definitely return ,5,2018-05-10
2750,WAY too Crowded with Locals,disney s decision to practically give away annual passes to locals has ruined disneyland it used to be the happiest place on earth now with locals jamming the attractions every day even mid week on cloudy days during school there is no longer a good time to go it is aggravating to know that you paid about the same price for a three day pass as the locals paid for a one year pass disney needs to increase the annual pass cost to decrease crowd sizes by about it s just not fair and it s just not fun with that many people what used to be a magic kingdom is now just an amusement park due to the crowds of locals who drop in all the time ,2,2018-05-10
2751,Too crowded too expensive,if you want to pay and spend most of your day lining up this is your place we spent hours and only could do rides a total shame and terrible memory for the kids we will never be back,2,2018-05-09
2752,Trip to La,i found this disney to be smaller than disneyworld it was super similar but still had its differences due to size we were able to complete all the things we set out to accomplish during our visit if it s your first visit ask one of the shops for a st visit button and if you are lucky enough to spend your birthday here like i was ask for a birthday button too they are free ,4,2018-05-09
2753,You just have to go !!,a real life experience whether you are an adult or teen or a kid for sure you ll enjoy it helpful stuff sometimes sleepy lol but they are humans always smiling at you loooooads of rides to take and different difficulty levels food to be honest extremely expensive and overpriced same like the souvenirs but expected that when you are there make sure you go early to catch one or two rides before the lines starts plan for days visit if you wanna see and play everything wait for the parade and the fire works so much fun ,5,2018-05-09
2754,Much Too Crowded!,one would think that going to disneyland on a monday would mean less of a crowd than on a weekend well it appears that i thought wrong in this case instead of the teens and tweens that dominate during the weekend disneyland on a perfect weather monday was packed with adults playing hooky from work and families with preschool aged children this meant that fantasyland especially was particularly chaotic fantasyland was developed in a time before gigantic side by side twin strollers and it showed there were a few places that weren t that crowded such as main street usa and the monorail tips if you really want to ride a particular ride either try to get in on the early morning one hour before the park officially opens or get a fastpass as soon as the park officially opens we didn t for splash mountain and we didn t want to wait minutes to ride so we missed it ,3,2018-05-08
2755,Happiest Birthday Ever,my son and i visited disneyland for his th birthday i have been to disney world several times and took him there is but this was our first visit to this park it was amazing we had so much fun everyone was so nice i made sure to get him a pin stating it was his birthday and first trip he was wished happy birthday by all of the cast members we met he loved it i paid extra for the max pass and it was more than worth it i have so many pictures to remember the trip plus using my phone for fast pass tickets was a lifesaver we were able to ride most of the most popular with little to no wait i can t wait to go back ,5,2018-05-08
2756,Biggest commercial show ever,at all the disney ressort is the biggest commercial thing i ever saw they try to make money with all put a disneysign on a t shirt and yes you have to pay the food is that expensive that you better bring your own examples one churro that ones from mexico are much better a piece of pizza more than what the hell is this all this commercial things are a shame at all in front of kids the shows and parades are the most stupid you csn imagine anyone saw the simpsons in the themeparks now i know and understand this episides the fun factor is going down rapidly when you see the long lines the fast pass is obe good thing but only available every some hours the best thing in the park even when it is expensive is the bratwurst with sauerkraut we was buying a day ticket much expensive and really you dont need it btw you can see every night a big firework what is making pollution in the air and a big noise pollution and this in the green state california think about at all a big commercial something i did not see again pretended happines exepensive senseless stuff and long lines this is the world of disney yes ,2,2018-05-08
2757,A blast! Even for a 2 year old.,we had a great time at disneyland our son was at the time of t he trip and he was able to do so many of the rides definitely get the disneyland app and do the maxpass saves a ton of time and you get free ride photographer photos ,5,2018-05-08
2758,Disney says it all!,fantastic fun whether you are by yourself with a friend or a family something for everyone could be a little more shade around the place as fair skinned people were suffering on the hot sunshine ,5,2018-05-08
2759,Vacation,even with a family of with the youngest of the lot being years of age we all had a fantastic time that we ll never forget i highly recommend disney land to anyone of any age the food cafes were delicious and reasonably priced and the rides were awesome i can t wait to go again with my own children,5,2018-05-08
2760,Disneyland encourages you to BELIEVE in dreams,disneyland is the place where both adults and children can let their inner child believe in magic this is our th time at disneyland make the most of the fast pass ride tickets the queues for rides can be very long with waits up to mins or more on popular rides if you have an early morning entry pass organize yourself to make the most of this time in order to ride your favourite rides or to get a fast pass for that special ride remember everyone else is there doing the same food can be a bit on the expensive side if you ve got a family take a few snacks and drink beware of the baby strollers there are thousands of them and not everyone should have a license to control one wear shin pads lol if your wanting see the parade people start finding and staking out places along the route curb side in order to get the optimal position up to hours before the parade starts it s the pixar fest currently till september i personally prefer the disney parade rather than the pixar parade which is being paraded at the moment of the staff were friendly and helpful with a ready smile the other seemed unhelpful with the constant queries of the crowds the fire works are fabulous and are worth staying for nightly remember these can be weather dependent ,5,2018-05-07
2761,BEST DAY EVER.,it truly is the happiest place on earth ticket prices were higher as went on peak day but so worth it first timer going it was incredible to experience it as an adult felt like i was years old again seeing my idols for the first time the castle is the smallest of all the parks but only because of the history of the park it was the first ever park walt disney opened which i think it amazing considering there is now a number of resorts worldwide wear comfortable shoes as lots of walking and obviously waiting for rides worth waiting until for the first firework display it is amazing would definitely return to this park if not another one before ,5,2018-05-07
2762,Amazing,dream come true highly recommend doing fast passes for the main rides also stay for fantasmic and the if going soon the together forever pixar friends fireworks shows we brought a unlimited fast pass and photo pass which saved us a lot of time and managed to get all the rides we wanted to get done plus more also get the lemonade as it is delicious and corn dogs too,5,2018-05-07
2763,Quick response,it was hot very crowded and my husband hurt his back i stop and asked one of the shopkeepers for help immediately a nurse security personnel we were given a ride back to our hotel we are so thankful quick response,3,2018-05-07
2764,Wonderful time!,disneyland never disappoints it s clean family friendly environment with entertaining rides is a great way to escape the routine of life for a day i definitely recommend getting there when the park opens as many rides can be conquered in the first hour before the park gets really busy ,5,2018-05-07
2765,Always great,we went on a monday beautiful sun crowds moderate use disney s app and per ticket on app for max pass it will improve your experience greatly and be easier on the bod the new soaring is great as well as cars my th time at disneyland,5,2018-05-07
2766,PixarFest was FANTASTIC!,though the tickets are pricey and have gone up every year maximise your trip with the maxpass it is worth every cent ,5,2018-05-07
2767,Magic (almost),we visited disneyland on monday april we arrived before the park opened and left after the fireworks we utilized the maxpass fastpass and had a great day we visited california adventure on tuesday may we loved it but were disappointed that we paid full price for a ticket we knew that somethings would be closed because of construction and remodeling we were not happy when other rides were closed too we hop to return at some point because other than that we had another opening to close day the night fireworks at disneyland and the pixar nighttime parade at caliadv were incredible ,5,2018-05-07
2768,Magical,always a magical experience clean and friendly workers the fastpass system works fairly well the queue to get in on the morning is no fun ,5,2018-05-07
2769,Even better than I remember!,i had not been to disney land since and i was so glad i got to go again this trip was on the front end of a business trip and we had two days to play the cast members were friendly and helpful not as good as florida but still good the rides were fun and my wife and i felt like kids again ,5,2018-05-07
2770,ONCE AGAIN DISNEY REMOVES A GOOD FOOD ITEM,cafe orleans nice lobster salad gone choices getting worse let s review a few other dining deaths because they are actually good and disney does not like to spend money on good food lobster salad cafe orleans frito misto alfresco terrace cinnomon rolls disneyland bakery cinnomon roll french toast carnation cafe mahi mahi fish tacos tangaroa terrace cheap small shrimp tacos nice breakfast river belle terrace now an expensive mediocre restaraunt short rib sandwhich carthay circle chili fries with sour cream smokejumpers grill blt flatbread now the red rose taverne fried green tomatoes hungry bear you can get them for x the price at bb i m so sick of disneyland taking away the good things and replacing with obviously cheaper dining options if you want us to spend our dollars in the park improve the dining ,2,2018-05-06
2771,A sea of people and lines.,you re gonna be on your feet in line for rides more than you re gonna be in the rides per se honestly for an adult it is barely worth it i mean if you like the kids rides you re fine but if you re looking for something exciting there are only a couple of rides that are really entertaining including disney california adventure there were a good few rides that weren t working and even more than kind of broke in the middle of the ride pirates of the caribbean wasnt working and the indiana jones got stucked and we missed a part honestly personally i wouldn t go back even if you get the fast passes you don t end up going as fast as you wish you couls because of the way they work i wouldn t pay all that money to go again it was a nice one time experience ,3,2018-05-06
2772,Family trip,great family fun their entrance into the park needs more employees checking bags and scanning the wait was too long to get in ,4,2018-05-06
2773,Better than DisneyWorld,first trip to disneyland and it exceeded my expectations we brought our and year olds and they all had a blast love that it s smaller than dw but still has some of the same classic rides and shows food was pretty good but not outstanding the experiences our kids had with the disney characters here far exceeds disneyworld much more personable and more easily accessible kids had a blast interacting with each character they especially loved toon town we will be back hopefully in year ,5,2018-05-06
2774,Enjoyed the original,enjoyed visiting the original park i highly recommend talking to your disney rep at your hotel before you go especially if you have limited time ,5,2018-05-06
2775,"Amazing family park, but gets a bit crowded.",disneyland park is by far our favorite park that we have ever been to although we generally just go to the parks at the gold coast which don t really compare it s a fantastic place for families as there are rides for all ages plus many attractions and activities happening around the area there are big issues with this park though we went end of april early may when crowds were supposed to be fairly light this is not the case the park was packed on most days that we went which was both during the week and the weekend it really didn t make any difference which meant that the queues could get really big they need to start restricting the access by prams these are a nightmare and parents take them into the park even when their children are way to old for them or don t require them for mobility reasons parents use these to barge through the crowds and create space which is really annoying when they keep running into you all the time they really need to bring in a policy to control this if you can put up with crowds then disneyland is an amazing place to visit just be prepared to wait in queues a lot and pay high prices if you buy merchandise or food in the park tip go to the local malls that have disney shops which sell that same merchandise at a much reduced price ,4,2018-05-05
2776,Waste of money,had a day hopper pass park per day also had the max pass which i think was about per person as there were so many people found it hard to use this pass as the rides seemed to be booked out and the app would only let you book ride an hour the main ride we did book which was for early evening broke down and we couldn t ride it got there at about am and left at pm and only managed to get on rides my tips for going to disney would be get there early and make sure you have everything well organised or it will be a waste of money like it was for us the crowds here are unbelievable ,2,2018-05-05
2777,Magical,every time i go i find new things to love the evenings were wonderful as the lines were shorter the heat had dissipated and there were fireworks to light up the night ,5,2018-05-05
2778,Amazing,yes it s expensive yes it s crowded but that doesn t matter we loved our time here over the xmas period maxpass is awesome and makes getting on the rides you want so much easier plan your day get there early and you ll love it ,5,2018-05-05
2779,"Nostalgic, magical, FUN!!!!",my year old daughter and i vacationed in la jolla but took a day to visit disney we are so glad we did no it isn t disneyworld but it is a wonderful magical place we arrived early and this was key to having a fantastic day we walked on four rides in the first minutes i loved the old school vibe of the entire place and especially main street and the castle you are enveloped in walt s imagination and it felt just right for us our top three rides were indiana jones splash mountain and winnie the pooh and mr toad s wild ride tied for third as other reviews have stated get the max pass and use the app it is a make or break decision if you are considering visiting disneyland don t hesitate you will have memories for life ,5,2018-05-05
2780,Solo Trip to Disneyland,yes it is not as extravagant as disney world but you get to walk the same streets that walt disney did so much history and appreciation going to disneyland is a must for anyone in the area who loves the disney organization and can appreciate it ,5,2018-05-05
2781,Loved it,wonderful loved everything about it clean vibrant professional attention to detail on every ride was great even rides that would be decades old looked new and sparkly like it s a small world loved pirates of the caribbean the detail and work put into the displays pirates is truly amazing best part of our three week trip to usa thanks for living up to a childhood dream xxx,5,2018-05-05
2782,The happiest place on earth,is disneyland worth the hype i really don t know but i love being able to go on rides eat crazy food and act like a kid again so i m going to lean towards yes do it number one tip would be max pass we waited no more than mins in the line by being smart with this and using the app so would recommend you do some research and then download max pass all in all you just can t beat it despite the crowds it s worth it,5,2018-05-05
2783,Why do people keep going to Disneyland?,my one year passport expired and i cannot tell you how much i hate disneyland after this experience so many people no matter what day you go food is very expensive and no new rides in years they are putting all their money into star wars for next summer they even pulled out the professional photographers out of the princess areas yet i paid extra for that feature on my pass for my autistic son they stopped about months ago providing that service so i am done with disney not that they care ,3,2018-05-04
2784,Plan Your Trip In Advance and You'll Be Set,we planned our trip to visit both parks monday thursday with park hopper tickets if you search online for the slowest weeks at disneyland and can plan to go at that time i highly recommend that we went during one of the slowest times of the year and it benefited us we arrived about minutes before the parks opened to get through security and wait to get in the gates also get the app it will tell you wait times for rides what characters are going to be out when they will be out and where they will be located rise closures picture the list goes on between the hours of am pm at california adventure and am am at disneyland or am am if you have the magic hour available to you we were able to walk on most of the rides the exception to that was peter pan be prepared to wait at least minutes no matter what time of day you come and samtar tours all the other rides you walked on or you waited a minimal amount of time during the first hours of the park being opened plan to get fast passes they will help and save you a lot of time once the park starts filling up if you are planning on seeing the pixar parade get there about an hour early to save yourselves front row seats we got there minutes early and were able to find a random front row spot it starts right by small world my kids are and years old and they loved the parade it is really well done multiple days at the parks helped us maximize our stay and be able to take our time as much as possible if you are into seeing the characters make sure you are early to the meet and greet spots the lines can get long quickly and even if you are in line you might not be able to meet the character rapunzel and elena are super quick meet and greets and their lines are long before they even come out geston pardon my spelling from beauty and beast was hilarious he refuses to give autographs but loves to take pictures he will stop and talk to your kids and you for quite some time if you compliment him and butter him up my kids loved him we had a wonderful time and always do like i put in my title if you plan ahead you will do great you just can t expect to do everything in day there is just so much to do ,5,2018-05-04
2785,Happy to be leaving the Happiest Place on Earth,we visit disneyland every mos yrs have for over years this review is from april st april th employees of disneyland should be sent through disney s customer service training pros park was clean staff was quick to deal with accidents vomit and majority of the people we encountered were polite not over the top giddy with disney magic as in many trips before but nice enough to not be criticized i will give a shout out to a delightful hostess at carnation cafe even though she was older she was the poster child of disney s customer service philosophy she was a highlight of our trip wish we encountered more of her kind feedback it became evident this trip that you can enjoy the park if you re willing to throw money at it the max pass purchase was invaluable for efficiency so much so that you could possible do the parks in days and skip purchasing that third day pass if a quick trip and riding rides is what you re about if you didn t have the max pass you spent most of your time in lines as for ticket pricing i don t think we get what we pay for not anymore i can overlook closed rides rude staff and mediocre experience when it s only a few bucks but when i m saving for a magical vacation that is exactly what i m expecting the popular rides better be in proper working order i don t mind jungle cruise or it s a small world being down but indiana jones and thunder mountain just to name a couple should be running if something big is not running there should be a discount admission or coupon off food or merchandise a kick back of some sort water and popcorn or churro they need to compensate something somewhere i felt bad for some guests who didn t know that pirates of the caribbean was closing for pc updates which is completely ridiculous ride operators were great photographers the past years photographers have been hunting people down for photo ops take this card and get your photos before you leave my mother has spent hundreds of dollars buying the disc and digital downloads this trip i saw easily over a day period over photographers just standing around no one no one approached us a photo op we left both parks without taking one single family photo with a disneyland photographer i don t know why i don t know what happened i didn t approach any of them because they gave this vibe like please don t bother me maybe they were close to being off shift not making a commission or something like i don t know what they make or how they are paid all i know is not a single photographer was busy taking pictures odd cons as a guest of disneyland grand hotel we had early access to the park unfortunately disneyland was running some silly popcorn promo with the martian from toy story and they were letting folks into the park early people were running running then creating these long lines that caused congestion and chaos the same early morning we headed to tomorrowland a max pass fast pass for space mountain while the family rode i stayed back with my year old we had plans to hang out in the star wars landing facility however a very not so nice man was standing at the entrance as we smiled and started to walk past him he grunts it opens at am ewe really good morning to you too so i decide to get my son a little snack while we re waiting of course we re not going to get popcorn because there s about people in line and it s am i start to approach one of their fruit stands i call them fruit stands stand alone set up with bananas pickles juices water etc shoved in bins of ice as i reach for a banana a woman barks we re not open i was taken aback and i said when do you open and she ignored me had her back to me stocking water i stepped closer to her and said it again when do you open and she says without turning around about i was able to find him something at the star wars food court which was a poop show of people untrained staff and disarray of which windows were open and which ones weren t as we headed back to meet up with the others i noticed the fruit stand was now open for business maybe a lapse of minutes i m not sure what annoyed me more the park offering an early admittance to a park that isn t really open or the nasty and rude staff working the early morning shift no reason for their behavior at all disneyland should cut them lose and invest in stands that say closed opens at am and eliminate the nasty s who just piss on the magic of disneyland and is it unreasonable to reach for a water and a banana at am that should have been open for business at am that s just bad business and business practices it set a tone for the day and we were happy it was our last day there happy to be leaving the happiest place on earth it seemed we encountered a lot of unfriendly staff during our trip but this particular morning was filled with the rudest of them all i remember a time when cast members and characters were everywhere smiling warm engaged and friendly and making sure you were having a magical time those days are gone we saw hardly any characters never saw mickey or minnie the characters now stand in designated places with handlers lines of kids waiting for a picture they characters seem to take a break every minutes it was just disappointing when i was little and i don t mean to spoil anything for anyone but mickey was usually at or places in the park at any given time yes there was more than one mickey so even though the park holds some great memories of my youth and past trips it s not really generating new ones for me i really wish they would focus more on training and updating their personnel and hospitality as oppose to a new land or parade i m an experience person and a professional in customer service no roller coaster or firework show is going to be worth the ticket price over a poor customer service encounter and disappointing experience disneyland use to be magical the rides personnel characters story animation detail of the lands buildings furnishings landscape etc everything about walking through the gates was pure happiness it felt happy but now it s becoming just an overpriced amusement park from what i ve read universal studios is where it s at where you get your money s worth i ve never been but think it may be time to try it give my son a magical place even if it s not my magical place ,2,2018-05-04
2786,Always a fun place to go,disneyland is great my only complaint is the pixar show at night you are asked to stand it s a nice show but when your feet are tired all you want to do is sit and watch a show ,4,2018-05-04
2787,My kids loved it,finally got to take the family to disneyland after years of talking it up to them as i went over years ago must say i personally was disappointed with the ridiculously long lines and rude staff this is disneyland for petes sake and couldn t believe some of the comments by some we were minutes after o clock and were told that we couldn t get our photos because it was the next day so now we don t have any photos of the day disgusting in my opinion but that s life wont be back but at least the kids loved it ,4,2018-05-04
2788,Magical,tips for disneyland arrive before the gates open lines move fast and it gets you straight to a ride and a fastpass download the app and get a maxpass for the day it s definitely worth it for both fastpass access and professional photos plus the app gives you ride wait times and parade character appearance times take snacks and water in with you to avoid the high food prices you can have a backpack school bag size and take it on all the rides it is checked at the entrance to ensure no glass weapons selfie sticks etc comfy shoes we walked steps today around disney and california adventure powerbank and charging cable autograph book to keep the characters signatures a plastic bag to keep your valuables dry on the rides where you get wet we took a plastic bag that was big enough to cover our entire back pack sunscreen and hat there s a lot of sun walking between the different t lands jersey longs to keep warm when the sun goes down a great fireworks parade view point is up the top of the stairs where the train station is you can see down main street to the castle and the parade goes by it also means a quick escape from the crowd with so many hotels to choose from select one that is walking distance to the park and downtown disney as two adults we got round both parks fine we moved quickly and didn t really break much just snacked on the go we utilised the fast pass system and made it to most rides without actually having to join a normal cue the fast passes run out quick for popular rides so try get the big rides on a fast pass first take note of when you can make a new fast pass selection and keep and eye on the time you can have two fast passes if you time it right ,5,2018-05-04
2789,Still magical,as they continue to improve and i date rides there seems to always be something new parades and fireworks keep everyone entertained to closing ,5,2018-05-03
2790,It seems as if Disney has changed management.,i have visited disneyland at least once a year for each of the last ten years my four day trip that concluded five days ago was the first time i left disappointed it just wasn t as much fun and the hospitality was just off from wrong food orders at in park eateries on two separate occasions to poor crowd management to the several rides being temporarily closed it just wasn t a very pleasant experience this time around normally the high priced tickets are easier to accept because they usually give a five star experience to you and your children the cast members that were there the week of april rd just didn t seem with it they mostly seemed indifferent to the experience we were having and that attitude had not been the case on my previous dozen or so visits it was supposedly pixar fest aside from a couple posters and a change to the evening fireworks display there was no way i could tell i don t know if it was because significant portions of the park were under construction especially california adventure or if they were not expecting crowds that big for the post spring break pre summer period or if there is someone new in charge that is not properly motivating the employees i just don t know what i do know is that for the first time i am questioning if the amount of money i spent on this trip was worth it especially when you factor in the fact i stayed at the disneyland hotel it is disappointing to think i could have spent a week in hawaii for the same price and had a better experience i hope whatever is going on is temporary it will be truly sad if the park goes the way of most of corporate america a quick money grab that forgets the customers are the reason it makes any money in the first place ,2,2018-05-03
2791,I'm a convert,being british and a gnarly old cynic i wasn t too sure about having days with disney especially after the mega disappointing universal studios visit however it s fantastic you can see that rather than hoovering up the money it s spent on keeping you entertained throughout the day and the place clean and tidy the parades especially at night are incredible we were lucky enough to be there during the pixar fest and you cannot take it all in in one go do stay for the fireworks and make use of the fastpass if rides are your thing also the park hopper option makes sense especially if you are there for more than a day food is good and varied not especially cheap but comparable to restaurant prices go off peak if possible even in april it was busy and hot ,5,2018-05-03
2792,"Hey, it's DISNEYLAND!",i m not suprised that disneyland is just as fun solo as it is with larger groups i have a friend who goes every other day by himself so i thought why the heck not glad i did it s fun to just wander around with no specific agenda or demands from group family members as to where to go and what to do staff are wonderful as always and very kind to single riders no one batted an eye ,5,2018-05-02
2793,the happiest place on earth,literally my daughter mos was afraid of life size minnie and mickey but somehow the disney magic happened during our stay at dl and she ran up to them to hug them and pose for photos we enjoyed our time here and hope to return soon ,5,2018-05-02
2794,Overcrowded and disappointing,we were so excited to visit the original disneyland but couldn t have been more disappointed the overcrowding was unbelievable for an off peak thursday i can t even begin to imagine a peak day we managed to get on rides the whole day the queuing was out of control going round the sides of rides before you d even get in the actual ride queue so people would be pushing in and confused as to what they were even in line for kids seemed bored with waiting around so many smaller children running about seemingly by themselves and in huge crowds this was shocking and worrying and the amount of oversized strollers wasn t good running over toes banging into people it was like herding cattle getting out of the park at closing time nobody seemed in a good mood after their visit just stressed that isn t magic the rides we wen t on were ok but we expected character greetings after visiting universal studios only days before the contrast was so extreme there everyone was so so friendly and would take time out for pictures but the characters here would run away from all of that they seemed on a hugely tight schedule i saw so many kids unable to have pictures we managed to get one picture with goofy but the rushing staff member accompanying had her finger over the lens so that was a waste could use their time more wisely if it is so short if you are choosing between universal or disney to visit i cannot recommend universal enough but disney just killed the magic it seems to be about the money rather than truly caring about the guests having the best experience huge disappointment ,2,2018-05-02
2795,Can’t beat Disney,cant beat disney no matter what age always super organised and staff super helpful and polite the fast pass max for a ticket is a must enabling you to fast pass any ride on your phone from anywhere in the park ,5,2018-05-02
2796,Is Disneyland under new management?,visited disneyland with family and was surprised at the lack of hospitality and the mediocre customer service noticeably different from the type of service we had been accustomed to from our previous visits made me wonder if there was labor issues not that we didn t encounter some staff with that graciousness that had set disney parks apart from the rest but overall there seems a lack of enthusiasm it s been three years since i was here last might have to give disney world a try to see if they have changed as well hoping disney isn t abandoning their model of providing wonderful service to customers who come there to experience the happiest place on earth ,3,2018-05-02

2798,Wonderful time as always,when people say it s crowded what do they expect it is what it is my daughter and i go during times when it s not so busy lucky us we have pictures in frontierland empty so cool fast passes are the way to go even though we don t buy maxpass and use the paper ones we did get photos in cars land by an employee that we got printed there that were so cute most stroller people are crazy and will for sure run you over a few polite people don t though we love it so much it s expensive and whatnot but you know that going in and just realize it and have fun bring in water and snack to try and offset the cost ,5,2018-05-01
2799,Lots of walking and waiting if you don't have a fastpass!,we went at the end of april and a lot of stuff was not running no pirates of the caribbean ride while we were there depending on when you go the dixie steamboat ride is on during the week and the columbia sailing ship is on the weekend tomorrowland is slowing becoming a star wars and buzz lightyear exhibits we loved all of the other rides and enjoyed the eateries and restaurants expect to pay for sandwiches and for cookies of course you have to buy souvenirs but they are expensive the original mickey mouse cap with ears is and more if you want your name embroidered on it the mickey mouse headbands are more at and up there are parades throughout the day and night group singers in costume and school choirs performing too lots of places to get a picture with disney and other cast characters just expect lines to form for pictures with them we loved taking the disneyland railroad to get an overview of the park and you can get on and off at will at each station sad to say but you really need a fastpass to avoid spending time waiting for some of the more popular rides which can be over two hours long plus make sure you plan on where to use your fast pass as they limit out after pm parking was great once we found it and the trams are easy to use i was surprised by all the people taking baby strollers and electric scooters inside the park but there are plenty of areas to park them just remember to add some ribbon to remember what yours looks like to get it later not unusual to have strollers parked in one area i am pretty sure you can t do everything in one day hence the multiday park hoppers passes you will need to download the disney park app to keep track of everything that is going on that day ,4,2018-05-01
2800,MUST DO!!,although it can get pretty expensive you can t come all the way to california and not experience the magic of disney go early in the morning and get the disney app you pay dollars but it s worth every penny you can get your fast passes this way and it allows you to have your picture taken by professional photographers in the park stay for the fireworks they are spectacular ,5,2018-05-01
2801,Waiting for the Tram,so it said mins mins have past and still no tram hold on it s coming again wasting my time in the line ,1,2018-05-01
2802,What's that noise?,took a year old and year old had a wonderful time definitely the most fun i have had year old went on every ride he was able storm troopers made his visit met lord vader and kylo ren in star wars lauchpad did the visit at their pace and it was fantastic every time the year old heard a sound what s zat noise we began to laugh after a couple of days of the question then he started to do it just for the reaction we will need to visit again when he will have more retention of the park would do it again to see the wide eyes and awe from a child s view,5,2018-05-01
2803,Always fun...,spent two days at the resort as a get away with my wife we did really well on getting on rides quickly by using the fast pass system a couple of rides were down for maintenance but that is to be expected the construction on the new star wars section is progressing well and i am looking forward to that new land ,4,2018-05-01
2804,My Disneyland Visit,though i still like to visit disneyland the new rules make it less fun you cannot be spontaneous with your visit if you do not want to stand in long lines you must constantly check the apps for fast pass times and lines a real pain in the neck if you do not do this forget about getting on any of the good rides plus they charge and extra per person to do this on the app they apparently didn t charge me enough for my tickets on monday april th it took us minutes to get through the bag check lines it was am when we arrived then it took another minutes to get through the ticket lines ridiculous food is very expensive for a family bring as much as you can from the outside to save some money we used to visit at least once every year no more it will be several years before i go back too bad i think the disney people have gotten too greedy poor walt must be turning over in his grave i don t think this new disney experience is what he had in mind there are many other places in the us where families can visit this is what this family will be doing in the future ,3,2018-05-01
2805,Wasn’t as magical as Walt Disney World,we go to walt disney world x a year we decided to give disneyland a try this year to cross it off our bucket list we found disneyland not as magical as walt disney world the cast members weren t as friendly and the park wasn t as clean it was lacking the atmosphere of walt disney world the more compact nature of disneyland led to a very congested feel while we re glad we visited once we aren t planning to return ,3,2018-04-30
2806,what else can be said !!,the happiest place on earth you have to be a kid at heart to really get into walt s house as a child of the s and s i was at the park when it first opened in i do remember stuff believe it or not i was going on it was still orange county with citrus trees even still in the parking lot went there as a kid teen and dad with kids to comeback with granddaughters was a blessing and a treat ,5,2018-04-30
2807,This is still an inspiring place for me!,in la for biz i always build a day into the work for fun i am an ap holder in orlando but somehow this is different you know walt walked here this is where it started i feel it and it s inspiring i really enjoyed the old artifacts i saw an illustrator working at a historic illustrators desk you just wonder what was drawn up at that desk so i had a great time on the original main street and who do i thank for the weather s and dry what a great day ,5,2018-04-30
2808,It’s an experience!!,this review is what i learned to do and not do where do i begin ok let s start with before before we went to the park i read blog after blog of how to conquer the park dont do that when we got there i was already on edge ready to run around like a chicken with my head cut off to get the most out of the park when we got there and i saw other adults running to open lines to get in and dragging their kids here and there parents crowding one another so their kid could experience things parents yelling at their kids because they spent all this money so they re gonna force their kids to go on rides even if the kid was crying and saying they were scared broke my heart i caught a glimpse of what i was going to look like and i stopped right there and changed my plan completely i realized disney is supposed to be about what your kids want to do it s not going anywhere and it s about your kids kids do make it about your kids so i turned to my and year old and asked them what they wanted to do after i did that it was such an amazing and relaxing time i told them we can come back if we don t hit everything it worked they were relaxed and so were my husband and me i taught my children and myself a life and parent lesson relax all they wanted to do was get autographs from characters and ride rides as we saw them so in all my prep i did download the app do that it s worth it do buy the max pass worth the ticket in the app you can use the max pass not every ride was on there and they do run out of passes for rides so if you really want to ride a ride i d get it out of the way no rides in fantasyland have fast passes or max pass from what i saw there were some in toon town doing fast or max pass is worth it the app also holds your tickets jic you lose your paper tickets it also has a park map and all of the characters where they are when what time how long how long ride waits are restrooms photopass which is def worth it to it comes with maxpass it lets you save your photos to your phone make sure you scan your code before or after your photos are taken by the photographers the app also lets you reserve and see the times to eat in the local restaurants ok so we went on monday and it was still relatively crowded preferred parking worth it we were so close to the escalator after hours in the park it was wonderful seeing our car right there at the top of the stairs do bring your own food and water or snacks i would say we easily spent just on food and drinks alone so next time we go i m bringing our food also nothing has refills plus it s healthier and i don t think there isn t anything that s less than oh i m sorry a little thing of popcorn was ybmy kids eat like teenage boys and my husband does too lol so it ll save us a pretty penny next time plus i thought it ridiculous that lunch at one of the restaurants in there for a party of was almost all we had was chicken salad burger combo and kids meals i felt gypped when i saw all the vets with their carts and lunches packed none of the blogs said that lol we did do the character dining but that s a different review they have souvenirs you can buy but i saved those things until we were about to leave the park because i don t want to carry it around all day you can find pretty much everything in the disney store in downtown disney at least for your kids for you maybe rides had long lines and wait time so be prepared for that try and use the fast pass if you can we tried to do one land at a time so we weren t running all over the park with that said in the hours spent there we only hit fantasyland adventureland tomorrowland new orleans square and critter country we rode the train at the very end and most people left after the fireworks so we hit a ride after that indiana jone since it was so close to the exit overall relax and have a great time we did i highly recommend doing multiple trips so you can really enjoy each land we will be returning more prepared and look forward to see the things we didn t get to ,4,2018-04-30
2809,amazing,disney s magic almost at its best it s disney so the moment you step foot in the gate the excitement is on the built is amazing and truly magical rides are pretty awesome if it s our childhood signature small world ride or any of the new ones shows are on adding a great value to the visit the amount of people they let in is pretty crazy and you feel like you just wait in line more than anything else ride lines go up to and minutes but moreover to get some unhealthy pricey food you ll have to wait in line for about minutes and even toilet lines are unbearable and that s on a regular weekday in april can t imagine the wait during holidays and summer vacation,5,2018-04-30
2810,Happiest place on earth,i ve been to disneyland for a total of times in my life now first time was as a college student second time with my boyfriend now my hubby and third time with my twin toddlers and hubby every visit has been fun young or old it truly is a magical place take lots of snacks and bubbles for the little ones to keep them occupied while waiting in line use the disneyland app to track ride times and character appearances have fun ,5,2018-04-30
2811,Best Amusement Park in Southern California,disneyland has been my favorite amusement park since i first went there in i have been an annual passholder for over years and still enjoy all of its attractions the most enchanting times are during the winter when the attractions are beautifully decorated with holiday cheer it is very difficult to ride all of the attractions in one day but some of the more popular rides for adults include space mountain star tours the matterhorn indiana jones ride big thunder the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean for the younger set all of the attractions in toontown autopia buzz lightyear dunbo ride astro orbiter it s a small world mad hatter cups and the large carousel if you want to maximize your time buy a maxpass for requires a smartphone and official disneyland app when you enter the park you can reserve a fastpass to rides at either park without waiting in line at the kiosks beware not to select a fastpass to a ride too far in advance because you cannot make another selection until your time of that fastpass ,5,2018-04-29
2812,It was like stepping back 45 years in time!,although i ve been to disney world more recently i hadn t been to disneyland in about years i have to say not much has changed if my memory serves me correctly of course there are some updates but the overall disney experience was very similar to back in the s i like that nostalgic feeling although there is still that magic i sadly have to say that i didn t think the appearance and upkeep were quite what i expected we went during a very busy time and i was expecting it to be busier that was a pleasant surprise yes it was busy and lines were long but i ve waited in longer lines granted this time we didn t feel the pressure to have to see and ride everything maybe that was the difference our trip was planned as part of the disney arts program my grandson went to perform with his high school orchestra so many family members went to see them i think it s wonderful that disney offers this once in a lifetime opportunity i only wish the stage was a little more out in the open so more people would have been able to see their performance the food was pretty good i especially enjoyed the mickey beignets they were yummy and in addition to the regular ones they had a special flavor too yum probably the worst part was waiting for the bus at the end of the night i think our bus driver took a break just as we got to the stop the other routes had multiple buses coming and going while we waited and waited for an hour yes you read that right this visit sure brought back memories of my childhood ,4,2018-04-29
2813,No longer any quiet days here,i will break this review done into a tip and then some suggestions for disneyland management tip don t believe any of the websites that show which days are quiet or not we went on a tuesday and wednesday in non la school holiday period all sites said it would be a ghost town at disney on these days this was so far from the truth it was disappointing after speaking to a number of locals there are no longer any more days where disneyland is a ghost town so if you re planning a trip here be prepared for very long queues no matter what day you go it is a very expensive way to spend days but disney know this and are quite happy to take your money while packing the punters into the park go with an open mind about he crowds and you might just be sane enough to get through it and be wise with your use of fast passes ie use the disney app suggestions to disney management with regards to snack food it would be nice if disney made some sort of effort to open some outlets that provided healthier snack alternatives i think if disney wants to be a good corporate citizen they should look into this autopia ride i think it s great that disney have updated the body of the cars but i think it s about time that they think of ditching the gas guzzling cars that send fumes into the mouths of those queueing to use this ride and think about changing these cars to electric or use some sort of magnet technology they have the money and they have the know how to do this but i can t understand why it hasn t been done yet i hope disney really consider this ,3,2018-04-29
2814,As good as ever!,another incredible trip to disneyland even as we and our children get older the magic does not ever end the park is impeccable and the staff is kind and welcoming the new fast pass max is a huge time saver and makes your wait times incredibly reasonable an absolute must do ,5,2018-04-29
2815,The Happiest Place on Earth - Verified,this was my families first time to visit the original disneyland park and we were not disappointed the kid in me with my kids were very ecstatic and excited upon entering the gates to disneyland rides galore pictures with disney characters and presentations were abound throughout the one day we were here tips for first timers certain restaurants allow visitors to refill their respective water bottles visitors can bring certain foods to minimize your expenses inside the park plan your rides and fastpass preferences in advance lines can become crazy long and they are not the best places to stay with cranky toddlers download and use the disneyland app it is a lifesaver and essential partner during your trip,5,2018-04-29
2816,Disneyland Park,the line waiting time is much nicer than yrs ago with their fastpass maxpass system in place that dramatically reduces your wait time standing in line at least that was our experience this past week in april however april is a better time to visit d l as it is a tad bit slower time of the year for them it s nice of d l to allow visitors to bring in your own food water if you wish to have your own meals or perhaps even for those people who have special dietary needs but whatever the case is you will save a ton of from buying food at the rather expensive restaurants in the park disney california adventure are always a fun place to spend with family friends etc lots of hotels nearby with plenty of restaurants public transportation certainly makes visiting southern california a great place to visit ,4,2018-04-29
2817,Hour Disney,it was extra busy this year we come the same time every year we love disney i will say this year the employees are not as friendly or alert of the really excited kids it is a little disappointed you can tell it has come all about the money,3,2018-04-29
2818,Amazing Disney experience!!,we had such a amazing time here the disney fireworks show was spectacular i recommend finding a spot right in front the castle to get the whole show in we had to wait hours prior to the fireworks in order to have a good spot it was so worth it my son was in awe i loved the finding nemo submarine ride the gumbo bread bowls is very delicious and a must try on your list ,5,2018-04-29
2819,Great family fun!,we all loved this park great rides and the true disney atmosphere big thunder mountain was our favourite but the whole park is a fantastic family day out ,5,2018-04-29
2820,Good Day in the Park,i am not a great disney fan but we had a whole day here and i must say it was fun the rides were not very busy max wait was mins highlights were the yellow submarine and the indiana jones ride the stone ball rolling towards you was very exciting as a scuba diver i was impressed with the submarine ride and the impression of diving down with the bubbles and lighting etc we had a simple cesar salad for lunch which was good value with loads of chicken and very tasty we enjoyed the parade which was very professional a few rides were variously not working but the last one stopped after we waited mins in the evening chill so we decided to skip the fireworks and get back to the warmth of our hotel via the shuttle bus good day in the park,4,2018-04-29
2821,First time visit,the disney experience was fabulous the rides the shows esp the pixar parade frozen performance everything was awesome my almost thirteen year olds and both my husband and i enjoyed it space mountain tomorrow land was a must california adventure was fabulous the whole trip was enjoyable ,5,2018-04-29
2822,Whole day entertainment,recommend to really dedicate some significant amount of time for this visit otherwise you might end up being disappointed that you weren t able to try all attractions,5,2018-04-29
2823,It's Disney,writing as an east coaster visiting for the first time pros disney matterhorn indiana jones better space mountain affordable maxpass option makes for a better fastpass experience and love that photos are included cons pirates closed just before our arrival crowds even on a ghost town level day make the tiny park feel too full and lines are long many have no fastpass option people camp for fireworks hours before so those of us with limited time trying to enjoy the park rides don t stand a chance of seeing them ,4,2018-04-28
2824,1st Timer,i celebrated my th birthday with my st visit to disneyland for theand it definitely lived up to all of the hype the park is beautiful super clean with tons of activities food and shopping options for all ages the staff was friendly and helpful as well due to a health condition i cannot get on most rides so i cannot comment on the wait times however i had a good time meeting some of the characters and enjoying the parade and other shows new orleans square was one of my favorite areas of the park as far as the crowds and food lines they were not as bad as one would expect but there were tons of strollers everywhere i would suggest visiting the park during the weekdays in the early afternoon to avoid long security and check in lines overall it was definitely worth a visit the next trip will be even better ,5,2018-04-28
2825,disneyland is totally out of control,wayyyyyyyy too many people strollers we couldnt even go back into the parking garage because everywhere around the parking and that ridiculous u turn to get there was sooo backed up we ended up going back to the hotel and hopping on the shuttle,2,2018-04-28
2826,Visit Tuesday -Thursday,what s not to love about disneyland a few hints go on the weekdays for less people download the disney app and use the information as for times of special events and do the max pass well worth the a day do it on your phone it s much easier than having to find a max pass booth plan a head and make a couple of food reservations you can always cancel but good luck trying to get into one if there very good restaurants without a reservation make reservations a head for downtown disney also ,4,2018-04-28
2827,Great but huge queues on sunny day,firstly the security to get to the park was an hour wait with no shade from the blazing sun one woman fainted in the queue although disney staff were quick to assist her it s great to be safe but i would suggest a change in the way people are lined up as many rude people were pushing in disneyland itself is magical and the opening hours are very generous the queues for indiana jones and the haunted mansion were huge there were a lot of places you weren t allowed to sit or stand during the parades due to the lack of space on a busy day as far as i could see the benches were reserved for large people and their families seems harsh to be punished for being fit and healthy the pixar fest parade was decent although i do prefer seeing the classic disney characters the pirates of the caribbean ride was amazing i loved it the staff in general were very friendly although one or two of the staff were a bit blunt and not as friendly families with young children will love disney although i saw very few of the characters around the park i assume they were in hiding due to it being so busy i probably wouldn t visit this park again as this was my rd visit but i am keen on trying disney world in florida ,4,2018-04-28
2828,Excellent but food too expensive,first of all i am a huge disney fan so top marks for the park etc a must go obviously food too expensive though i paid dollars for a small finger bun and a cheap tinned sausage i expect actual cost was around dollars max tip take your own picnic or disney lower your prices or raise our expectations ,5,2018-04-28
2829,Lots of Fun!,disneyland is awesome but its not the impeccable service and cleanliness i remember from the past we had several instances where the wait staff was very rude in a few restaurants river belle terrace to be exact and we had an almost bad experience at the hungry bear restaurant i ordered poweraide for my grandson who is a diabetic and was told by different people that it was poweraide zero when in fact it wasn t we finally got a truthful answer that it was not and avoided what could have been a very dangerous situation with him ,4,2018-04-28
2830,Park was great crowds not so much,we went on a wednesday we chose not to to use the fast pass you can add to your ticket for a fee we got on pretty much every ride using the old fast pass system we got our passes and went on smaller rides in between times we have been to disneyland every year for years but for the past years it seems to have lost some of the magic for us don t get me wrong the staff was friendly characters on point and not a hint of trash to be seen it is the crowds that take from the fun i get it disneyland is a popular place and i knew that it would be crowded but s it s the rude people pushing by you while running to get to that ride or that toy story popcorn limited addition whatever we stopped to tie my sons shoe near main street and some lady with her kids freaked out thinking we were trying to get in her spot for the parade gasp things like that take from the magic leaving the park during closing was a friggin nightmare i was honestly worried i was going to loose my kids in the crowd even having them all hold hands with me in front people still managed to push in between my and year old forcing them to let go of each other i hate to say this but we will not be returning next year not because of the park or staff but due to the crowds thank you disney for the past years of great memories ,4,2018-04-28
2831,Happy Place,this was my second trip to the states but my first time to disneyland and i became a kid again dreams made loved it ,5,2018-04-27
2832,Overcrowded, in the morning we got sent to overflow parking bad sign two mile walk to park through downtown disney no tram minutes still not in park wait minutes in line to get in and all ride have minutes wait times too many people to even walk down the street just way to crowded for a thursday in late april i cant even imagine what it is like when it is full we will not be coming back just not worth the cost and the crowds ,1,2018-04-27
2833,So over rated,just spent days here basically you are spending thousands of dollars to wait in a line to park to wait in another line to get on a tram to wait in a line to get in the park to wait in line all day for anything all this fun is split up with lots of very overpriced merchandise and mediocre food there are a few good things like watching your kids faces when they get to meet a favorite character or when you actually make it on a ride then when its all done you get to wait in all those same lines again to leave and dont forget there will be thousand people pushing and shoving the whole time do it once if your not a local way better ways to spend a couple grand in my opinion,2,2018-04-27
2834,Happiest place on earth!,we went there for my daughter s rd birthday it was awesome you might wanna ride the train going inside because it s really a long walk there s a bit construction so no parade for us but the experience was funtastic check the fastpass schedule for convenience and download the disneyland app ,5,2018-04-27
2835,A childhood dream come true!!,i am sure it is every childs dream to visit disneyland and at years of age i have finally done it we had a day pass and we made the most of everyday most days we were there at opening and leaving at closing such very special memories made to last a lifetime ,5,2018-04-27
2836,Best time ever!,what else can you say its disneyland we had the best time and cannot wait to return for the new star wars land ,5,2018-04-26
2837,Back at the Right Time - this time!,my daughter and i wanted to have some fun girl time together we walked and laughed throughout the park for days we finally figured out a less crowded time to go which made it even better this time it ll always be our favorite escape from the world ,5,2018-04-26
2838,ATTACK OF THE OVERSIZED STROLLERS ! BEWARE...,an inordinate amount of huge strollers everywhere impeding the flow of walking clogging up streets in the park it really is too much of course throw in lack of parenting ignorantly dragging newborns to a germy public park mothers using double wide strollers for yr olds and bag storage and were done visiting the magic kingdom a sad commentary on society ,3,2018-04-26
2839,Quick get away,i love this place i try to collect the pins they give out at the park try to go between january thru may less crowded you get to get on a lot of rides on the first few hours ,5,2018-04-26
2840,Awesome Park,we loved our time at disneyland the original park that started it all we went on a monday and it was still crowded make sure you are aware of magic hours when planning your trip ,5,2018-04-25
2841,Too crowded and no playing quality,i d say the ride and the art design in disneyland park are good i can see the park spending much effort on maintaining a good park however the park is too crowded there is no playing quality here i strongly suggest disneyland should control the number of people entering the park or just double the admission fee at some dates to control the experience of visiting this theme park so in the end i don t think it is worth the money ,3,2018-04-25
2842,Great time,our kids were only which was a bit young for a lot of the rides but they still had a great time meeting all the characters october was not a good time of the year to go with halloween parties it was extremely busy the character breakfast was good but the food average compared to the other food venues in the park highly recommend a few days with small children so you can do it at a more relaxed pace and not rush to see everything looking forward to taking the kids back in a few years ,5,2018-04-25
2843,Better than Disneyworld! Tips included!,we have been to disneyworld numerous times and this was our first time to disneyland and it did not disappoint maybe it was because it didn t take us minutes to get to the front gate or that it was not degrees in the florida sun but we will take this park over florida any day there was just more to do at disneyland like the indiana jones ride or the alice in wonderland nemo star wars etc but we had a blast i highly suggest getting there early like minutes prior to park opening to get through security and through the front gate and book it to high wait time rides like space mountain star tours indiana jones all fast pass eligible peter pan s flight no fast passes on peter pan and who can forget about the family favorites small world and the mad tea party be sure to see the fantasmic show it is spectacular the photopass is a good option if you just want to relax and let someone else take the photos and also so you dad can be in the photos too it averaged us cents a photo after the photopass that was worth it for a professional photographer and not carrying around a large camera and all you have to do in the end is download them at home and i m in the photos dining experiences are more limited at disneyland than disneyworld we did not do any character dining here like at dw bring food drinks if you want to avoid the high prices you can bring just about any food or beverage no glass alcohol into the park and also no coolers we ate at the french market restaurant hungry bear restaurant and numerous quick service places do not be afraid to ask for rider exchange at the entrance to the attraction we had a baby with us and asked at every ride for it and were usually granted it or told we could bring the baby with us this allows one parent a chance to experience the attraction with your older children and then allows the other parent to go on the same attraction again with your children while the other watches the baby this allows both parents the chance to experience the attraction while avoiding waiting in line twice ,5,2018-04-24
2844,Much the same as Paris,i absolutely love disneyparks including this one however it is very much like the paris parks and is very very busy even when it s not the school holidays a lot of rides were closed but overall it was so much fun and loved the shows and rides just a pity the cancelled the fireworks and told you last minute,3,2018-04-24
2845,One of our favorite vacations,we always love going to disneyland it can be crazy crowded sometimes though i think the employees are not as cheerful as they used to be but disneyland will always be a favorite ,4,2018-04-23
2846,Has gone down a little,one of the things i loved about disneyland was the attention to detail and being updated often some details have gone downhill lately little things maybe most wouldn t notice lighting out in some of the rides some things had been rubbed to the point of deterioration dirt on things etc walt was a perfectionist and wouldn t open a ride if it wasn t the employees have lost that luster and smile attitude too ,4,2018-04-23
2847,Still the happiest place on earth even with the heightened security,it was a bit taxing to get into the park and the outer security staff are not all as warm as those in the park but once you are in the experience is amazing the staff really work hard to make your experience magical ,5,2018-04-23
2848,First trip to the land of dreams,one if my favorite places to visit besides the security and entry to park lines my only problem was maneuvering all the strollers i think there should be a curfew for strollers like pm so people dont have to worry about tripping over them in the dark ,5,2018-04-23
2849,Little disappointed,when we booked disneyland we were told it would not be busy well we found out the hard way it was waiting an hour in line for rides they had people jumping into the fastpass lanes and not pulling them up staff were rude and looked like they were having fun i dont think i would go back ,2,2018-04-23
2850,Gets better the older you get,i was lucky enough to be celebrating my th birthday at disneyland last halloween in magical and happy are words that don t even come close the attention to detail with the halloween decorations the light parade and the epic fireworks display down to the birthday badges the trick or treat stops across the park late at night or just downright fun with the rides and the disney characters i haven t been so spoilt for choice and i have never smiled so much i haven t for a long time felt the stress of life lift off my shoulders like i did that day hugged by so many loved by so many others ,5,2018-04-23
2851,Magical !!!!,disneyland is truly the most magical place on earth yes it s not great when you have to line up all day for rides or when it takes an hour to just get in the park but it s disneyland you have to go there expecting a big crowd my year old girls loved it the did the bibbity boppity boutique experience which was a little expensive but worth it the disneyland app is really helpful with a park map and wait times for each ride we used it all the time and targeted the rides with just min wait time we had a day park hopper pass and that was plenty the kids actually got a little tired of it all by day so i think day pass would be perfect when traveling with smaller kids ideally if you stay close to the park you can plan a morning session and then a night session to maximize your time we stayed at the hyatt house which was probably just a bit too far for the kids to walk up and back twice a day so just plan your day in advance in terms of what to see and do and use the disneyland app but be prepared for the big crowds and wait time for rides otherwise you will be disappointed ,5,2018-04-22
2852,Magical,had a magical time here on a day park hopper pass look in the maxpass as it allows a bit more options around booking fast passes for rides just note that you have to have entered the park to book your st fast pass and then for the rest of the day you can do it from anywhere on th he app only downside with fast pass is still that you cannot chose a specific time got a fast pass at am to return to a ride after pm that night luckily we staid close by so was not a issue but overall a good experience and worth the trip from australia ,4,2018-04-22
2853,magical,even as an adult couple you can have a great time favorite rides are big thunder small world and pirates,5,2018-04-22
2854,Great fun first time or 20th,great fun for first or th time it s especially important you get fast pass with your ticket and know the layout and what rides to prioritize walking because no matter how you cut it lots of walking highly recommend getting disneyland app and using it to see wait times show times etc surprising how a ride can have a wait time of min or more and suddenly after checks it s min for a while we took advantage a few times of that info,5,2018-04-22
2855,Disneyland: Still Amazing 30 Years Later,i love this place and taking my kids there years after my parents took me is the most beautiful experience space mountain is still my favorite ride so make sure you hit it up prices have gone up significantly but so has inflation night time disney is what we did and i highly recommend it if your kids can rally late night for food get the chirros too ,5,2018-04-22
2856,Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave...,my husband and i brought our year old son to disneyland for a family vacation we would do anything for him and at the end of the day s i think he enjoyed himself and that is really what matters that said what a nightmare this experience turned out to be happiest place on earth more like hell on earth i m not sure where to begin the night before we planned to go we tried to purchase tickets on the app but received error messages we ended up calling some customer service number and purchasing over the phone we were told to pick up the tickets at will call when we got to the park we somehow ended up in the line to actually enter the park even though we were directed to that line as the pick up ticket line when we realized this my husband jumped out of line to go find the actual ticket booth at this point we d already been waiting in line for quite a while i tried to find some shade for my son and i to wait in i guess we were in the way and an employee actually asked if she needed to call security when we finally got tickets we went to the back of the entrance line again ok whatever possibly our mistake for being clueless newbies even though we were directed to that line once we were about to enter the man who took our tickets also needed to take our picture i was not aware pictures were taken or for what purpose so i wasn t really prepared he practically barked at me to remove my sunglasses he followed this up by yelling at me that i was in the wrong line for the turnstile the stroller would fit through wow glad i was wearing my first time to disneyland pin speaking of strollers these were perhaps some of the crappiest strollers i ve ever seen with very limited room for storing any items small uncomfortable dirty this is disney i mean it s supposed to be family friendly in my humble opinion they can do better once we were in the park it really wasn t much better of a scene it was crazy crowded people were bumping into us and the stroller and i was fearful of hitting people with our stroller i think i finally understand packed in like sardines the waits for the preschool rides were minutes followed by like minutes of actual ride time which doesn t exactly scream kid friendly to me thank goodness i was prepared with distractions and ice water ironically we ran into a cast member later who told us it was a slow day and to imagine ten times more people and waits of hours ummmmmm where is the magic in that experience speaking of cast members i could not believe how unhappy so many of the employees looked if we spoke to a dozen employees over our two day visit i can think of two that were bubbly the rest apeared tired grumpy and uneager to assist i actually felt guilty for asking the few newbie questions i asked in addition to this i heard cast members grumbling about not being scheduled for break we encountered more employees you could tell from the name badges that we didn t interact with and so many just looked ridiculously unhappy by this point i couldn t wait to meet the characters who i was certain would bring the magic and this brings me to perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole experience for months we told our son about how he would get to meet the characters we really played it up i mean he s three so meeting the characters was bound to be the highlight of the trip for him over two days we saw belle from afar the evil queen from snow white from afar and pluto pluto shook my little guy s hand but was gone before we could get a picture or an autograph thank goodness i had booked a character breakfast for which we were seated minutes after our reserved time where we met mickey minnie daisy and stitch if i had not we would have only met pluto whoop dee do my little guy was so disappointed and kept asking where the characters were at one point i mentioned something to the guy trying to sell us a vacation club membership and he said there should be two characters right over there but when he went to point he was like oh they re not there now helpful he ended up giving us a sticker a for effort i knew that our trip would be expensive and that there would be crowds and lines but i honestly expected so much more for the ridiculous amount of money spent and to be honest from the name disney i guess we simply missed the magic that calls some people back for multiple visits before investing your money and time in a trip to disneyland do your research i didn t write this review only to rant i m not sure reading a review like this one would have deterred me from a visit because i visited for the kiddo not myself but after day two i left feeling only like i d completed a parenting rite of passage like i checked something off of a lifelong to do list i felt no magic no wonder no awe perhaps just some sadness mixed with disappointment ,2,2018-04-22
2857,Anaheim Holiday,very well organised and presented venue took a while to get through the gates but that must be expected all the rides give some indication as to the wait time for each ride i was disappointed with access to the characters however it appears you can only access them if you purchase a photo ticket but not certain of this sorry the only other constructive criticism i have for the happiest place on earth is the express pass on some rides appears to be a money grab they should line up like everyone else for mine a once in a lifetime experience which we have all enjoyed ,5,2018-04-21
2858,Vacation to Disneyland,our recent trip to disneyland was totaly awesome a wonderful change from disneyworld loved the fact it was within easy walking distance to the hotel disneyland stayed open until midnight every night and california adventure until pm diffinetly had plenty of time to do everything loved the fact that the fastpass was on paper tickets unless you pay for the maxpass and it was a first come basis so it was available to everyone at the same time and not just to resort guest days prior loved that all the rides are close together and not spread out like at disneyworld can get from one side of the park to the other in less than minutes also enjoyed the one day of early access that we got with our tickets it was spring break when we was out there but the crowds was not that bad most of the time our wait for a ride was minutes or less unless it was one of the main attractions like cars or space mountain i thought this would have been a one time trip just to see where it all started because disneyworld is much bigger and has more parks but we loved everything about disneyland and will definitely be going back real soon if you never have been you need to a least go one time it is totally worth it ,5,2018-04-21
2859,Believe in magic! They will make it happen!,we went with our yo and it was amazing the magic started the moment we came in and bumped into mickey mouse there s a great mix of sedate and exciting rides and everyone is there to make sure you have a good time we even had a janitor go out of her way to make our trip extra special a trip we will remember for ever just do it ,5,2018-04-21
2860,I've been converted to a true believer,i recently went to disneyland with my yo daughter and wife i have not been to disneyland for well a very very long time over the years i ve built up a sort of dislike for all things relating to d land the mm ears on the antennae the tinkerbell stickers the shirts etc and i was not overly excited to spend time there but then it happened i saw the genuine smiles on the workers there the giddy anticipation of children and adults walking to the entrance and i saw the excitement in my daughters face as she rode her first roller coaster it all sank in at that point disney s vision has been preserved and improved upon over the years and i could not look at any one place and not see a level of detail rarely found in today s world of course we spent a fair amount of money on food and chachkey and i strongly feel that honda should update autopia with electric or even fuel cell cars but all in all i had a great time and take back all the years of me rolling my eyes at the happiest place on earth ,4,2018-04-21
2861,How to make the best of your visit,you are lucky to take this trip disney has lots to offer and remember you are here to enjoy be happy and look around something is fun at every nook and corner i m not going to tell you about specific rides here but how to make the best of your day note every disney employee including eateries people is very helpful don t hesitate to ask anyone around if you need something it could be directions to the toilets or where you may buy some french fries if you have one day and you are staying outside disney in another hotel here is what you do step study the park rides and decide what rides you want all rides have lines naturally get there early as soon as the gates open get a fast pass for every ride you want a fast pass lets you come back at a certain time and access the ride without waiting too long you have enough time all day pace yourself no worry rest eat look around soak in all that disney has to offer do not miss the following the last part of the day pm is when two fabulous items are offered one is fantasmia show and the final fire works you better stake out a good viewing place for fantasmia show early fireworks are easy and visible from lot of places no issues there if you have two or more days just take it easy and plan well for both days so you could really see everything in detail enjoy at the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-04-20
2862,Disneyland is still amazing!,disneyland has some incredible rides and attractions such as pirates of the caribbean haunted mansion indiana jones adventure only at disneyland and not at disneyworld matterhorn bobsleds splash mountain space mountain star tours etc and the iconic nightly fireworks above cinderella s castle so much to do and the park is so easy to get around not as spread out as disney world s magic kingdom food is actually delicious too in several restaurants in disneyland and you have an abundant selection of fast food ,5,2018-04-20
2863,Truly the happiest place on Earth,nothing bets this place when seeing it through the eyes of a year old my granddaughter absolutely loved disneyland she didn t want her photo taken but instead wanted to enjoy everything i would suggest buying the day pass to see both parks we went home and had a rest in the afternoon going back late afternoon for the fireworks and found it so much easier at night getting on rides i didn t think the food was that overpriced if you want to have dinner i would recommend booking in advance the disney app is fantastic allowing you to check ride times our day pass purchase on expedia included fast pass we also purchased maxi pass for person at a cost of and this included any photographs taken i would also highly recommend bibbidi bobbidi boop although it is expensive at for a hair make up and a princess gown it s a once in a lifetime opportunity i would also recommend staying near by so you don t have to get the shuttle castle inn is where we stayed but there was also the desert inn across the road castle inn offered free parking and was only a night ,5,2018-04-20
2864,Nothing like it !!,what a great place it really is the happiest place on earth lots of laughing and smiles the fast pass and app are a great combination and i would budget at least one day to pay the extra pp we smashed out heaps of ride walking almost straight on to the rides ,5,2018-04-19
2865,Mickey and the Magical Map,i specifically want to review the production show of mickey and the magical map before the show my children and i were visiting with one of the staff i believe her name was susan anyway she was amazing she answered all our questions and made our day even better by putting us in the front row made us feel very special thanks from the montanan s ,5,2018-04-19
2866,Amazing as usual,love love love the land hate the world this is so much more manageable to me and my family to enjoy than disneyworld loved that they offered affordable preferred parking food choices were good missed the dumbo ride as it was under reno ,5,2018-04-19
2867,Best place ever!!!!!!!!,disneyland is dream land it is amazing more than amazing people are so friendly you should go to disneyland it is super only one problem everything is a bit expensive like a lot expensive but still disneyland rules ,5,2018-04-19
2868,Place of dreams,what a great day something for everyone kids were completely out of control with excitement splash mountain broke down while we were in the line so we waited it out and managed to get on only minutes after our original wait time anyway so wasn t too disappointed with that got absolutely soaked which my son loved and i enjoyed at the time although walking around the rest of the day with wet feet isn t great maybe some drainage holes somewhere attention to detail is second to none i have been to disneyland in paris and orlando and although this park appears to be the smallest it certainly packs a punch nonetheless the only negative thing i would have to say is on the communication side of things it s great that you have an app that gives you wait times and all the staff remind me of it but with no free wifi international travellers like myself have to pay an arm and a leg for international roaming data charges so what s the point both universal studios and legoland provide free wifi fyi also perhaps review the height range for the matterhorn my daughter was about cm above the minimum height and got banged around so badly she actually had a small lump on her head afterward and it will probably take a bit of therapy to ever get her to back on a roller coaster ,3,2018-04-19
2869,Choir trip,enjoyed the park as usual but this trip included the worldstrides heritage festival awards after the fireworks saturday and true to disney it was a show and entertaining love the park at night too if your child s school is going be a chaperone ,5,2018-04-18
2870,It’s Disneyland,had fun it s disneyland need i say more if you want to feel like a kid at a park i recommend this place ,5,2018-04-18
2871,Love this place,although disappointed by there not being any parades and dumbo was closed during our time there it was still a magical and amazing trip it was busy it was during spring break but we used the app to help us with wait times so we could make the best choice we used our early entry and that was a great start we purchased the maxpass for member of our party to have access to the photopass photographer photos for just and was money well spent we didn t use maxpass for the rides great rides beautiful themeing and just magical ,5,2018-04-18
2872,Extremely busy,went during spring break which may have been a mistake some great attractions but the crowds got bigger and bigger as the day went on the staff were really great and i struggle to comprehend how they keep that show on the road they deserve big pay rises if i returned i would go when school is in session compared to hong kong disney or the california adventure park it was very disappointing and as pricing is off the charts a let down given the distance travelled to reach it ,3,2018-04-18
2873,Not Up to Their Usual Standards,came to celebrate my wife s birthday she has some health issues which they always accommodated we don t mind standing in lines but due to my wife s health anything over minutes is a real problem in the past they would give us a pass that we need to wait minutes to get on the ride between rides we would generally people watch went to city hall and the employee said if my wife could not stand in line as long as required we should put her in a wheelchair and sit in line this is problematic due to the sun after gently discussing this we asked for the supervisor clarissa came and set us up with a pass that allowed us to get a pass for a ride and then wait just what we needed with the exception of the wait staff at river belle the employees acted as if they didn t want to be bothered we don t ask for much but had general questions regarding the time of different events very disappointing ,3,2018-04-18
2874,First time to where the Disney Magic all began,this was a fantastic experience two of my daughters joined my wife and i which made it even more enjoyable one of the greatest surprises here was that many of the original attractions and rides that no longer exist at disney world are still here plus you have the added bonus of the california park which is very similar to the studios in disney world but with some different rides and attractions to offer it was a great very worth while and fun experience for our family i would do it again in a heart beat ,5,2018-04-18
2875,The Characters are so patient and so amazing with the kids. Maxpass photos are a great bonus!,for the price i think you should really be able to go in and out of both the disney parks such a rip off that you can t experience both without paying way more we only went into the main disney park which was much busier than expected for a wednesday following all the spring breaks that being said we had an amazing day and were very impressed with the interactions of all the characters with the kids it was great to see the characters enjoying the rides as well bert and marry poppins were a huge hit the ride line ups are long but the disney app is a nice way to know which ones have the shortest wait times especially like the photographers that are around so you can get some quality group shots selfie stick confiscated our year old will be talking about his day in disneyland for years to come it really is magical ,4,2018-04-18
2876,Fun for Kids and Adults - Magical,we go to dl often and this trip was a kid free trip my husband and i had so much fun bring your patience because it s always busy but well worth the money to visit and play ,5,2018-04-17
2877,Happiest Place on Earth,must experience love this place top notch electric parade amazing great shops little expensive to get in and to eat expect to spend hundred for the day have been here at least times,5,2018-04-17
2878,Disney’s poor relation,visited disneyland ca yesterday and it s a massive disappointment small park lots of people and a massive disappointment when compared with orlando ,1,2018-04-16
2879,Family Trip,kids loved the park but the didn t like how the characters just walked right passed them when asking to take a picture with them the little one was hurt by it but that didn t stop her day she was super excited that darth vader chose her to join the dark side ,3,2018-04-16
2880,Disneyland is still a fun place.,seems more for smaller children now to me but was still fun space mt is still a good ride as are some of the other roller coasters pricing is crazy but people seem happy to pay so be ready for long lines and good family time ,4,2018-04-16
2881,Yes indeed - The Happiest Place on Earth!!!,go spend your money enjoy every minute take plenty of pictures ride as many rides as possible and see every attraction that your time will allow seeing disneyland with youngsters makes it all that more exciting there isn t a speck of dust or trash anywhere how do they do that it truly is the happiest place on earth you won t regret it ,5,2018-04-16
2882,All Cast Members were Grumpy,i have never seen so many disney cast members with such grumpy attitudes we found maybe or cast members who seemed to be enjoying their jobs otherwise they were sullen rude and poorly trained this really detracted from our much anticipated vacation disney also needs to find an alternative to their maxpass granted without it we would probably have missed a couple of attractions but in days we only used it times ,3,2018-04-16
2883,It is truly magical,this was our second visit in three years at the insistence of miss we stayed at the disneyland hotel which is great and i highly recommend staying at a disney hotel for the magic hour which gives you an hour before general public ie am disney is a very busy place and gets crowded quickly especially from about am onwards the fastpass system works well if you manage it correctly the fastpass basically allows you to skip the main queues for a ride but then doesn t allow you to fastpass again until a later time which is based on your time saved ie if you the normal line is min wait another fastpass will be available almost immediately if the line is mins yes they get this long and longer then you can t access another pass for two hours fastpass gives you an allotted hour window to use them just scan your entry ticket in the fp line when returning not the fp ticket in disneyland you cannot fastpass peter pan so if nostalgic rides are your thing do this early space mountain indiana jones and matterhorn are always very popular but indiana is over the other side of the park this means lots of walking to maximise the day for maximum benefit you can do something like this fp space mountain and ride it from normal queue if only min wait ride matterhorn go over too mark twain paddlesteamer get a fastpass for fantasmic show that night which is right near where you board the paddlesteamer this does count as a ride fp but gets you better seats for that show fp thunder mountain railroad whilst there go ride indiana then pirates if you have time then tmrr before heading back to sm again bang most major rides done and still lots of fps to use on rides where queues should not be as bad like haunted mansion astro blasters this is just an example splash mountain was closed for renovations this time the rides are a bit dated but still great fun nothing that requires you to be super adventurous we loved sm indiana and pirates disney now has maxpass a usd per day per person fastpass and photo system in one if you plan on getting all of the photos that disney staff may take with characters main photo points etc then it is worth it otherwise it is not just use normal fp system tip hand your camera or phone to disney staff they will take for you every time just though so be ready if you have much younger kids head to the back of the park toontown asap but do the alice and it s a small world on the way you must go to fantasmic show parade and fireworks if you go to fantasmic you can still see the fireworks from there not the other way around if you have a three day pass do one then the other dining of all types is available we preferred to go and do sit down meals as it gets you off your feet we averaged over kms a day at disney including the walk from the hotel into the park blue bayou is great nestled in pirates ride bookings well in advance essential for a cheap sit down head to eatery just before pooh area just past splash mountain cheaper also a bit nastier go get a seat right down back on the top deck overlooking the water fewer people and quite tranquil overall we loved disneyland but you need to be prepared for crowds waiting etc do your research and plan your day winging it could leave you frustrated ,5,2018-04-16
2884,Disneyland is an addiction!,my third time to disneyland and i don t think i will ever grow out of it my husband and i made a special trip to celebrate our anniversary and purchased a two day park hopper due to illness we couldn t use our second day and because we came from out of country wouldn t be staying to use it within the day deadline but at guest reservations they worked their disney magic and extended our deadline so we can come back anytime except blackout periods for the next yrs everyone was so kind and helpful it really is the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-04-16
2885,Gluten free /celiac,i ve been celiac my whole life the first time i went to disney i was back then not many options were there but as years went on there s plenty and i feel normal it s great i love visiting every year especially story teller cafe and goofys kitchen,5,2018-04-16
2886,Was not prepared for the scope of this place,this place is huge in every sense of the word overall a magical experience but sooo many people to the point where just walking around is frustrating we thought we would try and get there early to beat the crowds boy were we wrong there is a traffic jam of lanes just to get into the carpark then you line up for security then to get on the cart to take you to the entrance then to enter the park then comes the wait times for the rides i get it every one wants to come here and the park is impressive nonetheless the best things for us were finding the hidden gems like the little bird shack and the fried chicken at the restaurant a great day despite the crowds ,4,2018-04-15
2887,Disneyland is my happy place!,we have been to disneyland ca twice now from australia and loved it both times you have to do a lot of planning for disneyland i don t think you can just rock up there and magically expect to get the most out of the experience and lets face it it s an expensive experience when you travel from australia unless you put a little effort into the planning i absolutely love the early mornings into the park and i think it is well worth staying at a disney hotel so that you can get early morning entry every day into either disneyland or california adventure park we always stay at the grand californian as it is the most convenient the staff at disney are wonderful and each world has the cast members dressed in that attire eg the cars world staff are all dressed like formula racers disney caters very well for people with food issues our son is coeliac and at each restaurant the chef came out and personally spoke to us and then prepared our son s meal at a few places the chef even went off menu to accommodate us once the chef came out to the table saw that our son had polished off the meal very quickly and prepared him another one free of charge yes disney is expensive and yes you can go to cheaper places but i will guarantee you that everywhere else will feel second rate after you have done disney plan your day use the early morning entry and you will get a heap of rides done in that first hour use the fast pass system to get onto other popular rides whatever you do don t miss out on riding radiator springs racers at night it is spectacular use the fast pass system for this there is a stack of information you can get online about disneyland that will help with planning your trip if you are worried if some of the rides are too scary watch them on youtube and you will get a good sense of what they are like i m not a huge ride fan but the ones at disneyland and california adventure are very classy rather than terrifying ,5,2018-04-15
2888,Quick visit,well i have to say very disappointing after going to disney in florida and paris many times the staff were not nearly as nice and helpful we had a meal which was awful something i have never had to say about disney it was so packed for a small park and not nearly the same choice in places to eat and rides to go on the disney castle was so disappointing well it s back to florida and paris where they have it spot on ,3,2018-04-15
2889,So fun!,had visited disney in florida many times before but this was our first visit to disneyland the castle is so much smaller but we had just as much fun wonderful to experience the original park and see the similarities to the park in fl recommend visiting for fun and nostalgia ,5,2018-04-15
2890,Happiest and most expensive place on earth!,carry in water and snacks everything in the park is expensive strollers are a must do glad we had one for our year old photo pass and fast pass were worth the extra money ,4,2018-04-15
2891,Amazing,st visit to a disney park and it didn t disappoint mickey mouse was the st character we spotted but the queue for a photo was ridiculously long so gave it a miss the fireworks on the night were breathtaking then fantasmic water show was mind blowing the whole experience was one i will remember forever truly magical,5,2018-04-15
2892,My favorite place!,my family loves disneyland i go about times a year because it s so fun great vacation for a family the cream cheese stuffed pretzels are the best lots of good rides for all ages ,5,2018-04-15
2893,Vacatiom,disneyland was very nice but differant from florida still great experiance did not stay here but wished we did,4,2018-04-15
2894,Magical,disney is a magical place i have an annual pass the cheapest version of the annual pass that doesn t allow me to go on the weekends and i like it that way i feel like i usually miss the crazy large crowds and go on days when it is fairly easy to get on rides customer service is always the best so much delicious food obviously very expensive but it s worth it to have a special treat you definitely want to visit and if you re local i recommend the annual pass ,5,2018-04-15
2895,Slightly overrated,most attractions were really awesome star wars simulator the toy story ride autopia the jungle boat ride the lines were always really long day park hopper highly recommended,4,2018-04-15
2896,The original Disneyland,we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to disneyland it has a different and more relaxed vibe than magic kingdom queue times were not too bad and we enjoyed all the halloween decor and events ,4,2018-04-14
2897,Family Adventure,disneyland is disneyland this was the first time for our two grandchildren we took our son back in and his wife had never been overseas what an experience we stmbled in on spring break what a learning for some aussies wall to wall people but the place is designed to cope learn to use the fastpass system ,5,2018-04-14
2898,Great day out,had a wonderful day in the park took a cab from long beach and was there in time for opening no queues to enter even though it was good friday fast passes were brilliant ensuring you got on all the main rides a little expensive to get in for a day ticket but if you re a disney fan it s worth it ideally i would have stayed in anaheim and had a three day pass weather was fabulous got on all the rides that i wanted and had lunch in the horse shoe saloon plenty to do for a full day watched the fireworks and fantasmic show my only disappointment was that there was no parade but everything else was perfect had an amazing day and everyone was so friendly ,5,2018-04-14
2899,Must Do,what child doesn t enjoy the magic of disney and what adult for that matter can say no to a day of disney fun we are annual pass holders and visit here frequently driving hours each way for the day or staying in a local hotel if we can get a good deal favorites are the tiki room fantasmic any of the dark rides small world pirates haunted mansion and strolling main street we don t frequent toon town mostly because there is little to no shade although our little ones enjoy the little playground area near pluto s house try to get in line to entry minutes before rope drop and remember security takes quite awhile to get through upon opening buy tickets before it is worth it fast passes are a must for indiana jones space mountain and splash mountain if it is warm get a fast pass for fantasmic you won t regret it ,5,2018-04-14
2900,Still a kid at heart!,when it comes to disneyland i m still the biggest kid at heart the second you step inside inside the park you feel the magical buzz having visited so many times as a child it is still amazing as an adult but as adult you notice all of the little details that are generally overlooked as a child ,5,2018-04-14
2901,Always special,disney always aims to please we never leave disappointed love the matterhorn macaroons and fried pickles ,5,2018-04-14
2902,"It's just ""Ok""",i went with my wife after about a year period since my last time at the park we live nearby in san diego so visiting the park is not something that we have to go out of our way to do as far as travel which may be why im so jaded we thought it was going to be a blast but honestly disneyland just isn t that great i know it s for children but even still it s just a little underwhelming the park is starting to show its age i am a thrill rides type of person so getting on a bunch of nostalgia novelty rides just doesnt do it for me i feel like they rely on their brand instead of trying to actually evolve sure they add new stuff but the classic rides could use some tlc like change the plot lines move some stuff around something now of course you expect theme parks to be pricey everyone knows these places are over priced and you really can t complain however if you are going to charge an arm and a leg to eat offer better choices i ve been to nearly ever food stand and resturaunt in both disney and cali adv it s typical theme park fare corndogs chicken tenders turkey legs and all that stuff is cool and fine but you d just expect more from disneyland the sit in resturaunts require credit cards for reservations and charge per person to cancel are you serious what if i had a child and something happened what if i m stuck in line somewhere what if i just don t want to eat there anymore just seems a little ridiculous you won t lose money if i cancel the lines to eat at these places are always crazy cafe orleans carnation cafe are pretty popular but i just find the food to be so bland they really pride themselves on these restaurants but i honestly just don t think they re worth it again it s the novelty the restaurants are themed and wonderfully decorated but at bucks a plate the food should maybe have some seasoning disneyland gets major points for being the only theme park that doesn t charge for fast passes we hold annual passes for universal studios and knotts and both charge for an all day fast pass all in all we had an ok day arrived before opening am and had seen the entire park twice and were ready to go by pm i can understand taking kiddos to their favorite characters and have a blast or even just to have your first time there however if you re an adult group or duo and you ve been before i d say skip it it probably hasn t changed since you were there last there are so many fun things nearby and they all cost way less ,3,2018-04-14
2903,The Happiest Place on Earth,great time very short lines great weather could not have asked for anything more enjoyed everything except the matterhorn way too bumpy and brain shaking for senior citizens ,5,2018-04-14
2904,So much to do - we loved it!,we went to the parks for three consecutive days and never ran out of things to do i was worried that my year old who is currently afraid of most rides wouldn t have fun but she loved it there s a good mix of scary rides for the adults and mild rides activities for the younger ones the fastpass system is easy to use we only used it a couple of times for the rides that get long wait times space mountain matterhorn and the big thunder mountain railroad the adults and my year old loved all the rides mostly the queues are very easy to manage there s lots going on and friendly people to talk to do the time passes quickly ,5,2018-04-14
2905,The worst place ever,this park is the worst park ever do not come to this park the system of the lines are so bad no fest lines in here it is so so bad you pay a lot of money and come to enjoy instead you deal with an application on the phone that gives no answer the park sells more tickets than it can offer in the rides the line for each ride lasts for more than two hours it s a disgrace this is not the place to be ,1,2018-04-14
2906,Happiest Place on Earth,it s disneyland what more can you say great rides characters entertainment and heaps of food options best advice is to download the disney app and purchase a max pass for an additional per person per day this then allows you to fast pass on the app using the parks free wifi and also includes all the professional photos that are taken in the park you show the photographer a qr code and they are then linked to your app for you to download within a month ,5,2018-04-13
2907,Winter break !,this place is good for a new experience the fantasy make you to feel like a child and kids enjoy it very much have good choices in food and drinks compare to other parks make sure you arrive before door opens to enjoy it all ,5,2018-04-13
2908,2 day park hopper ticket,we spent days at disneyland and california adventure park on a hopper tickets and despite the crowds had a great time in fact the crowds never really were an issue we used the disneyland app extensively and i would highly recommend this we also used max pass which allowed us to do fast pass selections on the mobile device at a higher frequency then standard this was awesome and allowed us to do heaps of rides we otherwise would have done also we used e tickets on entry and didn t do the print thing the other piece of advice was with kids days is required and if you want to sit down for lunch do it by mid day latest what a fantastic time we had,5,2018-04-13
2909,Spring break 2018,get the maxpass with photo pass we were able to ride most rides or times we did about k steps so bring good shoes ,5,2018-04-13
2910,Had a great time!!,we had a great time here at disneyland i highly recommend using the max pass feature on your cell phone we were able to go on rides using the feature including the ever awesome space mountain to me that is the best ride in the park i did not like the star wars virtual ride at all it was loud and obnoxious and i don t need more virtual anything so if you feel the same then skip this ride i also suggest getting to the park by in the morning the security check and lines to get in were the worst part of the experience also forget the myth that every employee is always friendly most are but we were exposed to the reality that the happiest place on earth can and does have some cranky employees the watermelon they sell at the food stands was so juicy and made me think of summer in april we are native new jerseyians but have never been to the florida disney to me this park seems to be the perfect size for a theme park we were tired but not exhausted and felt we saw many great attractions i d love to go back here again ,5,2018-04-13
2911,Dream come true,amazing themepark definitely a most do in la i totally can recommend the cars ride i was disappointed by pirates of the caribbean bring your pick nick if you don t want to spend per meal,5,2018-04-13
2912,"So much fun, so little time",the place is magical there is so much fun to do for every member of the family that you can never have enough time rides are good and fastpass is a blessing i went to other parks including universal studios but the fastpass free service that disneyland provides is unmatched the night show fantasmic and fireworks were too good to be true fully enjoyed it and would love to go there again ,5,2018-04-12
2913,Magical as always,what can i say except this was our visit here and it is magical as ever while busy we used fast passes when possible try not to rush things just enjoy the atmosphere don t forget the snacks either first off get a dole whip served outside of the tiki room turkey legs giant pickles the baking oh my can t wait to return stop by city hall to get yourself a button if you are celebrating anything we came on our honeymoon and returned this month to celebrate our th ,5,2018-04-12
2914,Where dreams die!,if you have teenagers forget it they won t be interested in this hugely outdated over rated theme park the so called fast pass is a joke we arrived at and couldn t get on our ride of choice until this wasn t a peak period lines are too long for rides that are very underwhelming and haven t changed in years do yourself a favour take them to six flags your kids will love you more if you want nostalgia rewatch a movie and save yourself the pain ,1,2018-04-12
2915,fun all day long,i know a lot of people immediately like to complain about the lines and prices but it s all well worth it both disneyland and california adventure are of my favorite places to visit in california i know why it s referred to as the happiest place on earth it s because it makes you forget about the rest of the world for a bit and take in all the great features of the park this includes the rides food and definitely the characters walt disney was a genius for coming up with such a great and enjoyable place like disneyland i can t wait to plan my rd trip to the parks soon ,5,2018-04-12
2916,Wonderful day at Disney!,expectations were high for the entire family and disneyland did not disappoint we d been to disneyworld in fl but never disneyland we really liked the smaller size of disneyland the weather was perfect during the day but got chilly at night not sure what we were thinking but we didn t bring enough layers so most of us were pretty cold by the end of the day ,5,2018-04-12
2917,Great day out,i have been to both disney parks in america and this one was great much quieter than florida but equally as good make sure you get the fastpasses with your ticket as saves the queue time massively and watch the frozen show it was fantastic there is wifi in the park ,5,2018-04-12
2918,Outstanding,this was my first back to disneyland since and the magic is still there the integrity of the original park is still apparent and everyone we encountered were spectacular it was my birthday when we visited and i was given a happy birthday button at the mad hatter shop on main st all day staff members and random guests were wishing me happy birthday which was very cool and speaks to the atmosphere of the park we made several reservations at blue bayou restaurant french quarter cafe orleans and carnation cafe which were all fantastic and the food was top notch as were or servers we spent two days in the and stayed hours the first day and hours the nd and i would go back tomorrow just a wonderful couple of days spent with fun rides beautiful landscaping and employees who very obviously love to work there thank you to disneyland for a memorable birthday visit ,5,2018-04-11
2919,Fun for younger children,we traveled here in april on a monday which was supposed to be a quieter day for disney although it was quite busy for the size of the park we have been to the main one in orlando so all i can do is compare the two different parks first this one is smaller and seems to cater to children and under while orlando has more rides for older kids there were many rides that malfunction during the day but are quickly repaired and back up and running within the hour fast passes can be purchased at certain rides only and you are only allowed so many at a time so plan your rides accordingly as they fill up fast it is best to go at open and get on as many rides as you can because with in the first hour wait times increase significantly there is parking conviently located close to the trams that take you directly to the parks i would recommend packing water and food as it can get very expensive if you eat inside the parks all day if wanting the true disney experience i would say go to orlando since it offers more over all it was a great day and i recommend going there at least once ,4,2018-04-10
2920,The OG Disneyland!,disneyland california is the most magical of all the disney parks disney world orlando has more to do but disneyland has that old school magic that you can feel from the moment you step foot there i highly recommend paying the extra per ticket to get the fastpasses on your phone and planning what you want to do before you get there to maximize ride time don t miss the fireworks it s the most magical part ,5,2018-04-10
2921,Worth a Visit,the original disneyland park is still worth a visit super crowded even during weekdays almost all of the rides have a long wait of roughly minutes so fast lane is totally worth it try all the food stalls churros corn dogs mickey pretzel mickey ice cream fireworks starts at pm not many characters roaming around the park and the night carnival won t start until april which is a big downside fried chicken at plaza inn is a must try ,4,2018-04-10
2922,Met all our expectations,visited the disney parks from australia and were delighted we allowed three days for our visit and bought the hopper pass to allow switching between parks we also made heavy use of the free disney app and bought the daily max pass including photo priviledges which we found to be excellent giving us the ability to book fast passes on attractions without running all over the park the photo s taken by the park photographers were very good we also used free online planning sites before we arrived to help outline our daily plan for the parks and while we modified our plans upon arrival still found them very useful the parks are expensive but i think they offer real value for money and a fabulous experience the visit took me back to my boyhood and allowed me to re live some of the excitement i felt as a boy when swept away in a disney show the attractions themselves were first rate the park was immaculately clean and in great repair staff were attentive friendly knowlegable efficient and helpful they really were without exception great and a credit to the parks my only negative is that after three days my feet were just about worn down to stumps but i can t blame the parks for that for me this experience was peerless and one that you should definitely do before you die it s just that good ,5,2018-04-09
2923,Hands in the air kinda day,amazing so different from walt disney world in a small quaint kinda way all of magic of wdw but in a smaller compact space i liked disneyland much better for this reason alone the attractions are much the same and the crowds are far less i felt over run by adult scooters and baby strollers at walt disney world i felt the character experience were way better at disneyland storm troopers walked right up to us the the evil queen actually spoke sarcasm to us and the lines were much faster without magic bands they still use paper fast passes we were there in early january so it was still decorated for christmas my hands were in the air on roller coaster all day long since the lines were so much quicker ,5,2018-04-09
2924,Disappointed by the amount of refurbishments,went with the family in february we knew it was refurb time in the park before we went and booked however was disappointed that the didn t stagger the rides etc that were closed instead we arrived and heaps of things were closed all at the same time including heaps of main street being closed off,3,2018-04-09
2925,C’mon It’s Disney!!!,excellent amazing clean so much fun advice get the fast pass and use it make dinner reservations at least a week before you go get a pass that allows you to go from one park to the next wait until you re leaving the park before you buy souvenirs you may decide you really don t want them and you won t have to carry them around all day take up to days if you can we only had one charge all your phones so great for communication if you split up and for safety read up before you go learn about what s offered and make a flexible itinerary ,5,2018-04-09
2926,A world of its own,been going to disney since years old and still to this day nearly years on i love every minute of the breath taking experience of being in a disney theme park disney really does put the theme into theme park taking you into a whole new world when you walk through those gates every second and every inch of your visit is meticulously made with the disney magic i must say i was told the disneyland in california was the best in the world although i disagree while comparing it to my euro disneyland experience both times i had friends that didn t want to join me and within minutes of entering the park they were both blown away and couldn t wait to go back for day love the new app allowing you to fast pass via your phone i do think limiting it to fast pass per ticket is kinda bad and unfair but completely understandable i guess considering i waited over hours twice for rides i would recommend putting food and drink karts in the lines and maybe only manning them when lines get to be on wait times over an hour also i think there could be an improvement made for those parents who are lining up for their kids it annoyed me to constantly see family members pushing through the line to meet up with their mum or dad who has been waiting in line for an hour especially when some of them are extremely rude when making their way through the line i absolutely loved the updated tower of terror was a massive fan of the old one but they have definitely done an amazing job to capture the new generation also if you could update the app with toilet locations that would be great overall loved it definitely making my next vacation another trip to disney theme parks ,5,2018-04-09
2927,Disney dorks,my husband and i are self confessed disney dorks this time we wore our aussie disney dork badges with pride and we received a lot of comments they prove to be a great ice breaker when you are waiting in queues if you are going i highly recommend wearing something with an aussie theme you will be amazed at the amount of people who will talk to you ,5,2018-04-09
2928,Disney Addict,i am biased i love disneyland since my first visit at age ten i am an adult and celebrated my th birthday last year there i have a few disney friends who live in california that i go with i believe everyone should experience disneyland once in their lifetime if you can t have fun there then you probably are a boring person if you aren t a ride person there is plenty to see and do there are multiple tours that talk about walt and the history behind the park ride the train or monorail see the show in the air conditioned tiki room eat some great food and the easiest is just people watch you never know what celebrities you will see enjoying the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-04-09
2929,Great place for family vacation,loved this park my teenage kids had a wonderful time lines get long for rides but if you play your cards right you can time your rides plus the lines do move fast and they keep things moving they have wonderful shows and everyone is really nice this place was really magical ,5,2018-04-09
2930,Absolutely Wonderful,so i just visited disneyland yesterday and all i can say is is that it s absolutely wonderful in my opinion a lot of people underrate disneyland but in truth it still has that same magic that it had when it first opened in here s my advice when visiting the park and this goes for disney california adventure too do your research a lot of people miss out because they don t make reservations for popular restaurants or they don t know the times for certain activities or parades be sure to research anything and everything about the park before you go way before you go that includes restaurants parades fireworks anything some people say the food isn t worth it don t listen to them part of the experience is trying all of the delicious food disneyland and dca have to offer my all time favorite restaurant is blue bayou where if you eat there for lunch you can get the best food in the park the monte cristo sandwich here s a tip the monte cristo sandwich is no longer on the menu but they will still make it for you if you ask also don t forget to try all of the snack food too i m talking about dole whips pretzels the jalapeno cheese pretzels are the best churros turkey legs and even pickles just remember calories don t count at disneyland don t judge a book by its cover or more specifically lands a lot of people i notice have this common dialogue tomorrowland is boring fantasyland is for babies what the heck is frontierland here s some sound advice get used to the lay of the land before you go you can achieve this by downloading the disneyland app find out where the exact locations of all the rides and lands are and you ll be better off than the people trying to get around using a paper map also explore the lands there s so much to see and do no matter what land you are in well that s pretty much it my advice is to do as much research as much as possible before going and that should make things run much smoother if i m planning on doing a longer vacation to disneyland my favorite hotel is the disneyland hotel but i will do a separate review on that later ,5,2018-04-08
2931,Funamazing to live a childhoid dream of visiting,amazing to live a childhood dreambof visiting disneyland not my first visit andceach time makes you feel like a child again it pays to plan work out visit to be here on a weekday early weekrnds and hols busy of course do shops last as open later try bring some good and drinks as queus and food expensive but is something to experience at least once in your life be you a kid or a big kid like me but try to experience with close family as will br a lifetime memory,5,2018-04-08
2932,Getting pricey,disneyland is always a great place for a family outing and has always been e pensive for a family but the prices are getting out of hand we paid for adults and for small children for our family one day cost almost not including hotel and food if one stayed several days to a week as some due it could easily cost more than a family vacation in many places around the world disney has tried to make upgrades to some of the rides also the max pass which is per day is worth the extra you can get the pictures taken by the professional photographers downloaded to your app and phone also it makes waiting in line much easier with the fast pass fantastic was amazing as usual and we recommend getting there early to get the fast pass which are given by the riverboat the fireworks can also be seen there after the first showing which was helpful several of the rides had breakdowns during the day raising the question of needed maintenance due to the age of many of the rides although everyone had a very enjoyable experience we will be going less often due to the increased prices we used to go several times a year but it will now likely be years before we try to go again disney is pricing itself out of the average family market ,3,2018-04-08
2933,Where has all the magic gone?,i ve only been to the disneyland resort two prior times in my life once in across several days and again in across several days this was my third time at the resort and my first time with a wife and baby for the sake of context i visited walt disney world in and it was magical to say the least disneyland however seems to have lost the magic somewhere along the way for the most part service from employees was great there were few unfriendly or surly employees this is true for everyone from cashiers to servers to photopass people considering that i paid extra for photopass privileges i feel as though the photographers should have been overall much more friendly especially the one that was shooting for minnie mouse in toontown i think she took three pictures and didn t even bother to scan my app no smile nothing definitely the low point of service on the trip with the exception of refreshment corner which is in a separate review in three days with just two adults and a year old baby we were able to do everything we wanted to do multiple times we took advantage of the single rider lines used the app and used fastpass to get on the rides we wanted to ride the longest line we waited in the entire trip was only thirty minutes some rides we were able to get a fastpass and take it straight to the gate skipping a fifteen minute line i typically will buy drinks and things in the park for the sake of being on vacation but the price of soda has finally become too high for me to justify buying it in the park this time i drove to a nearby store bought soda kept it in the fridge overnight and brought it with me into the park two years ago i was wiling to pay for a large coke but is finally too high for me to even consider let s face it is a lot in the first place but ticking up the prices has finally led me to call it quits on park purchased drinks the guests are a rather unpleasant bunch i know there isn t much disney can do about it but the absolute worst park guests were the ones who dressed like they were in biker gangs with idiotic names like tomorrowland avengers on them it s probably about time disney cracked down on that the other guests i disliked felt the need to dress up in a theme i found myself mobbed by dozens of guests who were dressed as adventureland whether they looked like they just got back from an archaeological dig or were dressed like they could blend into the tiki room they were bothersome too finally the other guests that caused problems are those who feel the need to scream in your ear when the lights go out in the stretching room in the haunted mansion seriously stop that crap it s not funny and it s unpleasant to those around you you re in a place where people spend a lot of money to attend act like it the food at maurice s treats is terrible we both got a pastry twist mine was the gray stuff which i had previously in the magic kingdom and hers was the strawberry both were dry and void of flavor at apiece that was a good wasted on very bad pastries the baby center is fabulous and very convenient when traveling with a baby or toddler we made good use of it to get warm water for bottles and to change our baby they unfortunately did not carry our brand of formula so it necessitated a trip out to the hotel in order to retrieve more when we inadvertently ran out otherwise it was very nice to have a clean dedicated space to change our baby s diapers if needed we would have also used the space for feeding too tomorrowland is officially the low point of disneyland it is very likely that i will skip tomorrowland next time i visit with the possible exception of buzz lightyear astro blasters everything looks cheap and dated in tomorrowland and much of it is just ugly wasted space space mountain which was once my favorite ride has plummeted toward the bottom of my list of best attractions at the park it was practically pitch black there was no music and it was just cold it wasn t very thrilling to just sit in the dark with cold wind in my face i could simulate the experience by turning on my air conditioner and turning off the lights at home what happened to all the stars what happened to the surfer rock or the spacey music why was it just dark and silent the only sounds i heard on the ride were the startled screams of those who presumably haven t been on a roller coaster before the rest of tomorrowland is bland and dull although we did enjoy meeting darth vader and chewbacca in the star wars launch bay darth vader was great he lectured my baby as having much to learn about the force that was truly fantastic and the only highlight of tomorrowland fantasy land was great so was frontier land and new orleans square my new favorite part of the park it was disappointing that most of main street was blocked off and that splash mountain was closed but i still felt like it was okay i can t be mad that disney is refurbishing parts of the park they ll just be that much better when i inevitably return new orleans square was the site of most entertainment with excellent musicians and performers one member of a band gave my little baby some mardi gras beads which was a nice gesture also in new orleans square i found myself annoyed with a small group of cast members when one of them felt the need to point at my family and excitedly shout matching shirts matching shirts matching shirts yes we went to the disney store two months prior to our trip and bought some matching pajamas and we wore the shirts on our first day at least they weren t those generic cheaply printed personalized shirts with mom and brother on them regardless i don t need cast members pointing at my family and yelling their observations regardless of the good parts of the trip i can t help but feel like the magic has left disneyland the entire walt disney world resort had a magical feeling with the possible exception of epcot but disneyland and california adventure seem void of the disney magic that goes double for dca i ll be back but it will be different since disneyland is beginning to feel like just another amusement park i ll be treating it like just another amusement park i ll bring my own drinks i ll pack in some food and i ll expect very little in terms of service and magic i ll miss the magic and the feeling i have when i have a nice in park meal or purchase a nice park souvenir but that s just a part of the disappearing magic when the magic goes so does my money besides i have just another amusement park right here at home as a few closing comments i hate the addition of johnny depp to pirates of the caribbean and i m disappointed that the bride auction is now gone i m glad i got to see it before it left disney seems bent on changing attractions to a point where they are virtually unrecognizable tom sawyer island is interesting but there s not a lot to it this was my first trip to a disney park where i could not find a single souvenir that i was personally interested in we bought our baby three toys and two outfits my wife got a shirt for herself but i was expecting to buy a lot more photopass was overall worthwhile but some of the photographers need some help with their friendliness ,3,2018-04-08
2934,"The Original, Smaller than Orlando. But Loved it.",i m a grown man loving all things disney from the disney cruise to orlando s walt disney world i ve always wanted to visit the very st park walt created i was not disappointed i traveled with my wife and son to celebrate his b day and some spring break vacation it s definitely smaller than orlando but hey less walking didn t use the new maxpass we just got there very early every day and with planned rides in mind we had no trouble with long lines my son s favorite was cars land when the park would start to get crowded we would leave for lunch and some downtime and we would come back in the evening if you want to ride the monorail s st car with the conductor it s best if you get there early this way you can request a cast member and enjoy we did it several times great view for pics and video my advice is get there before it opens and take advantage of the magic morning you ll have a better chance at all the popular rides ,5,2018-04-08
2935,Disneyland in Spring!,nothing beats visiting disneyland in the spring the trees and flowers are blooming and baby ducks everywhere you look we spent a beautiful day taking in the sights and sounds of mickey s home crowds were manageable best time to go for weather reasons and end of spring break take advantage of the max pass it will save you so much time by not standing in long lines all ages will enjoy disneyland it s a magical place to spend your day ,5,2018-04-08
2936,FastPass app (MaxPass) is great!,we only had one day for our family of three to spend at disneyland it was per person our son is yo and we paid extra pp for the fastpass feature on our mobile app we purchased everything through the mobile app iphone the night before the mobile app for using fastpass is called maxpass we went on a wednesday morning during spring break which is peak season taking the tram from the parking lot to front gates is about minutes so factor in that travel time there was no magic morning at disneyland that day so the crowds were not too bad when we showed up at am to enter the park we immediately signed up for a fastpass thru the app so you don t have to walk to the ride for a physical fastpass ticket for one of the major rides space mountain and began to ride rides that had about a minute wait i kept on signing up for fastpasses as soon as i could throughout the day i probably did about fastpass rides and never stood in line more than minutes on any ride period only disneyland rides offer fastpass there was one fastpass ride where we stood about min because of equipment issues but on the whole the fastpass lines were minutes another reason for the the fastpass is that we got free photos through photopass on the maxpass app from the rides and the professional disney photographers they scan your qr code on your app or you enter the photo id from the ride photo and voila it eventually shows up on your app and you can download the high res photo for your own record or pay them to print and frame it we got through most of the rides we wanted to ride by pm it was no warmer than degrees the day we went in early april and cloudy most of the morning ideal conditions i highly recommend the fried chicken at the plaza inn we also got the dole whip float near the tiki hut in frontierland although the line was minutes hot dog on a stick was good lots of corn bread though funnel cake in new orleans was ok too crispy we wanted to stay for the fireworks but were too tired disney does skew toward the younger kids with things like its a small world type rides universal skews more for teenagers as our son grows older disney parks will be less interesting than universal parks an awesome day it ain t cheap but worth it for the family fun and memories the premium you pay for disneyland is for the cleanliness of the park professionalism of staff and overall very high quality of the experience disneyland is a finely tuned machine from parking to managing queues ,5,2018-04-08
2937,NAM Day with the Little Princesses,it was fun for the kids the entry line to get in was so congested you would think if we were there with national american miss that we would have a special entrance but nope ,3,2018-04-08
2938,Did Not Need A Fast Pass,me and my family attended on a monday which fell on a value day which ended up being cheaper than a peak day this was our first time attending disneyland since we frequented disney world in florida it was okay i brought my year old and year old and it seemed that this park was geared more towards the littles ones the longest we stood in line was minutes due to the crowd we were able to get on most of the rides before leaving five hours after arrival we did not need a fast pass at all we were also able to take in one show parking was convenient at a shuttle took you to the front entrance main street was closed up partially due to construction and a lot of rides were closed due to construction i think next time we will try the adventure park which is adjacent to the entrance of disneyland tip dont bring any selfie sticks phone tripods they are not allowed in the park mines was confiscated by security upon check in ,3,2018-04-08
2939,Very fun,went to disney land with people we had a great time and the place was clean as always it was crowded but it is spring time most of the attractions were up and running there was long lines but with fast passes made it better good job much better than california adventure there not that great,5,2018-04-07
2940,"Smaller park, easier to navigate",we are seasoned wdw travelers and this was a new experience for us fastpass system needs an overhaul desperately need better food options especially quick service options ,4,2018-04-07
2941,"Fun, but it’s not Disney World.",we love all things disney from annual disney cruise line cruises to several trips to disney world every year so i really wanted to love disneyland and i did love the history of the place and a few of the rides are indeed better at disneyland pirates of the caribbean space mountain autopia my analysis six flags at disney prices with a enough magic mixed in to keep people coming back it s small not as clean as disney world and the cast members aren t as friendly or knowledgeable some were downright bitter i ve been going to disney world since i was and in nearly four decades i never had a cm complain to me about not getting their break i know it s an older park but we were in lines where the rides were stopped for operational or mechanical issues too many trains in the dome on space mountain safety first but that s a new one i was warned by more than a few friends that disney world sets the bar so high i d be a little disappointed if i m in oc again i ll skip the park and go to trader sams at the disneyland hotel that was my favorite disneyland attraction ,4,2018-04-07
2942,Annual Pass holders family of 6,i was born and raised in socal and i have been coming to disneyland for decades i am now and with the hubby recently retiring from marine corps we are able to do more with the kids there use to be days that were not so busy at disneyland but now there is just no telling what the day will be like it is insanely packed these last few years even just getting into a parking structure is a pain and on some days has taken me minutes because i have had to circle multiple times when you do finally park the security has now moved to that area which has help with the congestion near the front gates trams can take a bit on busy days when you are finally inside one of the parks on busy days the crowds are crazy inside as well not just on attractions but just walking to get to the attractions can be a challenge disneyland and dca disneys california adventure now have a max pass that you can purchase and it is worth it it saves you on walking time and you will appreciate that i have walked steps in a day on regular between parks the max pass also gives you unlimited photo downloads for that day a few tips one day is not enough if you are visiting you will need at least a to day hopper ticket to enjoy it all the princess makeover at the castle books up quickly so make a reservation asap if your princess wants this makeover jedi training in tomorrowland also fills up quick so you will want to get to that asap to sign up for a slot over at dca the carsland ride runs out of fasttrack passes super quick but they do offer single rider and if you don t mind your group being broken up then that is also a great way to get on faster make sure you download the disneyland app before you get there it will give you ride times character locations dining shops restrooms shows and a few other things it is where you can request a fastpass when you add on maxpass to your ticket you can also reserve dining on there as well the blue bayou and ariels grotto fill up quick ,3,2018-04-07
2943,1st visit - It's amazeballs!,we heeded others advise and downloaded the disney app to manage our fast passes and plan our day and we had such an awesome time as a result the fast pass system is amazing and does not hurt the hip pocket when you add up the time it will save you standing in line the parks are open from early til very late and do everything they can to offer all of their attractions we missed out on the fireworks show due to wind but still got to see the light show side of this attraction and did not leave too disappointed all in all our days spent in the happiest place on earth truly were also watch out for the ducks they re everywhere ,5,2018-04-07
2944,Spring break trip,we have come up with ideas to help disneyland be better they could use more food places things like burgers and fries the fast pass distribution should be close to the entrance of the ride ,4,2018-04-07
2945,Overrated and crowded,if somebody tells you that they are going to disney for days then believe them with the crowd and long queue for pretty much every attraction you won t be able to complete a fraction of attraction in day i don t hate crowds but the density of the crowd in disneyland is insane it is an ocean of people and there are hours of wait time for pretty much every attraction including simple disney rail road wait time on the disney app is not close to real wait time and it is actually way higher fast pass helps to some extent with a few rides yes many attractions do not have fast passes but you are not guaranteed to get them for the time of your convenience and they are very limited we could get fast pass for four attractions only in a single day other than that there are many good bits if there are more such disneys and the crowd is less then it definitely deserves stars universal studios is much better with express pass option our disneyland experience was average at best ,3,2018-04-07
2946,The magic of Disney,disney is magical for all ages and it really is the happiest place on earth last time i had been to disney was as a child this time i m in my s and it was just as magical i went with my husband who had never been to disney but had dreamt of going as a kid and he loved it i felt like a carefree kid again we enjoyed the train ride around the park and the submarine the best we aren t big roller coaster fans they had this amazing show in the evening called fantasmic and it was out of this world initially i thought the ticket was expensive but it was so worth every single penny ,5,2018-04-07
2947,Expensive Day,came here in easter sunday this year my year old son really wanted to go i balked at the admission for three one day passes we spent nine hours here had a great time long lines for in about rides so one per hour lol disney is a magical place with a magical price ,4,2018-04-07
2948,Plan ahead to avoid long line ups,we have been to disneyland times it always busy especially during spring break and summer times plan ahead to avoid long line ups we always go for the hopper tickets so we can go between the parks on the same day for first time visitor i recommend a day hopper go early to avoid long line ups take advantage of the magic morning access download the disneyland app to view wait times and show times for the events buy the maxpass per ticket to get your fastpass using your phone without going to each distribution location and you get all the photos from the disney photographers get your fastpass early populate rides in california adventure are radiator springs racers cars land guardians of the galaxy and soarin around world if you don t want to get wet on the grizzly river run ensure to bring a poncho populate rides in disneyland park include space mountain and indiana jones disneyland allows you to bring your own food and drink if you want to save money you can ask for a cup of water at any food outlets without buying a bottle of water if you want to save some money on disneyland merchandise you can get some products from the targets store nearby ,4,2018-04-07
2949,Download the app to save line time!!,we wish we had known about the app on our first day but figured it out by the end of the second we saved a ton of time by getting fast passes on our phone and looking up wait times before walking across the park for the ride we wanted definitely download the disneyland app if you plan to go ,5,2018-04-06
2950,Family Trip,i love disneyland but they need to find a way to get people through the lines quicker you spend a lot of money to stand around and wait the cost of food is a bit high considering the cost of park entrance i would love to see some improvements in their photo options for rides as there are only a couple rides that offer it also the app needs major improvements disney world has a great option for fast passes and electronic bracelets that disneyland should do as well ,3,2018-04-06
2951,Hungry Bear Food,perhaps the worst fish sandwich i have ever been served stale bun with old frozen deep fried fish the hamburger was very good and thoroughly enjoyed by the kids not a complainer type just wanted to give a heads up ,1,2018-04-06
2952,Loved it,my whole family loved being here downside is that the lines are really long and you stand in line for up to minutes deffinatley recommend getting the max pass,5,2018-04-05
2953,Mobbed,we went on a monday mid morning it was ok when we arrived parking easy shuttle easy easy to get in an hour or so later though it was just beyond crowded could barely walk attractions seemed unappealing and took an eternity to experience even with fastpass we could have spent the day doing something different and it almost certainly would have been more fun i try to live without regret but considering what it cost in time and money i wish we had skipped it ,2,2018-04-04
2954,First time to Disneyland,this spring break i took my and year olds to disneyland for the first time they both loved the experience i enjoyed it more then they did probably i had not been to disneyland in over years and it was so fun enjoying some of the favorites i remembered and also experiencing all the new attractions the wait times were what i expected for spring break and the characters were accessible and fun to see i also brought my year old who loved it just as much as the little girls ,5,2018-04-04
2955,Wonderful,we searched the internet and found a site with a forecast predictor calendar and figured out what days would work best to go we picked days that were considered as ghost town days worked great we hit every ride with no real wait times we purchased our tickets at the gate along with the recommended a disney phone app it was per person per day extra well worth it when you want to see and do everything showed real wait times and you can select your fastpass from your phone plus you can download all the photos from rides to your phone this was perfect for us one of my favorites was meeting chewbacca at the star wars launch bay had a wonder days with our park hopper we felt like big kids so much fun we brought in our own snacks and water with no issues ,5,2018-04-04
2956,Awesome,we are frequent visitors to disney world but i ve never been to disneyland before in short this was awesome accessibility to the rides is somewhat more efficient than at disney world wait times were generally lower the park was extremely clean the service friendly and efficient and overall it was a wonderful trip we liked the different takes on rides from orlando that we are accustomed to we stayed at the grand californian hotel and could walk to the park a very refreshing contrast to disney world where planning for your entire day with respect to location rides and transportation is the key to a great day everything just felt a lot more relaxed we will definitely be back ,5,2018-04-04
2957,Lifetime memories,we have been coming here for years from australia it is a quick hr direct flight from melbourne and voila the happiest place on earth i m excited about the new changes especially the opening up of the new star wars land soon plus the updated star tours ride which incorporates all the new movies and settings absolutely amazing also i have noticed space mountain matterhorn bobsled big thunder mountain pirates of the caribbean has been tweaked to keep up with all the new changes at dca there s also single rider options available great if you want to ride but the kids are old enough to look after themselves we made use of it for indiana jones we had fun recreating a picture we took on our first trip to disneyland in what a great place to form childhood memories ,5,2018-04-04
2958,Loved it!,our first time at disneyland and during spring break no less i was worried it would be too busy and crazy while it was very busy the app was helpful to find rides we enjoyed the shows and we ended up staying til close ,5,2018-04-03
2959,Exceeded our expectations,wonderful time had at disneyland arrived at the park early and got through the entrance and security check relatively quick highly recommend the fast pass system managed to get to all the busy rides twice throughout the day with no more than a min wait ,5,2018-04-03
2960,"When in Cali, you must do Disneyland!",yes it is super expensive to get in yes there are way too many people in the park yes it costs and arm and legs to eat inside the park but do it at least once in your life especially if you are a kid at heart or in my case have been coming here since you were a kid i ve seen a lot of changes since i first set foot in the park when i was a little one but that s what happens when something becomes as huge and successful as disneyland has in the past few years true it was more fun to go when i was little and the lines didn t take hours to get on a ride but it is still worth seeing if you plan on taking the family which you should do i suggest you start saving your money a few years ahead of time especially if you don t make a lot of money like me it is a lot of fun if you go on the off months on a week day i don t suggest going in the summer ,5,2018-04-03
2961,Magical Place,i grew up going to disneyland now that i m an adult i still go whenever i can with my annual pass i always have a great time when i go i never outgrow my love for disneyland the place is just truly magical ,5,2018-04-03
2962,Maintains the Spirit of Walt,i have not been to disneyland for years but now blessed with grandchildren the opportunity was presented to roll back the clock this is a very special place despite the crowds and long line ups it is a lifetime bucket list must see ,5,2018-04-03
2963,"Have Graandkids, Will Visit",i took my kids to disneyland park years ago and now relived the fun by taking my grandchild you should visit with a child to really see the wonder through their eyes food is expensive and the wait for favorite rides can be tedious even with pre scheduled times but it s disney so who s complaining stay on property to really get the most out of your visit ,4,2018-04-03
2964,fast pass is a must,rides still looking the same since the firts time that i visit disneyland they charge almost for water,4,2018-04-02
2965,Disney 2018,very busy time to travel park was shoulder to shoulder still a good experience it felt like disney staff was as always friendly and accommodating ,5,2018-04-02
2966,Love for Disney is strong with this one!,what can be said about disneyland that hasn t been said more eloquently by many others not much but i will say as a new grandmother coming here with my son four two year old granddaughters was better than i could ever convey as i come here with friends my age we seldom go on kid s rides so going on them for the first time in years king arthur s carousel for instance was really fun toontown winnie the pooh also get mentions here cause i literally never go there great time beautifully the spring and a day i ll remember the rest of my life ,5,2018-04-02
2967,Happiest place by far,went two days before easter and expected huge crowds but it was all very manageable and enjoyable did the dine and ticket plan for fantasmic worth it ,5,2018-04-02
2968,Vacation 2018,lots of things to do for all ages my grandson loved meeting all his pals from mickey mouse clubhouse plan for lines if you go during peak hours ,4,2018-04-02
2969,Missed the one ride we wanted,the thunder mtn railroad was closed the day we were there which was disappointing as we heard it was the best space mountain was too violent no scenery too loud we couldn t have done without the fast pass ,4,2018-04-02
2970,It's a happy place :),i had only been to disneyworld orlando and so disneyland anaheim was a first for myself and our two young children and what a blast we had husband myself yo mo clean organized pleasant employees and great attractions certainly worth visiting the disney california adventure as well less magic but more fun ,5,2018-04-02
2971,Best time ever.,we had a great time at disneyland we went on easter so it was busy from about noon through pm but that s about it great times great staff great everything truly the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-04-02
2972,Really? Review Disneyland? Ok,if you haven t been you should go at least once it will cost a lot and you may be stressed from crowds and wait times but with good planning you can minimize those aspects don t read the reviews if you have an opportunity to go then go at least once in your life it s iconic ,4,2018-04-02
2973,Love ❤️❤️❤️❤️,i grew up going to disneyland as well as my kids the park is clean and beautiful and safe it s magical it s our family s favorite place to be we have an annual pass we come down from portland often ,5,2018-04-02
2974,Disneyland Dizzy Land advice,planning a disney trip can be overwhelming how ever unplanned can be disastrous plan well ahead do not just show up and hope for the best people doing that leave unhappy if you stay off site use art anahime rapid transit it is affordable convenient and has a usable app save your feet for the park go early am there is a security screening use the disney app for navigation and fast pass we took in over most popular rides in one and a half days we found the staff to be helpful and friendly we found people with strollers to be rude and unpleasant they often used the stroller as a tool to force their way through the crowds they jammed up walk ways and isles in shops children under years of age are not going to full enjoy the disney experience leave the stroller and the tinny ones at home disneyland will be more fun for both child and parent when they are a little older ,4,2018-04-01
2975,Fantastic third trip to Disneyland!,we went to disneyland with a day pass the weather was cloudy and it rained one day but we had the best time anyway rainy days at disneyland are the best no lineups and cool weather just bring a raincoat or an umbrella maybe a cloth or napkins to dry off seats such a great time ,5,2018-04-01
2976,Saw both sides of the park over a three day period,lots of fun for two older adults reliving their childhood adventures in disneyland although two rides were inoperative we were able to catch them during our stay without any difficulty enjoyed the changes that have been recently added ,5,2018-04-01
2977,Love disney,just returned from a fun trip to disneyland had a great time hitting the rides and shows was a bit crowded but still able to do all we wanted the max pass was definitely worth the price ,5,2018-04-01
2978,never gets old,although we would like to se some updates to this park it is great for younger people but is always busy but it never gets old as we always have fun ,5,2018-04-01
2979,Spring Break Trip, day visit is always fun crowded but that s expected we were able to walk on to several rides early in the day but by noon lines were min long ,5,2018-04-01
2980,I <3 Disneyland,i love disneyland from when i was a kid this place was a magical destination that i d get to experience every few years i think as a teen young adult i ve come even more than when i was a kid anyway it s really what you make out of it it s gonna be crowded the lines are gonna be long the screaming kids and jerk parents will really test your limits but just go and experience the magic of disney ,5,2018-04-01
2981,Happiest place on earth......,so it took us a long journey to get to this place our girl was diagnosed with leukaemia back in at the tender age of yo and we promised when she finished treatment we would take her to the happiest place on earth well most of the staff were grumpy the evil queen and pluto made up for it they played their character exceptionally you certainly need days to get around and even then we missed parts highly recommend the fireworks didnt get to see the parade as it was cancelled highly recommend astro orbitor mark twain riverboat sailing ship columbia blue bayou restaurant big thunder mountain railroad and matterhorn bobsleds although this ride is very riggetty and not great if you have a back issue it was fun to see the characters although got a little over having to que on day mikey made a fuss which was awesome and even hugged our girls pink seahorse called snugglebum whom has been by her side through treatment now that brought a tear loved disneyland railroad and tarzans treehouse i guess the expectation was too high and in parts was disappointing maybe a little overwhelming too the amount of people didnt really bother us and it was great to people watch wish it could have been more ,3,2018-03-31
2982,Disney - Max Pass - Spring Break,visited both disneyland and california adventure over two days when breaking down the cost per person per day for two there parks is a very competitive price we took advantage of the maxpass per person per day which allowed us unlimited photos and to reserve our fast pass tickets from our phone this meant that we could use our fast pass and book out next ride without having to physically swipe our park ticket at the fast pass collection also meant that we could be back at our hotel and still reserving rides once every minutes for the night end result was we were able to ride space mountain buzz lightyear cars and guardians all at night without having to wait in any lines cast members are all super friendly and very helpful park is spotless considering spring break the lines were not too long to line between hour was to be expected all in all this was a great time and would return ,5,2018-03-31
2983,Disney Knows How to Amaze!,we have been taking our two daughters to disneyland annually for the past few years and it gets better every time the new max pass systems is a great way to avoid the lines there seemed to be more construction than usual this past trip but it was still magical ,5,2018-03-31
2984,Love everything about this place,this was my second visit and my sister and her families first it lived up to everything remembered about it and is truely a magical place the rides are amazing and so well thought out most rides definitely make you feel like you re in another world my highlights were space mountain pirates of the caribbean and the fantasmic water and light show truly awesome some tips we learned download a game like heads up for the long queues they can get a bit much for an adult let alone a year old without something to occupy your time plan when you go the weekend we went is historically one of the quietest of the year and it definitely reflected that compared to when i last went plan your visit use fast pass where possible eat outside of disney or downtown disney the food will be cheaper and healthier basically just love it for the magic it is definitely my happiest place on earth ,5,2018-03-31
2985,Max Pass? Yes!,crowded yes i mean very very crowded as always however the price is still worth it the new max pass is a must if you intend to go on any of the popular rides ,5,2018-03-31
2986,Nobody does atmosphere like Disney,disneyland is a wonderfully fun park you enter by the train station and start walking up the main street toward the disney castle there are stores and attractions lining both sides of the streets you can see abe lincoln and watch six early disney cartoons in a theater there are all of the old favorites matterhorn space mountain the haunted house pirates of the carribean thunder mountain and some new rides like indiana jones each area is themed and nobody does atmosphere like disney it s best to use maxpass this is an app used with your phone that you can use to make fastpass reservations it s per ticket per day but well worth it you can have more than one fastpass at a time with maxpass and you don t have to be at the ride to reserve a time ,4,2018-03-31
2987,Good fun had by all,such a great experience for the whole family the maxpass is great app to have if you get pictures seemed too much money for the fast pass options however being from canada and not having access to wifi made it more costly to use anyway all in all always a pleasure ,5,2018-03-31
2988,"Too busy, too crowded, Mobile FastPass Costs Extra ...",we took our and years old to disneyland and had an ok time it was very crowded but thankfully lineups for the children s rides were manageable the merry go round pinocchio storybrook boat ride jungle cruise and even casey s circus train had short waits autopia had a manageable minute wait it was only the higher end rides like star tours and other tomorrowland rides that were to minutes experience was typical for a disney park food was passable mostly edible still what i don t like about disneyland is that you re charged for mobile fastpass as far as i m aware mobile fastpass is free in florida but disney charges per day per person for the privilege to book rides on a mobile app this i think is unacceptable mobile booking should be a complimentary convenience considering the price of the tickets because of the fact disney charges extra for mobile booking we won t be going back to disneyland park and instead sticking with florida maybe that s their evil plan after all to alleviate crowding ,3,2018-03-31
2989,Highly enjoyable family trip,all stars all everything all the time do not wait to take your family this is a must go attraction ticket prices may seem steep but well worth it parking is bringing your own drinks and snacks is allowed use the fast pass tickets as much as possible get the fantasmic show tickets early morning near the mark twain river boat use the disneyland app to maximize your time in the park it will usually take days to do all attractions utilize magic morning if possible to get in a few extra rides ,5,2018-03-31
2990,Hugely overrated - don't do it,we three adults and four kids aged visited the disneyland park march th after a long day in lines and only finishing five rides even with the max pass app we left tired and disappointed there is very few things that remind the kids of being in disneyland at all luckily we got to see the beauty and the beast in the fantasyland the rides are outdated and the lines horrible and anything but using the fast pass system unbearable be prepared to navigate between thousands of strollers with kids way past toddlers are american kids so lazy the cannot walk any longer don t do it even if it s on your california adventure bucket list it s not worth it money or time wise spend your money somewhere else ,1,2018-03-31
2991,Visit to Mickey's Kingdom,an amazing and mesmerizing place like no other one of the parks where once can spend the entire day from am pm enjoying a bagful of exciting engagements amazing visualization and great food you have plenty of options its expensive everything so plan yourself well rest amazing must visit for kids a wonderful experience,4,2018-03-31
2992,California Adventure Park,my husband had a small soft bouncy ball my son had and was playing with prior to our departure from our resort before we boarded the shuttle to pass time we took this into the park times before the last time security took it out of my husbands backpack and said we had to surrender it or take it to the car because we took the shuttle the car wasn t an option the security officer then went on to say that if we were caught in the park with a ball we could be escorted out of the park my son was so upset over this he had just gotten that ball when we arrived in california keep in mind disney sells balls very similar to the one my son brought in it just didn t have a mickey face on it i was told that the reason they allow sales and possession of these same types of balls in the park was because they ve been checked over my son had not once taken that ball out of my husbands bag he just had it to play with prior to us arriving to disneyland the chamber of commerce cast member did absolutely nothing with my complaint the only person who truly cared was a cast member named nina who was working in the guardians area on the night we were there thank god she was working because she gave us a voucher for my son to use to replace the ball that was taken from him she was kind and sweet and let me vent my frustrations about our experience with disney she was wonderful she was the positive light in our day when we were leaving the park we were told by the security officers that the bin this is where they put all of the items they confiscate from their guests is essentially off limits and will not be available for guests nor will they hold the item they take to be picked up at the end of the day when i asked where they take all of the toys they take from these kids i was told the trash compactor can you believe this a billion dollar company not even willing to donate the items they ve wrongly taken what is a small bouncy ball going to do disney i can see if it was out and being played with or causing disruption but to take it because it s considered sporting equipment they have listed on their prohibited items online things like helmets baseball bats hockey sticks no where does it say bouncy balls come on disney unbelievable you won t have to worry about escorting my family out of your park we won t be back also half of their rides at california adventure park are being repaired or maintenanced so just be aware of that when you go as well if a ride breaks down and guests had a fast pass to that ride they ll allow them to choose another ride which is nice but not necessarily fair to the other guests who had a fastpass to the line with a ride working so we waited minutes to get on our fast pass ride this situation went far beyond the ball we got my son another one it s the principle we were treated as though we brought in a weapon and then told this weapon we brought was going in the bin and then to the trash with all of the other innocent not harmful items taken from kids i appreciate security and what they do to keep everyone safe i truly do i respect their efforts however this was asinine and uncalled for this was the item security found to be a threat and dangerous enough to get you escorted out of their park be on the lookout for these balls when you go and by all means do not bring them to the park unless you want a heartbroken child and it put in the bin they are hazardous and prohibited terrifying little thing isn t it ,2,2018-03-31
2993,Loved It!,all of the photopass photographers in this park were great actually all of the cast members were terrific they were very accommodating to the kids in our party especially my little brother with special needs there was a vendor selling popcorn who was very sweet the lines were long but it was not too bad since the wait was not in sweltering heat the fireworks were unfortunately canceled during the night we were there however the light show was still pretty nice since this park closes at midnight it made an even better experience we squeezed in as many activities in one day as we could ,5,2018-03-30
2994,Trip with family and grandpa in a wheelchair,we had a group of including my wheelchair bound father they told us where all the wheelchair accessible rides were and were very helpful the kids loved the launch bay and seeing all the star wars characters we spent hours there a very full day ,5,2018-03-30
2995,Holy Crap its getting expensive,we have been to disneyland a couple times but holy crap has it become expensive once you are in the park the cost of feeding our kids was so high we could have spent a week at an allinclusive resort for less money the rides were fun the lines were long the place was clean and not even as busy as we expected but the prices just have turned us off and we likely wont return again in the future ,3,2018-03-30
2996,great fun!!,this is a smaller version of disneyland florida many say it is the perfect size that being said it is still very very large and has anything and everything that any child or adult can have fun doing and you don t have to worry too much about rain well worth a visit ,5,2018-03-30
2997,Great theme park,it s disney what more is there to say no body does it the way they do perfect park for all ages great food shopping and entertainment a must do ,5,2018-03-30
2998,Happiest place on earth for the 1 percent,i love disneyland and have had season pass for years now but with the recently raised price for the season disneyland is no longer worth it ,3,2018-03-30
2999,Not the Disneyland Way,i am really disappointed hour long lines for the popular rides is way too long the early passes don t work when so many hotels offer them even early admission the lines were min plus for the popular rides spending your vacation standing in lines even for the woman s restrooms is not my idea of vacation we wanted to see the frozen show you can t reserve or hold seats your whole party has to be with you which means standing in another line for min or so with nothing but cement to play and sit on i don t want to boar with every detail but everywhere we went we got different answers from staff no clear picture of how to do things example the stroller we rented one person said we could take it to the hotel it just had to be back before they closed another walking out of the park said we could not take it we had to leave it at the gate and take the tag out of it and it will be there when we get back when we got back a few hours later it was gone and all the other stroller rentals still had their tags on them so we got another stroller went on our way stood in line for another ride came back the stroller was gone got another stroller stood in line again for another ride an hour and forty five minutes later the stroller was moved this time into a stroller parking with other rented strollers in the dark minutes later we found it my biggest gripe with disneyland is their light show procedures you go early like am to get your ticket to the light show at pm we got in line about pm to go in there was already a ton of people there they pushed us into a tiny area called the holding area very few places to sit and nothing but cement for the kids to play on about they released us to the viewing area where people were pushing and rude you know who you are and karma wii get you someday to get to a front row viewing area it s all lined off with rope and people were going over the ropes and merging with everyone else it s like being in a mosh pit no where to sit standing viewing only waiting another minutes for the show to start i read if you brought a blanket to sit on you could set up in a grassy area and sit and watch the light show it was so wrong there is no grass left in this place this place is not magical it does not feel like the disneyland way metal detectors and purse searches fast passes and disneyland hotel price gouging i was standing in line to get through security and the security officer was telling me they are adding yet another disneyland hotel where rainforest cafe is so they can get more money from more people and add even more waiting time greedy dogs i know i will never go back to disneyland the experience is ruined forever for me ,2,2018-03-30
3000,In Love,i have been going to disneyland since i was a baby i will never stop going here each land from fantasyland adventureland frontierland to tomorrowland cast members help transport you to whatever land you are in and help you feel right at home on main street the shops have a wide variety of souvenir options for those you love or for yourself i love disneyland and i will go there until it is physically impossible for me to go back ,5,2018-03-30
3001,Happiest Place on Earth,we had a blast we re a family of all of our kids had a blast crowds weren t that bad staff was great ,5,2018-03-29
3002,Line ups too long to get in to the park,the line ups were to long to get in to the park there should be a separate line for returning pass holders since they just get scanned and can go through people entering the park for the first time and needs to get their pass should be in a separate line currently if you pick the wrong line and everyone in front of you are st time people it takes an extremely long time to get in ,3,2018-03-29
3003,Yooooo this was lit,yo forreal this was a bomb place to visit with the boiz all of us had a lit time at this place anyone who reviewed this under stars should get lost cause they don t know what they talkin about you no ,5,2018-03-28
3004,"Fantastic, happiest place on Earth",fantastic wonderful love disneyland tips go early as you have to line up for security and tickets buy an early entry ticket go on big rides asap buy a park hopper ticket if you have time do at least days buy a fast pass can t wait to go back ,5,2018-03-28
3005,I think everyone knows How amazing this is…,amazing rides so fun and family friendly i would go there any day why not it s amazing it is expensive but if you get a disneyland hotel you get access to the rides an hour before everyone else meaning there are way less lines go to disneyland ,5,2018-03-28
3006,"Had a great time, even in the rain!",we decided to take in disneyland for a midweek getaway without of kids so we could enjoy the happiest place on earth as adults we had a great time even in the rain as the atmospheric river was coming in according to the weather channel the rides didn t disappoint and neither did the hospitality everyone was very friendly ,5,2018-03-27
3007,Mediocre,lines are way too long for the quality of ride experience you get daily price on a ticket is the same cost as a season pass at a theme park in my state i m sure kids think it s great but probably not for a parents bank account they really need to figure out the overcrowded feeling you get the entire time great pineapple ice cream though ,2,2018-03-26
3008,We look forward to going every year!,make sure you make reservations ahead of time if you plan on having a nice dinner at the park yelp has ratings for all the restaurants we went with my brothers family and worked it out so some of us stayed in line while two people were sent out to get fast pass tickets for other rides you can always say you were using the bathroom and your family is saving your spot in line also get your tickets for less at tickettorides com we save on tickets to all the parks from this website ,5,2018-03-26
3009,Had a good time,we spent a couple of days hopping between the parks would fully recommend the early opening you can get on certain days when you book online for that hour we must have done rides that you would normally have to wait a minimum of mins also the early part of the day is the best time to get your fast passes as the park seems to start getting really busy after pm fantasmic was good as were the fireworks ,4,2018-03-26
3010,Disneyland Park,too many people but still fun use the fast passes they make life easier get the disneyland app it is very helpful the fireworks are incredible and so is the fantastic show ,4,2018-03-26
3011,Happiest place on Earth,who can t not love love love disneyland yes lots and lots and lots of people but my goodness you can t wipe the smile of ones face when there the rides are just super great and although lining up can be a little tedious it s just so worth it i would recommend getting a fast pass for your favourite ride but not all of the rides it will work out to be very expensive if you do this take your time to walk around plenty of places to grab a cold drink or a bite to eat a definite to stay for the fireworks just a magical place to be from to everyone loves disneyland photos with the characters are timed but happen on and off throughout the day around the park ,5,2018-03-26
3012,Friendly and Accomodating,i travelled with my mom and my two teenage girls every morning we rented a wheel chair for my mom to easily get around the park as walking long distances is challenging for her the staff at the rental site were friendly kind and accommodating it was wonderful to leave the chair at the park while we walked back to the hotel for an afternoon rest and pick up the chair when we returned the disney cast members were always so very helpful and accommodating the grounds were impeccable and everyone was willing to help with any question we had what an amazing experience the staff was helpful kind knowledgeable and funny ,5,2018-03-26
3013,Wonderful place to visit,we visited here in march started our day at california adventure park and arrived in disneyland in the afternoon crowds were moderate and people were very polite temps were in the upper s having only day in this park is not enough we could have easily spent a few days here ,5,2018-03-26
3014,Still the best,lots of people and lots of fun my age baby said this was the best vacation ever the food is pricey but the pirates haunted house casey jr etc are still fun experiences for old and young folks ,5,2018-03-26
3015,My life at Disneyland,i visited disneyland the first time during the first year it was opened and i have been back each year ever since when it opened i was living in san diego since then i have moved to virginia but since i have relatives who live in san diego and lafayette i visit each year in the summer disneyland has always been a clean and well operated park at the beginning things seemed more relaxed and welcoming lately it seems to have turned into a frantic overcrowded experience many of the old rides and shows that you could easily enjoy and get on without endless lines are gone such as the people mover carousel of progress and others also lines are too long and line jumping is rampant and the people who work there don t seem to care about that very much in general the park has lost a lot of its old charm and attractiveness when my mother was alive she would like to spend a week visiting the park but i doubt if she would want to do that now ,4,2018-03-26
3016,Vacation,nice park i would say over priced firework display was beautiful at least both parks had a starbucks that is a huge plus ,4,2018-03-25
3017,Disneyland Awesomeness!,we had so much fun at disney for my grandson s birthday even though it was raining disney still made it a special place to be the crowds were smaller and the lines were shorter which made it a great day ,5,2018-03-25
3018,Disney World fans enjoy our Disneyland Park adventure,our family loves all things disney disneyland did not disappoint guardians of the galaxy most fun ride ever as fun as tower of terror is the guardians of the galaxy renovation to the ride improved it tenfold disneyland food is much better than disney world i personally think disney world rides are better except for guradians of the galaxy and i really miss the parades but it was still a very magical experience we will visit again ,5,2018-03-25
3019,I’m sure this is not what Walt Disney had in mind.,we booked knowing it was spring break and lines would be long but looked forward to visiting the original disneyland we were blown away at how the disney has been taken out of this park it s pretty close to just your average rundown old amusement park bus loads and i mean bus loads of unsupervised and disrespectful teenagers run rampant through the park we spent several hours between groups in lines for the attractions and watched them ignore every sign to stay off etc these signs acted like a dare to them so here is the other problem fast passes and lines once you scan your fast pass the line often parallels the regular line more than once we saw groups jumping a measly road to skip the regular line disney needs to put a second check station in to prevent the line jumpers only space mountain has this second check and you should have see the kids and even adults getting kicked out of the line lines for food lines for bathrooms lines for rides lines for the security check worse than and longer than the airport disney staff so rude that i wonder how they got a job ok i d be a little mad after dealing with the teenagers i just described but tried to give them a bad day break glad to say we saw the original again but will go to world for the disney experience ps fastpass everything you can including all the night shows in all the parks sometimes it s still not the best view but better than no view ,2,2018-03-25
3020,Happiest place on earth!,we love the park and it is always a great adventure each time place is always clean and the employees are over the top nice and courteous it makes the day relaxing and comfortable makes dealing with the crowds easier we are season pass holders and visit several times a year worth the money ,5,2018-03-25
3021,It’s the happiest place on earth,not really but it is fun for a day or two what can i say it s disneyland definitely fast track when you go more of the park was closed than i expected ,5,2018-03-25
3022,Not near as good as Magic Kingdom,visiting disneyland after many trips to disney world in orlando made this park seem like a carnival in comparison the rides were old and rickety and the park is so crowded and miserable definitely not how i remembered it as a child considering the traffic in la from the airport and the general atmosphere of the city i definitely won t be going back anytime soon if i can manage it california adventure is better but not by much go to florida instead for a better experience ,3,2018-03-25
3023,4 days at Disney,spent days here days in each of the parks personally i still prefer the orlando one but love the cars land here ,5,2018-03-25
3024,Have a magical day!,this was what it felt like when we were visiting disneyland disney works very hard at making sure you have a magical experience if you haven t heard there is a way to get on the rides fast called fast pass it is only for the most popular rides the way it works is that you go to the fast pass kiosk near the ride use your park pass to get the fast pass it will give you a hour time frame to return to the ride and get in the shorter lane a tip we learned was that you can t get another fast pass until the current fast pass time frame begins what we stared to do was once the current fast pass time started we went to the next ride we wanted to ride and got that fast pass then went and rode the current ride fast pass another tip is that as the day goes on the fast passes can run out so get them early we also found out that the wait times can be exaggerated the wait time was hours but it only took one hour our favorite ride in disneyland was indiana jones don t forget to indulge in a churo or the pretzel twists are also very tasty enjoy your magical day ,5,2018-03-25
3025,Not the happiest place on earth.,the lines for the rides were too long my year old twins did not want to ride after standing in line for so long too many people it is not the happiest place on earth the food was over priced and not that good at all people were rude including staff very disappointed and the price for the park was too high rides were not that great i recommend pirates and indiana jones and space mountain give yourself at least to days to get through park the bathrooms in new orleans square were gross go to the winnie the pooh bathrooms they are cleaner and do not have as many people we went on a friday but we were told to go during the week when lines were not that bad ,1,2018-03-25
3026,Go early in the morning!,my husband and i came here on our honeymoon and we got a special badge that said happily ever after and everyone said congratulations even other guests how awesome we got there at am and the wait times for the rides was very low so we managed to get the popular ones out of the way and enjoy everything else disney has to offer we met characters and enjoyed some shopping it was a shame they were doing maintenance so we couldn t go on splash mountain my favourite ride food is expensive and luckily there is water fountains around however they need some that you can fill your drink bottle up with for when you are waiting in lines we left the park in the afternoon and came back for fantasmic and the fireworks i was unaware you could get fast passes for fantasmic and was a bit disappointed when everyone who didn t have one got sent around the sides for viewing and the prime positions were for fast pass people anyway fantasmic was absolutely amazing i was blown away fantasmic finished at and the fireworks started at lucky they had a viewing from the fantasmic area however some of the fireworks were blocked by the large trees such a shame overall we really enjoyed our experience here afterall it is the happiest place on earth ,4,2018-03-24
3027,Disney & California Adventure,if you are planning on visiting disney land never ever go during spring break in march the average waiting time for the rides ranged from min to hours all day every day night also several rides were closed due to scheduled maintenance which are mostly done in march as well but they don t tell you about it and you still have to pay full price per ticket ,2,2018-03-24
3028,Going down,i was not happy with my recent trip to disneyland the food is very expensive and not very good many cast members are only average talking about their personal life on the job pirates and haunted mansion have gone dark not disney anymore peter pan has been remade into a cheesy imitation of the former ride i ve been coming to disneyland for years and probably won t go back again this is not what walt disney intended for disneyland and is probably very unhappy about what s happening there now ,3,2018-03-24
3029,Disneyland Park,this is the original park i absolutely love this park now it has its similarity as disney world but this park has its own originality nice and clean and you must have a fast pass this helps you move around quickly ,5,2018-03-24
3030,What's not to love?,disneyland vacation was fun for the family used fast passes and made the most of early morning magic made great memories ,5,2018-03-24
3031,A classic,we found a day pass to be adequate for a group with toddlers park is very clean lines were not overly long don t forget fast pass plenty of restrooms enjoyed breakfast with minnie be sure to reserve in advance the nite shows were spectacular definitely advise an afternoon break for your group the cast members were outstanding very patient with the little ones and generous with greetings hugs autographs and photo ops in the end the kids favorite things were king arthur s carousel and meeting the princesses mickey minnie ,5,2018-03-24
3032,Disneyland with no kids,this is the first time in years we have visited disneyland without children we had a great time the park is a different experience when you are not trying to get on every ride we wonder through shops took time to take in the details that make this special and of course rode our favorite rides ,4,2018-03-24
3033,Great time,we came here with our year old it was great because there was not even a handful of rides that he wasn t tall enough for he even tried space mountain definitely worth the trip and imo much easier to take a year old here rather then to florida he loved seeing all the characters and everyone was very pleasant funny helpful and it was all in all a wonderful time for all of us ,5,2018-03-24
3034,Starting to show its age,starting to show its age but still very much a destination for families couples groups whatever unfortunately there was no main street parade or fireworks when i went which made me sad it was kind of like going to wally world ,3,2018-03-23
3035,Not as expected,the main reason of our trip to california was my ex and i was taking our year old to disneyland california adventures getting to an actual parking spot was interesting and a good half hour we started off at california adventures because i guess it closed earlier and he bought the maxpass i felt like it was a waste because we had maybe one photo taken of us we might as well just of gotten the fastpass the lines were short though so that was very nice we only rode maybe a total of under rides between the two parks i was happy being plus size i could ride most the rides with my daughter the parks themselves felt packed it got crowded fast i m not sure if they were doing some kind of construction but they had the middle where all the shops are as you enter blocked off our daughter only got to get pictures with three characters i can understand especially since that day was pretty warm they can t be out long we didn t see any face characters before we left she got to see minnie mouse it was funny seeing a small line form as they walked until they reached their spot i told her and her dad to jump in the line before it got too long we were disappointed the souvenir cups didn t have some kind of refill system we re use to king s island and the columbus zoo here in ohio you get free refills the day of purchase and a drink after here no one would fill our cup so we just got waters and dumped them in there i tried asking the cashier lady if anywhere else filled them up about it and she rudely just repeated while you are eating here you can refill your cup if you come back later it s we stopped into several other eating establishments and none of them would fill it we had to buy a drink once it got close to evening both our phones were dying i saw some kind of charging lockers on the map and read maybe old reviews so we went searching for them there was a guy loading the rechargeable battery dispenser who told us they no longer have those and haven t for years so my ex ended up buying one of those for since you can change it anywhere within minutes we had to exchange it because it wasn t charging his phone to his liking it was nice we actually saw one at an airport so we re not limited to just disneyland or disney world it would be nice if they had some kind of buy back program if you didn t want to keep it you d at least get half your money back or something once returned the merchandise was expensive as expected i waited until the end of the day to buy her minnie ears so it wouldn t get destroyed i ended up making a return which was nice because the embroidery shop that does baseball caps said our items wouldn t be ready until almost closing but we were tired by pm and just wanted to go back to our hotel we were going to watch fantasmic at disneyland but everywhere we stood we had workers saying we had to move because it s reserved we didn t know we could of reserved a spot earlier in the day there was at least one nice gentlemen who came up and asked any questions we had and explained it to us he tried to sit where there were tables and another worker had a rude attitude about it could of said i m sorry sir these are reserved seats another thing was the popcorn bucket my ex wanted to refill it before we left but they don t do that either we just had to buy a box and dump it i was standing off to the side of the concession and one of the workers was blocking off an area and told another she s in the way i turn around and i was like wth she roped me in a little boxed off area i had to go under the rope could of nicely asked me to move to let me know i was in the way at that point he was in a bad mood and just wanted to get out of here we were going to go back when our youngest daughter gets about but decided we d rather go to disneyworld ,3,2018-03-23
3036,Didn’t regret spending Christmas break here!!,this was a place of my childhood and i went again with my friends from minnesota and we definitely enjoyed it and a lot of super fun activities rides and sightseeing ,5,2018-03-23
3037,great family experience,there is something for everyone at disney and if you can take your time you will enjoy it even more our day park hopper passes plus daily max passes allowed enough time to see pretty much everything we wanted but definitely not everything the staff do a truly incredible job and the attention to detail is amazing for adults and one child we spent a solid each day on food but there are more affordable options outside of the park plan for a rest day after a day or two at the parks and for the love of god wear your most comfortable shoes cheers ,5,2018-03-22
3038,A definite destination,disney does things right it is easy to get to even on busy days people get moved around and wait times are usually less than advertised all of your favourites are here including lots of star wars the cool thing about disney is whatever the age there is a ride and attraction for you it continues to be the ultimate family attraction ,4,2018-03-22
3039,love this place,happiness is all around you in here joy love and just plain fun the imagination is allowed to run wild and there are no limits to new and wonderful things to discover,5,2018-03-22
3040,Our first visit to Disneyland,it was a seven member family vacation although the park is much smaller than disney world which we visit all the time since we live on the east coast it was just as much fun and i loved the indiana jones ride which we do not have at disney world very glad we decided to give disneyland a visit just a few differences that gave it a unique experience it is amazing to see this attraction sitting in the middle of the city ,5,2018-03-22
3041,Our vacation,we loved going to our happiest place on earth we visit at least times a year and love the calm we feel when we are there ,5,2018-03-22
3042,Mickey at Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln,usually to see mickey mouse you wait minutes to see him for minutes before leaving the park at pm we went to see great moments with mr lincoln and mickey mouse was hanging out in the lobby with no one around we got to spend some good quality time with the mouse before the lincoln show and didn t feel rushed to hurry up because of other park guests it was a great surprise and fun way to end our trip to disneyland ,5,2018-03-22
3043,Magical,an absolute dream it was everything we imagined more we spent days here as a family with our children aged they were never without a smile on their faces must try the churros they were our favourite highly recommend max pass so much larger than we expected we walked over kms our first day in the park so make sure you have great shoes epsom salts to soak your feet in afterwards can t wait to return one day ,5,2018-03-22
3044,Family Fun,we always love disneyland it is a great place to get away from everyday troubles and enjoy time with the family ,5,2018-03-22
3045,Annual Pass Holders,needless to say we love this place since we have been annual pass holders for more than years there is a trend in other amusement parks that will already started at disneyland park visitors can now pay extra to be able to get fast passes online it is convenient but it s just another thing that you have to spend your hard earned money on oh well they have to pay for star wars land pixar land and marvel land somehow ,4,2018-03-21
3046,Awesome,we had a fantastic time at disneyland we could not have asked for a better vacation even during spring break the crowds weren t too bad thank you for the memories ,5,2018-03-21
3047,Dreams Come True,make sure you bring your walking shoes and are set to have an amazing time my year old husband and i had a blast spending days here during our honeymoon it was everything i ever dreamed it to be and more the fast pass system was great and as our timing was not during peak season we had hardly any lines we were sad that the fireworks did not operate during the time we chose to go and weren t aware of this until we asked a staff member towards the end of the day park was extremely clean and staff all very friendly and helpful can t wait to return ,5,2018-03-20
3048,Childhood dream come true,came here from australia for our honeymoon for the soul purpose of going to disneyland and i was not disappointed the rides the food the merch and the characters were all amazing i wish i had more time there and wore better shoes ,5,2018-03-20
3049,Under construction,i think we were there at the wrong time many ride were closed then too major rides kept breaking down which meant the other rides were crowded and the lines were longer very frustrating at one point we were thinking of asking for a refund ,3,2018-03-20
3050,Fun and relaxing!,if you have never been to disneyland you are in for a treat my first visit was the year or two after the park opened which was this latest visit was fantastic every time we come it is always a fun and joyful time be open to the many different rides and adventures ,5,2018-03-20
3051,Dreams come true,what can i say the kids loved it there a lot of rides here that are for small children and some of the hyped rides are disappointing be prepared to wait in long lines the fast pass is great don t forget about it i think the best option to go all the wanted rides either very early in the morning or late at night ,5,2018-03-20
3052,Happiest Place on Earth!,such a fun time at disneyland with the family something fun for everyone we were happy pirates was open this year but sadly splash mountain is closed love the new fast pass and max fast pass system it is so nice to just have the fp on your ticket and not have to worry about the little slips of paper and when a ride we had a fp for was down they turn it into a universal fp right on your ticket so you can go on any fp ride it s nice that they let you bring food in now we saved a lot not paying their high food prices but you must have the dole whip great place for young and old disney truly is the happiest place on earth ,5,2018-03-19
3053,Always Magical 🏰,we were there on sunday and it was not crowded i was worried it would be packed due to spring break cannot stress enough that the fast pass max pass is worth every penny also the disney app is awesome for tracking wait times passes pictures love it and it seems like they have improved it as it didn t crash or drain my battery this time ,5,2018-03-19
3054,DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME,not up to par as far as disney standards go cast members were rude and the park was overall dirty the lines were very long even the fast pass lines i was with people with disabilities and disney was not very accommodating at all it was a lot of money for nothing exciting disney world does it right spend your time and money there disneyland was a joke when i asked for my money back i was refused one cast member even referred to disabled people as those kind of people i cant express enough how disappointed everyone was will never go back and sorry we went in there in the first place ,2,2018-03-19
3055,Disappointed change to Fast Pass at DL,we booked the day multi park pass and in the past you could scan your ticket for a fast pass at each park this is not the case anymore once you scan your pass for a fast pass your locked out for a max of two hours or the time stamp on your fp whichever comes first i suggest opting for a one park each day pass and save the extra fee of the multi park pass ,2,2018-03-19
3056,The World of Color dessert party was a disaster.,this review pertains to the world of color dessert party at california adventure but everything seems to be grouped under disneyland here this event was terrible now yes part of it was the circumstances it had been raining a heavy pour all day and we were expecting the show to be cancelled it was not instead we got to sit in wet chairs at soaking wet tables that a cast member could not even be be bothered to wipe a towel across we were given a plastic lunchbox filled with desserts half of which were stale cheeses and bread sticks we were offered several alcoholic drinks and chose a vodka concoction which tasted like juicy juice mixed with sprite so we asked for the sparkling wine next and it was alright but when we asked for a second glass we were told guests were limited to two drinks two drinks for the price i had paid a head each of should have received an entire bottle of wine the show itself was no better than the bellagio fountains and since we were freezing wet and tired we left early just walked out later writing a letter to disneyland about our experience and actually receiving all of our money back clearly they must have understood something was not right with the way they were going i would not recommend this event for anyone plenty of room was available in the general admission area avoid ,1,2018-03-19
3057,Feel like a kid again!,what can i say greatest place on earth even for adults there s so much to do here i do recommend that you visit rides ahead of time and get a fastpass this tells you what time to come back so saves time in lines can easily spend a whole day here and only see half the park wear comfy shoes plenty of places to buy food and drinks we also used the disney app to help find our way around i also recommend buying a park hopper pass as this allows you to move back and fourth between disneyland and california adventure ,5,2018-03-19
3058,Money money money with little value,this is our rd disney park and my god was we disappointed i can honestly see how in they made billion in profits from there parks they sell happiness but do they sell it at a reasonable price god no single banana plus tax small bottle of water plus tax walling round this park looking a the to hour plus lines i thought to myself why am i here is it for the top rides in the world no is it for the amazing treatment from there cast no i actually couldn t give myself a good enough reason there food is mediocre for a high price there rides are not the best in the industry there is no real value in a disney park save some money and take the kids to parks that s invest because they want you to be happy and enjoy not just because they want to rinse you for supply the so called happiest place on earth ,1,2018-03-18
3059,Great Day at Disney,my wife and i are a par of plus kids and we had a great day at disneyland the weather was great and the park was crowded on thursday but the lines were not ridiculous the few attractions that had really long lines we used fast pass and went back later definitely recommend a day at disney ,4,2018-03-18
3060,Great Time,had a great time during spring break even with the park crowds disney always does a great job at their park making you feel welcome ,5,2018-03-18
3061,Expensive as always but kids still enjoy it,since the last time we ve visited disney anaheim years ago many things have changed starting with the parking lot now the parking lot is covered to get into the park you need to get down by the electric stairs on the side and just there you will find the security control area when you are done with this must go ahead and make a line to take the trolley remember to ride on the first or last car if you have a stroller like we did we were waiting in the wrong line and nobody told us the trolley will take you right to the entrance area into the park you will find many new things to see and do it was the nice part but it is still imposible to do all what you want when you have at least people waiting for it before you if you are visiting with kids don t forget to take some food with you inside everything is expensive even more than years ago and you must line up to get some food if you want souvenir are expensive too around for a mouse headband ,4,2018-03-18
3062,Amazing visit to Disneyland,celebrated my daughter s birthday by taking her to socal disneyland and a couple other theme parks got the city pass socal as it was a very good value highly recommend this day park hopper to disneyland cali adventure we had an amazing time disneyland we had magic morning and were able to ride several of the popular rides at least times star tours indiana jones jungle cruise matterhorn buzzlight year haunted mansion entering the park was a breeze with the socal pass scanned the barcode at the entrance worked with no issues you will have to line up with the rest if people that already have passes or tickets to get in first thing in the morning though my advice is buy the max pass so you dont have to run around the park to find fastfast machines it cost per person in your party also photo pass is included the park is really small compared to disney world but you have access to everything and i think that is even better we are all already planning our next visit in a year or two ,5,2018-03-18
3063,4 day to Disney,great time rode every ride we wanted to over the days maxpass is great good way to plan rides out and get pics on your phone easily fantasmic in frontierland and new orleans was cool great memories ,5,2018-03-18
3064,Happiest Place on Earth!,i would work here for free disneyland never gets old or out dated they continue to surprise and awe young and old alike splash mountain was closed as well as dumbo but there is so much to see and do it surely didn t dampen our spirits it seemed quite a busy day but i hadn t been in several years so quite possible it was a normal day i was unaware that you are allowed to bring in food and sodas thank you disney backpaks seem to be the norm great for snacks and refreshments while waiting in line great idea to get the fast pass unfortunately if the ride breaks down which was our only disappointment it doesn t help anyone hope to do space mountain again some day my husband is and i am we followed our two grandsons and with their mom and day i tracked over steps in one day best day of my life life doesn t get any better here at disneyland ,5,2018-03-17
3065,Disappointed,kids loved the rides adults included wonderful place just too many people in a small area fighting crowds all day rides were breaking down long waits even with fast pass didn t see mickey too often if yu did see him huge lines to get a pix no parades no fireworks not a lot of magical moments we live in the west think it would be worth it to spend extra money n go to disneyworld ,2,2018-03-17
3066,Exhausted, year olds parents grandparents exhausted wonderful peterpan needs fast pass some wonder cast members less magic from more than i would have liked dealing with the public is hard st time for royal meet and greet i hate the wait and that it has come to this however it was worth it in the end be aware that bibbity bobbity boutique gets cuts royal attendants in line helped tremendously at the the end for the last mins kudos thank you pure magic moment share the bridge with peter pan as he dashed up and crowed at pixie hollow and dashed off will be back california resident pass needs to go unless accompanied by full fare guest opinions ,5,2018-03-17
3067,My teenager said it was magical,my year old is hard to please he s into philosophy and a tough guy to impress after our day at disneyland he said that was magical and he then explained how disney made you feel special i was just thrilled that he was excited and happy we had a great day and the long lines and construction didn t bother us a bit that s magic ,5,2018-03-17
3068,One of my favorite disney parks!,hello fellow travellers i am going to write a small review about disneyland park in anaheim i have been to multiple disney parks around the globe and i have to say that this is one of my favorite disney parks ever it is small and compact and that is what i like from a theme park lots of things to do in a small and compact area overall great rights and also some good entertainment not to forget the food is as always really good price wise is it not the cheapest park to go to but you get a lot back for what you pay i believe ,5,2018-03-17
3069,Lot's of changes,it s been years since we visited snow white castle gone and new smaller frozen castle replacement sad sub ride much improved crowded oh did i say crowded do the fast pass if you want to reserve a restaurant i heard you can do it days in advance shame on them by late evening ride lines are zero to minutes ,4,2018-03-17
3070,fun,i not a ride person but i enjoyed all the rides at disneyland and california adventure get fastpass early and buy the maxpass to get free photo uploads to your phone,5,2018-03-16
3071,Better Get MAXPASS,ok firstly i say this i love disneyland and this trip was with my year old daughter on a day hopper pass we stayed straight and even did a tour and got into walt s firehouse apartment however here i talk about the new fast pass system maxpass firstly it will cost you per person in your party per day this includes the old photopass both of which are must does at the parks however and sadly everyone has this face in your phone thing going on i don t know how many people i bumped into as we were both on our phone getting our parties next fastpass a tip buy a external charger with all the use of your phone you ll run out of battery easy moreover the wifi in the park is hit and miss so how a good amount of data going in best of luck i noted the fastpass lines weren t so fast anymore with everyone using it ,1,2018-03-16
3072,Disney is Disney,wonderful entertainment for complete family kids enjoyed it to the maximum few problems the mobile app for disneyland needs an upgrade and should better be giving real time updates on shows and less rush places guidance arrangements at the entrance need to be more elaborate the pickup system from car parking to parks entrance appears to have been deliberately designed to delay people for avoiding rush at the reception i think it could be improved ,3,2018-03-16
3073,Amazing place for kids and adults you just say not enough,amazing place to go with kids and family its complete fun and you immerse yourself into the childhood characters you fantasied get opportunity to get clicked with them forget your camera dont worry they have photographers at all vantage points you little extra along with entry ticket download the disney app and all pics will be shared there same time lot of disney stuff to pack your bags and souvenirs to buy though bit expensive but for one time its ok worth a visit in a lifetime,5,2018-03-16
3074,Good for this time of year,i was looking forward to more i was looking forward to being the place walt built and seeing main street and seeing the castle and sadly it had so much construction you couldn t see it i did enjoy riding rides only at disneyland that walt had his hand in he still made it family friendly but you could tell how he didnt expect it to grow like it did because the wait lines areas where very short and the rides where on the smaller side but still available for anyone of any size i expect in summer or fall months it would look better when they were doing major construction we would see characters but they always said the line was already too long so i suggest being there before the character is suppose to be around and be the first few in line or you won t get to see them restrooms were clean and so was the park my husband and i still had lots of fun make sure you allow time for parking in the garage its and then you go thru a medical dector and then load on to a tram and then you get to the park so allow enough time in the morning lastly have fun and watch where your walking ,3,2018-03-15
3075,Family Vacation,the staff is very friendly and helpful the new disney app was a huge asset as you could see right from your phone how long the wait time was to ride all of the rides i love how they take such pride in keeping the park clean i love the paper maps that were provided as well it is great how all rides can accommodate families ,5,2018-03-15
3076,Enjoyable for children and adults.,i have been here thirty years ago and returned with my family recently this was a better than expected experience although some of the rides are dated the overall experience was enjoyable download the disney park app and arrive with a game plan take advantage of the fastpass system and magic mornings pre purchase your tickets before your arrive and if you buy from a rd party make sure you bring your id for each family member this will save time the prices for food inside the park is high so i suggest bring your own snacks and lunches ,4,2018-03-15
3077,Happiest place on earth,thoroughly loved our day at disney so much to see and do enjoyed meeting mickey and goofy and loved the shopping we ate at the park and at downtown disney and the food was great hope to visit again ,5,2018-03-14
3078,Disappointed in Disneyland,knowing how amazing disney can be we booked our tickets a while back to take two young teenaged girls this trip was super disappointing for various reasons and before you go you should know space mountain ride was down for most of the day matterhorn ride was down after an hour of waiting in line no fireworks due to construction on site no parade due to construction on site extremely overcrowded as per usual haunted house ride stopped for minutes while we were riding indiana jones ride closed when we had our fastpasses and in general no theme characters in site no matter where we looked and walked away from young kids waiting for autographs after complaining to a park member services staff we did get two fastpass rides added to our tickets he was lovely and apologetic in general the staff are very unfriendly also castle is half the size of orlando s disneyworld as per usual the souvenirs hoodies food is all over priced as canadians we spent well over for a day that definitely missed the disney mark ,1,2018-03-14
3079,Our favorite!!,we frequent disney with our family of we always have a wonderful time and can t wait to go back ,5,2018-03-14
3080,Magical Day,loved pirates of the carribean and the outdoor cafe cafe orleans the mattahorn kept breaking down but i hope they never remove it because it s a classic we re used to disneyworld in florida but this was just as good can t wait to go back ,5,2018-03-14
3081,better meet and greats,we didnt like our visit being limited because of construction but we loved the new area to go to meet more princesses and this is definitely a day park where cali side is a half day day park perfect for even new borns with the hidden area to take your new baby in for cool air diaper changes etc we will always go back,5,2018-03-13
3082,Family Trip 2018,extended family vacation with we did the one day pass with max pass we had infants toddlers teenagers and adults and every dream came true for each of us ,5,2018-03-13
3083,What magic!,we were on a birthday celebration and we had such a great time the rides are still fun we had a wheelchair for my husband and disneyland really goes all out to help accommodate the handicapped special place perfect to make family memories again we had early admission because we stayed at the hotel and that extra hour really helped us reide of the popular rides ,5,2018-03-13
3084,So much fun!!,wow first time ever at disneyland it s everything it s made up to be so much to do the kids had so much fun i feel like we could have stayed for two weeks and still not get through all there is to do better reason to come back soon ,5,2018-03-13
3085,Great place for a date or to take your children,it does not matter how old or young you are disneyland is a wonderful place great for everyone the only downside is the cost and the crowds but if you can accept those you will have fun the fireworks show at night is great all kinds of food and snacks and of course the great rides be sure to check out it s a small world and cinderella s castle ,4,2018-03-13
3086,It is not Disney World,the park is nice but was small the staff definitely acts like it is just a job which makes the experience less unique ,3,2018-03-13
3087,Amazing,disneyland was amazing went with a friend we had the day pass spent the first day at disney and the other two at california adventure park the park was incredibly clean everyone was friendly and helpful the only downsides were the incredibly long wait for lines wish we knew about fastpasses the first day and the variety in food could not find a sandwich anywhere i mean a australian sandwich not a chicken burger would definitely go back though helpful hint when you are lining up for splash mountain there are signs that say you may get wet we go absolutely soaked from head to toe best to do this ride at the end of the day we were freezing ,4,2018-03-13
3088,1 ply toilet roll says it all...,my other half is a bit of a disney enthusiast to say the least so she loves it but i have also enjoyed visiting disney in anaheim in the past as well as paris and wdw this time we visited for days and i something about the experience made me snap i just couldn t help getting really angry at how much disney are taking us all for a ride and how the general population seem either oblivious to it or happy to be treated with such contempt i know it s silly but the thing that got me really thinking about it all was whilst using the rest room now i don t know about you but i have never seen ply toilet roll used anywhere i ve ever been even the most awful cheap motels i ve had the misfortune of staying in don t use it and yet disney somewhere that charges an incredible amount of money to enter has the cheek to do this what does it save their shareholders a few pennies per roll probably and whilst i was able to deal with the situation by quadruple rolling it up before using what s a child who s probably never encountered see through toilet roll before going to do without getting too graphic probably make a mess of their hand after i d noticed this i just couldn t help but notice how much disney has become a perfect example of corporate greed at the same time i was shocked to see how the general population seemed to just accept situations and conditions that would be considered unacceptable pretty much anywhere else it s almost as if people have paid so much money to get in that they are so determined to have a good time and so ignore what s going on obviously overcrowding is a major problem but i would also say that the price of things in the park is the biggest insults to paying guests for example tax for a banana really tax for a pickle i don t know how much these things normally cost in the us but a banana would be less than p and a pickle probably a little bit less and for a bottle of water when we all know you can buy one in a supermarket for or half that in costco or the like why do people put up with it well it s disney you expect to pay more would be the response from die hard fans i say a reasonable mark up is fair enough but the prices for my examples are an insult to guests who have already paid over the odds to get in yet there they are queues of people waiting to hand over their hard earned cash knowing full well they re being ripped off and almost being grateful for it my favourite was the queue for dole whip in fantasy land no exaggeration there s around a minute queue for people to purchase some whippy icecream and pineapple for tax absolutely insane me and my partner had the lovely experience of queuing over half an hour for two portions of chicken nuggets and chips in fantasyland those plus two drinks in excess of and then having to sit on the floor and eat them as all the seats had been taken then there s the queues for the rides we visited as off season as you can get and yet there were queues of over an hour for childrens story book rides queues of over two hours for bigger attractions and even a minute queue to get in the park would anyone pay hundreds of dollars to visit literally anywhere else in america and accept that minutes of your day was spent queuing to get in i highly doubt it i could go on but i think my points above summarise my feelings well disney has become a greedy uncaring company and whilst at the moment the fans are putting up with it one by one they will notice what s going on and i hope not come back to their parks or their hotels the addition of star wars land next year could be the start of this as this will push the parks to capacity or beyond for several months and this is going to make paying guests miserable i hope so anyway i hope that disneyland starts to see declining guests and a good kicking financially so that it can start going back to what it used to be i will not be returning despite my other half s protests to everyone giving it stars and saying it s magical get real i bet you could have a more magical time taking those s of and spending them elsewhere they d go a lot further ,2,2018-03-12
3089,It is Always Magic at Disney,this was the first time we were here with our grandkids we had a days pass we went through get away today and received a discount so we could come each day but not feel like we had to stay all day with the young kids main street is all boarded up for refurbishment which it sad because it is so iconic and i missed seeing that you walk down the side walks with walls in the street all the way to the castle we picked the first week in february because there was no holidays and we thought it would be less crowded nope we were wrong the weather was beautiful degrees so i think everyone with a yearly pass came out as well we had a early magic morning you pick one tu th sa when you get into the park an hour before everyone else this was horrible it seems everyone has one of these so we found it more crowded and since only two lands were open in the park fantasyland and tomorrowland everyone was crammed into these two areas we will skip this next time go early to the park on m w f and be first in line to enter and you will have the park relatively to yourself for about hours security is tight and you will have to go through it each time you enter leave the park those without any bags breeze through we had strollers and bags so it takes a while to get through disney allows food and drink into the park which was great for our long grandkids most of the rides were open be sure to check the park for closures when you will be coming they do fast passes for a lot of the most popular rides which allows you to come back at the determined time to enter a much shorter line these worked great and we were able to get on the rides a lot faster disney does magic well with the characters they were plentiful and the lines relatively short to talk to them and take pictures there were no parades due to main st being closed they did have some of the characters and the disney band play and they marched up between the castle and the matterhorn fantasyland is so old and needs updating the rides are dark and dingy and this is where they want little kids to hang out they need to update with some of the newer disney movies moanna tangled etc the kids don t know mr toads while ride pinocchio and snow white we went to see mickey s magical map in the outdoor theater and it was very cute it kept our little ones attention and was a nice cool break friday was so packed that you couldn t move in the afternoon and evening we weren t there on saturday or sunday but i imagine it was worse plan your days to avoid weekends so many so cal have season passes the food in the park was surprisingly good and the prices were not as high as i had remembered we gave our kids disney gift cards from costco sams club and these worked great you didn t need cash and only had to carry the card they take them everywhere on the disney property we would do this again we stayed at the marriott fairfield inn on harbor blvd it is right across the street from the main entrance and was an ideal place to stay and walk to the park rooms were very nice per night book early months in advance disney is always magical and amazing for kids if you plan to make the most of your visit ,5,2018-03-12
3090,Loved it!,i have been to wdw in florida a dozen times but this was my first trip to disneyland and it exceeded my expectations the florida parks have become rather complicated over the years requiring significant advance planning in order to enjoy a desirable table service meal or ride one of the more popular attractions so i loved that dinseyland maintains that simplicity and spontaneity that i remember about disney from when i was a child we are a family that loves characters and they are so abundant in disneyland and dca i love that the characters are everywhere and i love the surprise of seeing cinderella or snow white just walking around something that you would never see in florida any more the live entertainment is also abundant every few steps you happen upon a band playing it really makes the park feel magical we were here during january when there were a lot of closures and midday wait times did get a bit long but we still had a very enjoyable days in disneyland and dca we did day park hoppers and it was perfect it is so easy to zip across from one park to another depending on a character availability or low wait time we ended our park days with dinner at the jolly holiday overlooking the beautiful lights of main street and sleeping beauty castle and it was such a poetic way to end a trip that i believe it will become a tradition for my family ,5,2018-03-12
3091,A nice visit!,first visited in early and also been to disney world orlando which is bigger still have fond memories the happiest place on earth great day for families couples anyone there is something for everyone at disneyland prices have gotten expensive so we choose a weekday to maximize our time there,4,2018-03-12
3092,Finding timeless joy in a magical but very crowded place,my lifelong friend and i meet here every other year to relive the joy of childhood visits and the magic of the whole disney culture we grew up with we re so happy to see that it s all being passed down the generations and that parents and grandparents are sharing their own experiences and helping make new memories for kids from toddler age on disneyland is being preserved for the ages and we re so glad to see it the down side is that this place is loved to death and always crowded but we ve found some ways of maneuvering around the crowds to distill that disney magic being older we bypass the more physically demanding newer rides and stick with the nostalgic ones that means we always start in fantasyland where even the clanking of metal and bumping of doors along the ride route bring back childhood memories and feelings we know the peter pan ride is most popular so head there first thing in early morning we got lucky this trip and were visiting after overnight rain so had a reasonable wait for this ride for the rest of our visit we noted that the line was too insane and slow for aging feet the other fantasyland rides have more reasonable lines but you need to get there first thing in morning light as the crowds build through the morning we head out of fantasyland and turn to some lesser known and underrated rides such as winnie the pooh in critter country and roger rabbit in mickey s toon town for us the crown jewel of every visit is the spectacular pirates of the caribbean crowding is less of an issue for this ride because the lines move quickly but as always the earlier the better this visit we rediscovered that some old stalwarts are just as magical as always and less crowded than some of the other attractions we were ecstatic to find that the train ride through the land of dinosaurs and grand canyon had been newly refurbished and the colors brightened up and took us right back to the first time we experienced them we also took time to ride the mark twain riverboat and journey along the mississippi as we did back in the s the lifelike moose and the indian chief raising his arm in peace are early harbingers of the robotic achievements of pirates of the caribbean working around the mob scene during our visit we took haven in less crowded frontierland to soak up the old fashioned atmosphere toward the end of our magic morning we headed for critter country in that wooded farthest corner of the park it was so uncrowded in the morning light we felt we in a national park we ve also discovered some less crowded eating places with good quality cheap eats and lovely patio seating for the past few years we have had early lunch at the stage door cafe in frontierland where they have good quality fish and chips with optional apple slices this trip we discovered jolly holiday bakery cafe on main street where they have a talented pastry chef and tasty sandwiches and salads as with everything best to go early to both places to get good seating by early afternoon we find that it s hard to even walk around in the park because of the crowding so we settle in for coffee and relaxation on main street or in frontierland and then head back to the hotel for a break before heading over to california adventure which by the way is more crowded every visit and less of a haven from the mob scene our more sedate way of enjoying disneyland isn t for everyone but hopefully we ve offered some helpful pointers our biggest wish for disneyland would be for disney corp to lower the prices so more kids could experience the magic and build the memories that live on over the generations ,5,2018-03-12
3093,Overcrowding spoiling Disneyland,i visited in august prior to that i visited in although i enjoyed my visits i did not enjoy my visit disneyland is becoming overcrowded due to its popularity after paying a usd entry fee i gave up trying to go on any rides due to the excessive wait times of around hour sadly i stayed only for hours frontierland was my favourite ,3,2018-03-12
3094,A nice visit on a rainy day!,the forecast said rain but the plan had been set while going through the entrance it started hailing and continued as we made our way up main street no one seemed to mind i think people were thrilled to get to use their disney umbrellas which i saw popping open all over the nice thing was that it only drizzled after that hail and really only rained while we were eating lunch so a disneyland visit is great on a rainy southern california day barely any lines walked right on haunted and pirates ,5,2018-03-12
3095,Amanda’s Birthday,had a great time haven t been to disneyland and two decades and it seemed in great condition lots of neat additions we went on a wednesday so lines were moderate we download the disney app it was awesome used it for all of the rides at two restaurants restaurants and attractions parking was easy bathrooms were clean plenty of food to choose from,5,2018-03-12
3096,Love,love going always a great time best advice is to check sites to check crowds expected mornings are always the least busy in the park and make dining reservations ,4,2018-03-11
3097,Consistently a good experience,disneyland is as always just as we expect it s clean and well maintained the staff is always on point and friendly the food is not spectacular but it is good for being at a theme park disneyland may not be for everybody but for us it is consistently a fun place for us to take family for a good time and it never disappoints ,5,2018-03-11
3098,DisneyLand - maybe not the happiest place on Earth.,so disneyland i admit i haven t been since i was eight and was returning in my mid s with no children of my own the crowds were overwhelming even though this was supposed to be the slow season and so much was under renovation that you hoped the exorbitant ticket price you paid had been discounted a bit considering how many things had been closed down or altered for construction still it s disney and you ve got to do this for the niece and nephew you never see as you all live in different states it was all pretty exciting seeing it through a child s eyes although i ll admit i was too busy watching out for caffeine crazed buggy pushing moms on a mission to do much seeing from their point of view actually i d imagine things would be more terrifying at their height but they seemed happy enough with thoughts of mickey and minnie dancing around in their heads there were too many moments of real life frogger for all you old people to count we made a valiant effort in frontierland and tomorrowland but there s so much of the park and only so much you can do with such ridiculously long lines again this was the slow season that i have no idea how much we missed with the incredible push to get to the park as early as possible to try and beat the crowds then the lengthy wait because everyone else had the same idea you did and then the need to shut down the park hours later in order to squeeze out every possible experience because the price of those tickets was no joke i saw more crying children and grim faced parents than i saw happy ones we were all tired and certain we were being taken advantage of but you have to do this for the kids right we bought a bottle of water oz which i began to fill up from bathroom faucets because the water fountains were few and far between isn t that a safety risk maybe they assume water is readily available just for at your nearest souvenir shop ridiculous we bought tiny chicken sandwiches in the winnie the pooh area and honestly asked ourselves what we were doing there we headed over to the blue bayou for dinner as it was my sister in law s birthday and this was her favorite place unfortunately we encountered one of disney s villains while there a host who was over being a decent human being we couldn t get a table because they require reservations although my brother apparently got different information when he d called earlier to make said reservation and this rude host made things far worse with his horrible attitude i ve never encountered any one so awful in the service industry and i m from the service industry it was shocking it was cool to meet chewbacca and darth vader and see my niece and nephew light up when meeting tigger and pooh those memories are priceless but i m still not certain they re worth what we ended up parting with by the end of the day we ached all over for days afterwards and tried not to think about all the money spent at some point one has to wonder why we do these things to ourselves why do we let these companies take such advantage ,3,2018-03-11
3099,"Good, but no Disneyworld",disneyland is nice quaint and a must for any disney enthusiast but after just one visit i had my fill it s nice and all but the crowds and wait times got to me at least at disneyworld there are other parks and activities to thin out the crowds a little more at disneyland you are stuck at one park a couple of the rides do have disneyworld beat pirates of the caribbean small world but overall disneyworld takes the prize hands down ,3,2018-03-11
3100,Amazing mommy daughter trip,one of the most magical trips ive ever been on staff is amazing and helpful will be coming back for sure ,5,2018-03-11
3101,Some of the cast need to brush up on the magic,while the park rating alone would be excellent it seems some of the staff need a refresher course on customer service a nice greeting at the entrance gate can go a long way in setting the tone as for some of the ride attendants let s just say if you don t like interacting with people consider a different line of work we had a great time and enjoyed the visit because we would not let a handful of less than stellar staff interactions ruin our trip but have had better experiences in the past ,4,2018-03-10
3102,Magical but too crowded,visited here during president s day week mon thur there was construction going on along main street which made congestion awful tom sawyer island haunted mansion and the treehouse were fun to see since those were around last time i visited years ago the buzz lightyear ride was fun too be prepared to walk miles a day disney is very clean staff are constantly picking up trash and wiping garbage cans down the jungle boat ride needs to be updated it wasn t very fun it s a small world was cute so was mr toad s wild ride and snow white there are a lot of snacks here popcorn ice cream and churros but real food was harder to find ,3,2018-03-10
3103,Happiest Place on Earth,i literally grinnned ear to ear nearly all days at dlr having so much fun feeling like yo again riding all the fun rides and seeing all the kids having fun i highly recommend preparing for your visit with some research about what rides you want to tackle in what order and where to eat because it s just too overwhelming once in the park touringplans is a good place to start well worth the small fee to customize a plan don t be too strict with your plan and you ll do just great at least having hit the rides you most wanted to go on even in days we did not hit even close to all the rides at the parks but we did hit all the rides we had planned on i highly recommend getting the maxpass on your phone for electronic fast passes plus all disney photos are included pp including jedi training photos speaking of jedi training if you have an under star wars fan once inside dlr go immediately to the star wars launch bay exit and sign your child up for the jedi training which is about min start to finish at a later time in the day and your kids will have one of the most exciting free events of their life fighting as a jedi against kylo ren and darth vader in front of an audience get your fast pass to space mountain as you are walking after you sign your child up for jedi training you have the ability to jump on a very short line in autopia it will get much longer later then you can jump in the short nemo submarine ride line then over to matterhorn and back to space mountain you will walk alot so wear your best walking shoes allow for some meltdowns from being hungry or tired or overstimulated both kids and adults and remember to do a little extra indulgence by a treat or surprise for the kids and this can be one of the most memorable experiences your family will remember stop by new orleans square mint julep counter or cafe orleans for super cool yummy mickey beignets donuts consider getting a charcoal or watercolor portrait done pricey as a souveneir for years to come also in nola square had the most fun these days with my son such a memorable time together before he hits his teens ,5,2018-03-10
3104,Always Five Stars!!,i will always give disneyland five stars this is our family s favorite vacation spot even under construction disneyland was able to give the sensation that we had left reality for five days our most recent trip we took advantage of the max passes and photopass in addition to our standard entry and magic morning extra magic hour the max pass saved us time walking around obtaining fast passes and the photo pass left us with photos we can treasure for years to come the big one that stood out for my husband and i was our purchase of the fantasmic dining package through the blue bayou restaurant in the park with the package you are supposed to eat dinner then immediately after get front row seats to the fantasmic show however the kitchen was running behind and we nearly missed the show due to the timing photo pickups needed and my over exhausted daughter she and i had to miss the show while my husband and two sons went to the show when the manager noticed we were missing the show she immediately said that was wrong for us to pay for the show and have to miss it to make up for it she promised when returned two days later there would be front row tickets for that night s fantasmic performance waiting for us when we arrived at dinner we were excited to find they were in fact there the manager even came over to check on our dinner and told us there would also be fast passes for our whole family for our final day in the park as magical as the park is already to see the park go to such lengths to make our trip memorable was everything to us we will comeback every chance we get ,5,2018-03-10
3105,Sign up for Annual pass holder,it worth it for you to visit every once a week travel and eat all around disneyland park it s good experience you must try once ,5,2018-03-10
3106,Worst Disney experience at “the most magical place on earth”,our family travels to disney parks times a year if not more and as a family of this is not an affordable trip however we love disney so much the expense is worth it we usually go to disney world however decided to take a quick trip to disneyland this year we purchased day one park tickets for our family we went to disneyland park days and california adventure for one day before leaving we find out many rides were shut down as well as part of main street which we had no choice at this point as flights were booked and time had been taken from work the first day february we went to disneyland park we tried to find the days that we could use our magic morning and the employees in the ticket booth were helpful in finding the days but in no way made the experience magical usually at park opening the train comes around with characters on it and a family to open the park and on this day the train arrived with no characters and they did a park opening with a family on the ground in front of park gates that no one could see and it wasn t very enthusiastic the process of getting into the park was tedious scan your ticket take a photo so your ticket cannot be used by anyone else and sign your ticket the gate employees are rather rude and just want to get you in and gone walking into the park our kids were excited so we headed toward the rides the ride lines were longer than usual which may be because so many rides were closed at once there was a strange incident while we were in line for the gadget coaster in toontown the ride was stopped and an announcement was made as if the ride had a maintenance issue but come to find out there was a man that had a selfie stick and was trying to use it on the ride we waited about minutes until security got there to remove him and proceed to argue with him at the ride exit we asked about fireworks and were told by an employee that fireworks were only on the weekends and depended on weather we purchased some items at the store outside of space mountain and the employees were helpful and answered questions and helped us find the sizes we were looking for there were no parades due to construction on main street and no fireworks on this day so we ended up leaving the park earlier than we normally would day at disneyland was what really made this trip awful on day my brother and his family joined us my niece is autistic and gets sever anxiety when standing in long unending lines so my sister in law called ahead to make sure she would be able to get an ada pass for the lines and she was told she could we waited in line at town hall for what seemed like an hour they finally got in and requested the pass and my sister in law was made to feel like she was lying they asked a million questions about her disability etc if it s the case that someone needs to prove an actual disability why wasn t she told over the phone to bring some type of proof with her however we saw many able bodied people cruising up the exit line with their wheelchairs were the given the same treatment your employees really need some training about autism and how if effects each person differently we proceeded to the rides after the questions and tried to have a good day this pass my niece was given was an awful waste of time she had to go to a specific stand in the entire park to get one fast pass which many times it seemed the fast pass lines were longer than the regular lines but hey if we would have spent an a day we could have pre booked our fast passes a service that is free at disneyworld we ate lunch in cafe orleans and it was great the waitstaff was quick to clear our plates and have friendly conversation with us wish all the disneyland employees were so great we rode a few more rides and part of our group left for a nap later that evening we headed to the queue for fantasmic we were pointed to the viewing area for people we did not get fast passes and at the entrance of this queue we asked were stroller parking was and we were told to take it with us we were walking in dim lighting mind you and looking for a spot with a grumpy tired year old jumping out of his stroller we were distracted i will say but how many parents at disneyland go thru the same thing every single day while we were walking not focused on the ground which i guess we were expected to be shania stepped in front of my stroller and said rudely this area is for fast pass only do you have a fastpass we told her no that someone pointed us down here for queueing of people who did not have fast passes she told us see this line a line of green tape on the ground that is not really noticeable you need to stay on that side so we found seats and sat down unfortunately we were near to ride shania and another employee who talked the whole time we were waiting we heard all about her snap chat listened to her sing about being mixed i m also mixed along with my kids so this is in no way related to that listened to her playing and joking all the while being rude to everyone that didn t see her line then she felt the need to approach us again after sitting in the same spot for minutes to tell us we needed to move our stroller to the back we loved the stroller and finally the show started the show was great and we left the experience we had during this disneyland trip was so awful we don t want to return ever i guess our family got used to the great service at disneyworld we re employees are nice and friendly at all times we never see them on their phones and when they are standing around queuing people they don t talk about irrelevant things they try to keep that disney experience away from the outside world the unfortunate thing is despite all the negative reviews disneyland is getting is that nothing will change and it will continue to nosedive because the hundred of families that are having awful experiences won t change ticket sales so they won t change anything and will continue to raise prices and families will pay to get to experience the theory of disneyland i wrote this review in hopes that if people keep pointing out the awful experiences they are having then maybe these kids you are hiring will get some customer service skills instead of continuing to think that they can treat people however they choose because even if that family or person doesn t return others will get it together disneyland for the millions of other families that are going to waste their money time and family vacation time on coming there ,1,2018-03-10
3107,A fun workout,be prepared to walk like you have never walked we scheduled our visit on historically less busy days and times and would definitely recommend doing this if you hate long wait times took days to manage to get tickets for the fantasmic show you really need to do early entry to get these but it is worth it i can t do the fast rides but there are plenty more gentle rides play the fast pass game so that you cut down on wait times more but watch out for the times as you are limited to fast passes while waiting for one to expire there are plenty instant fast passes especially the likes of buzz light year and later in the day everything is expensive you expect that in disney ,4,2018-03-09
3108,too crowded....,we went on a monday march we waited minutes to get in we were in line at minutes til and didn t get in the park til ridiculous there was no where we could walk that we weren t literally running into people i got the feeling californians come here all the time i heard one person say this was his th time to the park this year they must have a big discount this was not considered the heavy time of year yet but i can t imagine it being any more crowded ,3,2018-03-09
3109,Magical,i ve been to disneyland hong kong tokyo and disneyworld but i ve yet to go to disneyland till this past february and i can t believe i have not gone here before even with some big rides being under maintenance this place is truly magical downtown disney and disneyland is awesome do yourself a favour and get the max pass as you get into the park to get fastpass s faster and easier ,5,2018-03-09
3110,"A bucket list ""must do""",sure this place is over priced and over busy but save up your money and go with the right attitude we had our kids earn their own money for treats and souvenirs most important go at the right time we went first week of march and the line ups were reasonable especially early morning and later at night and if you maximize your fast pass use liked peter pan ride kids and hubbie loved the matterhorn and did it numerous times finding nemo was cool tea cups were a classic one of the original disney rides train ride around the park is worth doing and you will see things only seen on the train plus it can save you some walking my younger daughter got her hair makeup and nails done at boutique and she was beside herself with excitement my family will always remember this trip ,5,2018-03-09
3111,Disney customer relations is amazing!,on our last day in the park my very expensive prescription sunglasses must have fallen out of my bag i didn t realize it until we were back at our hotel in newport beach and scheduled to fly out the next day i called the lost and found to report my lost glasses and the day i arrived home they called to say they had found them and would be sending them to me free of charge thank you disney ,5,2018-03-08
3184,Adult only trip,disney really knows how to cater to groups of all ages we had a blast bring kids for two days the park is immaculate always i never ran into one cast member that was not super friendly they know how to train employees my favorite place to be the one complaint i noticed this time was even when the bathrooms were really clean they did not always have a clean smell this was the first time i have ever noticed it it was consistent over many trips to the restrooms over a two day period a friend has mentioned that there was always someone using a changing table and maybe it was diapers in the trash cans maybe disney should find a creative solution to that with so many families with littles being there ,5,2018-03-07
3185,More fun than I expected,wife and i went we re in our s because we thought why not i wasn t sure what to expect but once you allow yourself to be a kid and be a little silly it can be a ton of fun we only bought the one day pass for disneyland and there was plenty to do to occupy the day we were a little miffed at the crowds for a monday in february why weren t all those kids in school but the lines weren t terrible for any ride the extra for fastpass is totally worth it only reason i wouldn t give it stars is because it was still extremely slow and somewhat inefficient actually getting into the park we arrived just before am and it still took almost minutes before we got through the front gate ,4,2018-03-06
3186,Fun Day...Even Without Kids!,we took a day before attending a conference to spend at disneyland and had a great time we got the fast pass and took in some rides and did some shopping the park is large enough to get more than the recommended steps day but small enough that you can tour the entire park in a day it was a fun way to spend some down time ,4,2018-03-05
3187,"The original Magic Kingdom is still great, but getting a little worn around the edges.",having been to the disney properties in orlando paris and tokyo it was kind of fun to visit the original they have updated their attractions to include star wars and finding nemo themed rides still the place is showing its years age it is not nearly as spotlessly clean as other venues as i recall and there are construction barriers all over the park especially main street the railroad train that circles the park stalled for hours ,2,2018-03-04
3188,Helpful Disney Cast Member,on our second last day in anaheim after spending great days at disneyland and california adventure one cast member really went above and beyond to make our trip memorable ,4,2018-03-04
3189,First visit,had a wonderful trip my advise would be to read up as much as possible lots of tips out there and well worth the time ,5,2018-03-03
3190,MaxPass Needs Better Wi-Fi to Work Reliably,disney is timeless and what other reviewers have said about the cleanliness safety incredible cast members staffing and overall feel of the park is dead on we go to disney about once a year and this was our first experience with the maxpass system as we are from canada we relied upon the wi fi in the park to access the app while the wi fi in disneyland is merely sub par usually bars occasionally no connection or rarely in california adventure park it is occasionally bars usually or bar never bars we relied on the old way to get fast passes i e going to the distribution centres and as it was february and really cold under c f most of the time and windy we were able to get on most rides reasonably quickly only needing fast passes for matterhorn and space mountain and for cars and soaring over the world in california adventure park some tips the food at sit down restaurants is far better value than the carts on the pathways the prices at the higher end restaurants blue bayou and carthay circle restaurant are not much different than comparable restaurants outside the park if you are addicted to the mint julep in new orleans square that drink is bottomless if purchased with your meal at blue bayou the quietest time in the park is typically sunday night as the park is open until midnight and is far less busy than on a saturday night ,5,2018-03-03
3191,Great day in the park,had a wonderful day in the park i really enjoyed how everything in the park seemed to be more compact and easier to get to in relation to disney world our wait time we not very long which could be partially due to a partly rainy day in the s the rides were awesome indians jones being my personal favorite next to matterhorn the food was awesome as well i started off at the red rose tavern with a poutine flatbread which was very unique and delicious for dessert i had the grey stuff gateau the bomb it was light with a raspberry center and some cake i also tried the strawberry rose gold churros from the cart in front of the castle these were unexpectedly awesome as well but you must like strawberry flavoring and sprinkles everywhere before the tiki room we grabbed some dole whip in all its pineapple y glory one of our last indulgences were the mickey mouse beignets powder sugar everywhere in the best of ways i apologize for this being such a good centric post but our visit was full of awesome food and great rides ,5,2018-03-03
3192,A Truly Magical Place,you are transported to a truly magical place as you walk up to the ticket booths and entrance once inside let your inner child out and experience the wonder of disney they know how to move people keep the interest up and make your experience a happy day because so many people need to have a magical experience be prepared to wait in line relax what else do you have to do on such a special day ,5,2018-03-03
3193,My Happy Place,our th visit and certainly wont be our last disneyland brings out the kid in my year old body love the rides park is clean staff are excellent cant wait to go back ,5,2018-02-28
3194,Family with Young Adult Children,do yourself a favor and get max pass we were able to ride everything we wanted while we were there the first week of jan we heard the parks were near capacity every day plus the photo pass was amazing ,5,2018-02-28
3195,Free Disney Fun!,make the most of your day at disneyland by taking advantage of wonderful free things for star wars fans between the age of and years sign up for the free jedi academy children learn light saber skills and test them against darth vader and kylo ren such a great photo op participants receive a cool pin and its all free the academy is offered multiple times throughout the day but it does fill up upon arrival immediately head to register at the kiosk by the star wars launch bay near the tomorrowland terrace ask a cast member if you can t find it a second important free offering is fast passes these allow you to go to a ride and receive a return time to avoid waiting in line before you visit read the details of how a fast pass works which ride offers it and plan which rides you will use it on then in the meantime you can go on other rides with shorter wait times finding the free perks makes the happiest place on earth even happier ,5,2018-02-27
3196,Was not impressed!,i was never at a disney park so when my daughter had a conference in anaheim i happily went along to take my granddaughter to disney world we went the beginning of november and most of the shows did not happen during the week mickey and minnie mouse were great on the weekend but during the week first thing in the morning they were not very friendly so disappointing we paid the same as people in the busy season and i did not appreciate so many shows closed was definitely not the happiest place on earth and i will probably never go back ,3,2018-02-26
3197,not good,go somewhere where there were some guards who came to me that they thought it was me who did something criminal or something and i did not even get the money back kr away on nothing,1,2018-02-22
3198,Good times but long lines,the whole setting and the themes of this place is gorgeous to be in and the rides are pretty fun too the food is also pretty to look at and tastes good however even if you spend the whole day there you could probably ride about or rides the place is quite crowded which makes lines extremely long and tiring to be in you have to stand in line for about an hour for each ride which is crazy but besides that the overall experience is great ,4,2018-02-20
3199,"Fun, but it's not Disney World",we are regular visitors at disney world so thought we d give disneyland a try while it was fun it was just not the same disney service that we are used to it felt like a really nice six flags they did have a great variety of rides but no shows the weekdays were not too busy and we could relax and enjoy ourselves but come friday about watch out all of the locals came and it was jam packed all friday evening and all day saturday we ve never seen crowds like we experienced at disneyland the line for dole whip looked like it was a mile long for true disney fun head to florida ,4,2018-02-17
3200,Under construction,i am so bummed that our disneyland trip was sub par many parts of the park are closed including the main st this is located at the main entrance point of the park and one of the most iconic sections large walls lined both sides of the road forcing patrons to choose which side of main st to walk on it also caused congestion and took away from the charm of the park not to mention the walls were so tall and took up main st from start to finish you couldn t even see the walt disney statue or castle splash mountain was also closed as they were doing work it additionally parts of small world and fantasyland were closed to be honest you could tell the whole park is going under a revamp this is something disney did not explain before going a part of me feels like we were gipped out of the true experience i wouldn t pay to go here until all of the work is complete i m sure it will look great in the future but it was very much a let down as i know what the park could offer if all it s sections were opened and disney if you read this don t cheat your customers let them know about these things ahead of time ,2,2018-02-15
3201,First time visitor!,have been to disney world before first time disneyland we decided to do the max pass along with our ticket and it was totally worth it it gives you a fast pass with out having to be in the area of the ride you want and any disney professional who takes your picture with any character or at any designated area you get all the pictures worth it when we were there and they said til spring time so something to keep in mind if you go in the next couple months the main street is blocked off with construction there are no parades at this time or fireworks with the castle knowing this before you go will help with decisions and experience we did not know this and was a little disappointed when seeing it however it did not ruin our experience we had a very fun time spent the day we even did a fantasmic dining package i highly suggest and don t forget to go through the castle where the sleeping beauty story is displayed ,4,2018-02-13
3202,Meh...Terrible Traffic Control and So Much Under Construction,love you disney but barricades all the way down main street made foot traffic a nightmare the indiana jones adventure broke down as we stood at the turnstiles to board the ride on the morning it broke down again when we were getting ready to head back for our fast pass reservation near the end of the evening most of paradise pier was under construction and it s impossible to get a reservation at a restaurant in either park when you do they cancel it without notice see my review on wine country trattoria in all for the price of admission completely not worth the headache also you should have left tower of terror alone i love guardians of the galaxy and the video component is gray but tot was very special guardians is just ok tot was only thing worthwhile about california adventure ,2,2018-02-12
3203,Disapointed!!,i was so looking forward to our disney vacation but i have to say that it was a disappointment this was my first time to the park and my last the on california and on disneyland side rides that we wanted to go on were closed plus there were major issues with other rides why would they close the ferris wheel and the roller coaster at the same time we spent good money to travel there feeling like we wanted more out of our experience than we had i truly did not get the magical feeling that they portray in their advertisements i wish i went to mexico instead ,3,2018-02-12
3204,We love our Disney trips every year!,disney is a trip our family looks forward to every year we usually go in february but have tried all times of the year while february is nice because the crowds are usually lower the park hours are shorter and they usually have some rides shut down either way it s amazing and a must for kids and families we have kids under years old and all of them love it happiest place on earth ,5,2018-02-11
3205,We Just Don’t Understand What All The Hype Is About,i kept asking family members if there were things to do at disney that didn t revolve around rides not really most of the rides suck we were there on a slower day mid week in feb the wait times weren t too long minutes even still we waiting that long to get on to a ride that is really just a parade for a movie that was released years ago the park was under construction i don t really care about that part the park was clean and the staff was friendly the food was not memorable when it comes time to eat either bring your lunch from home or go to downtown disney it is a nice perk that they allow you to bring in your own food we also like they they would give you free water cups with ice upon request i would be just fine if i didn t come back to disneyland there isn t anything here that is worth what you pay for ,2,2018-02-11
3206,Everything was closed,at least four of the attractions were closed because of the renovations we travel from mexico just too see the fireworks at the castle but there wasn t any show there because of the magic renovations at least for us the fantasmic show was pretty good ,2,2018-02-08
3207,Disappointing - won’t be returning,husband i had very fond memories of previous visits to disneyland which we had hoped to share with our teenage chn however the excessive number of people let into the park meant huge queues for everything i m talking hour waits for a single ride food drink queues also long consequently the whole day became ride centric and we obtained little magic that such an experience should afford additionally the fast pass app was down however this had only succeeded in getting us one ride more quickly the previous day at disney california anyway all disappointed ,2,2018-01-28
3208,Very poor value,the sparkle has gone out disney for me they seem much more interested in relieving you of as much money as possible than delivering a fabulous family experience the only upside was the mickey show at the end of the day however that cost over for food to get a decent seat tickets expensive food drinks expensive rides entertainment dated poor value if the kids are older than i wouldn t bother ,2,2018-01-28
3209,Disneyland,waste of money for seniors i paid approximately canadian for days to just sit around watching the stroller seniors people with disabilities should have a reduced rate because i didn t do anything that was worth the cost ,2,2018-01-27
3210,6th birthday celebration,first thing you need to do is download the disneyland app and get maxpass it s the new digital form of fastpass and will enable you to get fast passes without having to actually go to the ride to get them saves time worth every penny it s per pass the second you get into the park and your tickets are scanned you can start using it you will use your phone as your maxpass to scan when you enter the ride also fyi this will drain your cell battery so have a backup battery or carry a portable charger definitely utilize the maxpass so you aren t wasting time just walking around the park in height is the magic number for most of disney s roller coasters big thunder star tours space mountain matterhorn is if your child is not over the height limit you can utilize the rider switch pass just tell a cast member that you need one and then one parent can go on ride with a child and then switch with your friend or spouse once they return without waiting in line there are multiple parades over the day and seating fills up quickly it goes from small world to down main street and most people try to sit down main street the right side of the castle in between matterhorn and alice in wonderland better viewing and doesn t fill up as quickly at the entrance there are park maps and the daily schedule of parades as it changes everyday so be sure to grab one plus it will also be on the app the parades are exactly the same so my suggestion is to pick one to watch and then utilize the shorter lines in fantasyland during the other one upon your arrival stop by city hall right inside the entrance on the left hand side and get a birthday button and the rest of you can get i m celebrating buttons also my personal opinion the best place to see the fireworks is by the entrance in front of the train station they do projections on the store fronts down main street that you can t see unless you are further back and you get the full view of the effect that way i received all of this feedback from my friend michele and agree with her we love the park it s worth every penny if you plan your day last thing you want to do is wonder around the day goes by quick ,5,2018-01-27
3211,Wheelchair accommodations,we purchased a day park hopper for our family of and we had the best time at disney during our vacation our youngest son broke his foot a week prior to vacation and disney was very accommodating for two days we rented a wheelchair on site but found the travel from our hotel to the wheelchair rental a long way for our little guy to use his crutches we ended up renting a wheelchair from our hotel and disney had no problem with us bringing it into the park they no longer require you to get a pass for mobility issues as the wheelchair is evident enough this allowed us to get return times enter through special entrances and sometimes skip a bit of the line they try to be as fair as possible with the people who are waiting normally but in some cases we flew through the lines much faster the park is incredibly clean there is never a piece of popcorn on the ground for long as people are continuously cleaning the food and drinks in the park are insanely expensive but of course we ate them there is a snack cart or a beverage stand or a restaurant around every turn it was nice we never really had to search for food or washrooms as they are all over the place unfortunately the water rides were closed as this is their downtime so we never got those but everything else was great download the app and take advantage of the info on there also everyone there is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable the popcorn cart employee knew exactly where the next churro stand was so my boy could get the treat he was eyeing everyone will stop to help and answer questions it truly is the most magical place to be and we recommend the five day hopper so you can take in all that disney has to offer ,5,2018-01-24
3212,Disney Magic But With A Caveat,first off i am a huge disney fan and for me it has such roots in the anaheim area and with walt disney s original vision that it is a must see i visited on a monday toward the end of january and it was extremely busy i think it s similar to tokyo disney in that it has a very densely populated area with lots of ap holder s who are willing to take the day off or take advantage of goverment shutdown and spend time at disney the park did handle the numbers well however it does make the whole experience more stressful especially when you don t expect it the park itself is a blend of the classic disney rides from alice in wonderland through to buzz lightyears s astro blasters set into well laid out zones which are all very distinctive there are a good range of restaurants both sit down and counter service however i would definitely make a reservation if you re looking at one of the waiter service restaurants i was disappointed in the gift shops as there wasn t really anything special that was different i thought especially with it being the original disney park they would make more of that rather than standard gift shop fare you can find in paris or hong kong i think ultimately for me disney will always give you a day out that s different and special however i think this park has lost its way a little bit and for that reason i would probably head to knott s berry farm instead for my next visit ,3,2018-01-23
3213,WOW,omg disney was just everything i had imagined when i was a kid so glad i got to take my children and experience the magic of disneyland from the moment you walk into the gates from the moment you leave it makes you feel like you have entered another world,5,2018-01-22
3214,Huh! Tired to death but a day to remember,our iphone app showed we walked almost miles on the day we were in disneyland phew didn t feel so all day that says it all we were there on the th of december you can imagine the crowd situation had to wade through the crowds almost all day from the time we entered till the late night we left from there a few things we tried and learnt there are several restaurants in mile distance we took a lyft taxi just for had a proper dinner and went back to disney that was a good hr break and amazing food compared to the fast food and expensive ones at disney more so the waiting time only draw back is the walking to the main entrance but it is worth the effort pack some good snacks especially if you re there with kids they did allow our food items although we had read a few reviews saying outside food would not be allowed we did have a few sandwiches cookies and a little rice this was handy to have some quick bites in between rides when we anyway knew we would be waiting in the queue make sure you carry a battery power bank for the phone we need to keep checking the disney app for fast pass times for many rides often make sure you have the disney app installed on multiple phones and use the same login so your fast passes are available on multiple phones this would be handy as a back up plan when one phone is dead we didn t have much time to plan in advance but a little bit of research and watching videos in advance would have helped in zeroing in on the top rides we didn t have time for indiana jones the wait time was almost to hours for most of the time had we known in advance we would have probably gone there in the morning splash mountain is top of the rank for my family my older daughter and i did this three times it s such a fun you will be very wet if you are on the front seat better carry some ponchos our ponchos were very helpful in keeping the backpacks and purses from getting wet we didn t care so much about ourselves getting wet so much there is a special light show in the night for this one we need to get physical tickets even if you have the fast pass i didn t know that before these tickets help you have front seats with better view we ended up standing at the far end and watching it but it was very difficult my wife and i had to hold up our kids so they have a better view the lighting show on the castle is way too good please don t miss this this is open to all make sure you are aware of the show timings on that day and plan to be there well in advance lastly arrive early take breaks stay till late evening if you are concerned kids will be tired and you may not be able to stay longer don t be we are a good example we were there early and retuned to the hotel at midnight take it easy enjoy i am sure we will go back to disney in a few years ,5,2018-01-22
3215,Small but nice,love disneyland walt s first resort it is smaller than disney world but offers so many nice features rides are different than disney world my biggest complaint is food in diowntown disney is expensive i know it s disney but my selection is limited outside park love th indiana jones ride and pirates is really cooler than disney world i think everyone must go to disneyland ,4,2018-01-22
3216,Super crowded Disneyland,what can we say about this place that has not been said before it s was crowded during christmas and the fireworks was canceled due to winds what a let down the rides in line were up to hours and if you want peace and quiet this is not the place during christmas avoid it at all cost ,3,2018-01-21
3217,Used to be the happiest place on earth...,i used to love disneyland i have taken my family to disneyland every year for about the past years it used to feel like the happiest place on earth not anymore our first day at disneyland i spent hours trying to park at disneyland then when my family goes to get into the park disneyland closed the gate next to us as we are next to go in and tell the or so people next to us to get in line in front of us even though we were next we visited california adventures we were able to go on all the rides that were open the first day i bought a day pass this time park per day which we wasted half of our st day trying to park it seems like half the rides are closed at disneyland land and california adventures while i new most of the rides were closed when we went it made the parks really crowded we stood in line to see captain america and again we were next in line to see him and they allowed some other guests not in line to walk up and see him before us i m guessing they had some kind of vip status i guess if you are rich you are treated better at disneyland now we went to disneyland the next day the crowds were out of control the lines seemed ridiculous for being january midweek just wondering what we are paying for these days the park still seemed pretty clean i was super disappointed that you now have to have a fast pass to see the fantasmic show it used to be my favorite but we missed it this trip because i didn t know they now had a fast pass for that too like a lot of others i also agree that disneyland is falling apart and no longer tries to make everyone have a great experience ,2,2018-01-20
3218,5 day visit,disneyland is great apart from it being rediculously expensive the staff do a pretty great job of making sure your visit is a happy one they clean the park constantly it s amazing how they keep up the food is decent although very pricey they make sure the kids get fruit veggies and other drinks besides soda with their meals which i really appreciated the rides are outstanding and although you have to wait so long for some there is always something to look at in the lines the front gate entrance was an issue almost every morning i feel they would move a lot faster if they separated those who had already had their pictures taken from those who were visiting for the first time taking pictures for a family of or more requires a lot of time they could have staff walking through the line weeding out those who need pictures and putting it in the system while we wait as opposed to just letting it all happen at the entrance which is so time consuming and holds up the line especially for those who have their pictures linked to the their tickets and are eagerly waiting to start their day always room for improvement in some areas such as this hopefully they can find a way to fix this ,4,2018-01-20
3219,My Love for Disneyland is Gone,we used to be season pass holders and we are not from california i see it progressively declining with each visit bit this last one was the worst not only are the prices for everything from parking to horrible food ridiculous bit the cast members have lost their magic we had multiple rude cast members this time we were going to upgrade our tickets to add more days bit after this experience no thanks ,2,2018-01-20
3220,Crowed and crowed,great to see but new years eve was over crowed and not at all an enjoyable experience could not see whole park at crowd was treated like traffic and you had to follow path crowd to get anywhere ,4,2018-01-18
3221,Disneyland has some upgrades since our last visit!,spent one day on a wed the park was busy but since we planned our day we got in all of our favorite rides and attractions in minutes or less we got fast passes for rides such as indiana jones star wars matterhorn bobsleds space mountain etc since we had several adults in our party we took turns getting the fast passes and while they went the rest of us would go in smaller rides we were happy to experience disneyland with a group of people our group had young children yr olds as well as teenagers and we enjoyed all the rides together the only rides that we couldn t ride with our yr old were indiana jones and space mountain because she is inches tall and kids need to be at least to ride it all the other rides required a minimum of inches star wars is much improved since last i remember included stuff from rogue one etc we purchased tickets at target com with a discount but also found out that if you live in southern california sometimes there is special offers also we saved money by bringing our own snacks as long as you don t have any glass containers you can bring anything into the park that you can carry in your stroller and or backpacks ,5,2018-01-14
3222,Wish events were posted online when buyinmg tickets,travel on a weekend when apparently there were several special events happening which we had no idea about and would have like to avoid we purchased our tickets on disney parks website and wish there was a listing of the events when we chose dates park food is costly and really is not that great glad we brought in water and snacks in a backpack i really appreciated the security check going into the park unfortunately most people aren t prepared so getting through takes substantial time so arrive extra early to get through security castmembers are not as cheery and friendly as in years past sucks that disney parks are not supporting their employees like they use to and it is showing ,4,2018-01-13
3223,Vacation,disneyland was great the first day even though it was raining kept the crowds down and we were able to get on a lot of rides with minimal wait the next two days were very crowded even though it was supposed to be the off season i know disney wants needs to bring in maximum revenue but how great would it be if the put a cap on the number of people allowed in it was just a sea of people trying to move around not that this is going to keep us away but it might improve everyone s experience still a fantastic time ,4,2018-01-13
3224,Great Place but Beware the Vouchers,we learned the hard way about the difference between vouchers and tickets we bought a voucher through expedia with a ticket you go directly to the short turnstile lineup with a voucher at least the one we got we had to first go through the same line up as walk up guests to get a ticket we waited minutes high season in that line expedia didn t warn us about this risk i would have given anything to have had this info beforehand so we could have bought a different type of ticket otherwise great experience as always ,3,2018-01-09
3225,Happiest?,having been to disneyland numerous times throughout my lifetime i noticed a big difference this trip whereas disneyland s staff has always been a huge part of what made it the happiest place on earth that no longer seems to be the case we stood in numerous lines prior to getting into the park each manned by slow moving employees upon entering the park we handed our tickets to an older woman who did not make eye contact greet us or smile likewise the young woman at it s a small world did not smile nor greet us and had a look on her face that said i would rather be anywhere but here the park which has always had a reputation for cleanliness was no longer so clean we encountered a dirty diaper on the walkway and old gum on sidewalks along the entrance granted there were still employees willing to go out of their way to accommodate requests which was nice to see it was disappointing however to see several people working there who appeared to be anything but happy ,3,2018-01-09
3226,Rides shut down during hot summer days,we had an unprecedented terrible time at disneyland on august st we have been to disneyland nearly every year growing up in california and for the last years with our children on this trip some of the most popular rides including splash mountain haunted house and other rides were closed the weather was hot and though we would normally go on some of the rides to cool off there was no relief in site we decided to go on another favorite the indiana jones adventure only to have it break down and have everyone sitting in line waiting for them to figure it out it took over an hour to get through and the disney crew was dismissive like it was normal and no big deal to top it off the experience with staff demeanor was far from the happiest place on earth it appears the place has been taken over by people that would rather not be working and could care less about customers the workers at splash mountain said you can t go here the ride is closed indefinitely are the millennials taking over disney management no matter the reason we cannot see making another trip to disneyland especially after shelling out the ridiculous cost of tickets each not to mention the cost of everything once you re inside the park it is not worth the price ,2,2018-01-07
3227,Really?,the happiest place on earth really they allow too many people into the park so many that you can t even walk hour waits for rides seems like very poor management the thing that really made this particular trip a bad experience was the bathrooms a person should not have to clean a toilet so that they can use it especially after paying tons of money for the privilege i found the staff to be particularly brusque once again i paid tons of money to be there staff should be polite and professional if i ever return to disneyland it will be against my will ,2,2018-01-06
3228,More time to spend in lines then to enjoy and be happy,if your idea of vacation and happiness is spending more time standing in lines then anything else then disney is the place to be ,2,2018-01-05
3229,Disneyland,for the price that we paid to get in the crowds and the lines were not worth the cost of the ticket unfortunately this is the only vacation time where both kids had a simultaneous break from school since my daughter could not walk around all day and night we had to rent a wheelchair i was surprised at how much it was to rent one because if you have a temporary or permanent disability i was surprised that those with a disability had to pay and also go to a busy ride to get a return time or get one fast pass at a time it was hard on us who had to escort her pushing a wheelchair back and forth the food snacks and drinks still need improvement for the price that you have to pay the fireworks show was spectacular the cars ride was closed we tried to stand in line for rides that we missed on our very first trip ,3,2018-01-05
3230,Happiest Place on Earth,if you plan your day well you can cover so many rides this place is magnificent at night the staff are very accommodating and happy a must for young and old ,5,2018-01-03
3231,Great fun and family time,we had a ball worriesd it might be to busy as we were there between christmas and ny but is was fine busy but no more than expected our kids are teens so we used the single rider lines never waited longer than half an hour you ll need to do some research to find out which rides have them and ask were the lines are we also used fast pass paid the extra ticket to do it thru the app well worth it we took lunch with us rolls from local store but brought dinner inside the price wasnt to bad about each for chicken pot roast or pasta dish ,5,2018-01-02
3232,Dreamland- Disney,background we are a family of with year old twins and a tween went during the busiest time of the year between christmas and new year for days we loved it must do fantasmic get fastpass in front of mark twain in frontierland early in the morning its an amazing experience the good maxpass is the savior you can book fastpass from your mobile we could do a lot of attractions because of this concept otherwise the lines are long and tiring for kids the rides were great and were available for all ages best ones for us were nemo sub space mountain splash mountain mad tea party matterhorn bob sled jungle cruise pirates of the caribbean indiana jones and many more the bad the stroller rental can be kept inside the entrance it wastes a lot of time since you have to rent it outside and miss the queue the car park is too far away to walk even if you have to take the tram they can do better planning food is very expensive inside the park try macaroons at jolly holiday bakery the ugly we had power failure for hours in the noon loosing valuable time most of the rides were halted disney neither reumbursed the tickets nor compensated even after booking big thunder mountain in fastpass the attraction suddenly decides that its not avialable it happend to us couple of times and wasted our schedule and we could never do it meet mickey late evening was a disaster even after waiting in the queue for hours we were told that it will take an hour more so we had to get off the line disney can put wait time for these attractions as well the maxpass app is buggy and keeps crashing and doesnt load the fastpass at times the disney app should provide a list of wait times for all attractions right now they show it on a map which is difficult to a get a snapshot suggestions get to the park hour early before the start time there will be queue in the parking lot at the tram and at the entrance stay close to the park which saves you commute time leverage magic morning as this is when you can do some of the attractions whose wait times are longer leave park early and come back for fireworks and fantasmic late evening ,4,2017-12-30
3233,Disneyland is beautiful at Christmas!,disneyland is a beautiful place to visit at christmas time the cast members are friendly the park is clean and the decorations are great the rides are fun and as a larger person it s great because you can still ride everything other california parks only accommodate smaller individuals wait times were pretty long when we were there so use your fast passes we even tried out the max pass and decided we like it because you don t have to run all over the park to get fast passes and you can often get them sooner ,5,2017-12-29
3234,Good but priiiccceeeyyy,we live super close to the park and had an annual pass for several years but let it go because we didn t make enough use of it on this occasion we took family for a pre christmas treat we all enjoyed our day and making use of single rider lines really helped us get on all of the rides we really wanted to food options had improved since my last visit and the cast members were in general very good the only downside is the cost it is totally unacceptable to pay almost for a day park hopper ticket that meant it was just shy of for of us just to enter the parks food and drinks were extra and this left me with a sour taste and did make me think long and hard about whether i would go again in the future ,4,2017-12-29
3235,Always so much fun!,truly magical at disney during the most wonderful time of the year all the christmas decorations made the park more festive always more crowded than disney ca adventure but we still had a great time ,5,2017-12-26
3236,Magical Christmas at Disneyland,we were two jaded stressed out parents with a teenager with a mobile phone constantly in use until we entered disneyland then the transformation began who can fail to enjoy all the christmas decorations songs and costumes of the main street a truly magical place we smiled in the tikki hut got wet on the river cruise enjoyed the new version of pirates of the caribbean rode on the matterhorn indiana temple of doom we ate churros candy floss cotton candy as the christmas parade went by sorry to our dentist we were mesmorised by the parades and we spun dizzily on the teacups we sang it s a small world along with all the figures on the ride we found nemo and we found fun and laughter again as a family with a teenager who put her phone away christmas is truly magical in disneyland yes it s crowded definately not cheap but we left exhausted a happy family that searched the night skies for tinkerbelle ,5,2017-12-23
3237,"Good, bad and sometimes ugly!",i ve been visiting disneyland since i still had a good time but it was really important to make effective use of the fastpass system we had a four day pass and still didn t see everything mainly because of the crowds on two days we got lucky and were able to access rides reasonably easily the other two days though were close to hell on earth there were so many people i really wish the authorities would impose a realistic cap on the number of people who are allowed in at any given time still overall i m glad that we made the effort ,3,2017-12-21
3238,"Long lines, but worth it.",everyone knows disneyland has long lines but if you spend all day and use their fastpass option you will have a fun filled day to remember we bought our tickets online directly from disneyland mainly because there were no discounts available from anywhere else not even costco or aaa parking was but that s to be expected you can upgrade to preferred parking at the gate but that only gets you closer to an elevator we walked the entire park a few times in about a nine hour visit the fastpass is a system that allows you to check in at a ride and return for your designated window that it assigns you we checked into the haunted house at around and had to return no earlier than roughly you can only get one fastpass every hours so at we got a fastpass to get on the matterhorn at around people who didn t utilize the fastpass system were in line for to minutes for most of the big rides there was no extra cost to use the fastpass system make reservations at one of their restaurants otherwise you ll stand in line for a turkey leg or burger we couldn t find a hot dog stand anywhere the nighttime laser light fantasy show and fireworks show are spectacular during the holidays there are christmas lights everywhere ,5,2017-12-14
3239,Still the happiest place on Earth!,we went for the first time in years and it had just as much magic as i remember from the last time it was neat to see the improvements to the pirates of the carribean and some of the other rides the stores had some fantastic merchandise too the only reason why i didn t give it stars is because it s just so expensive i expect to pay a lot for the merchandise but for a corndog is just a bit silly ,4,2017-12-13
3240,Happiest Place on Earth!,visited with a year old and year old and had help with a year old best to get a photo pass to get some professional photos you can view all in one place throughout the day my favorite thing is taking the photo with tinkerbell at the walt disney statue cutest thing ever try to plan your day and fast pass or do your reservation for rides on disney app it s per person but you can get to more rides in a day go to farthest ride away and work your way back lots of walking the traction is gets ears hat with your name embroidered also you can trade pins with any cast member wearing them it s a lot of fun if you are a collector be sure to get a pin if it s your birthday or st visit be sure to plan ahead with reservations for dinner if you want to eat by pirates if the caribbean lots of shops inside but try to remember that kids get tired and it doesn t do any good yelling at them it s about the kids and making their day memorable lots of characters for photo ops and parades so check the schedules have fun ,5,2017-12-08
3241,Fun but too expensive,disneyland is great if you re a billionaire it s all about the experience i get that but i wouldn t come more then once a year yesterday i went with my boyfriend and between the tickets about and the drinks and food we got at the bars and restaurants we must have soent about dollars on our day trip to disneyland all in all the experience was great but like i said way too expensive ,3,2017-12-07
3242,How to Disney,here is how to do disneyland you have to go early like min before the park opens you are going to need to grab a fast pass for fantasmic river bell dock are in the morning sometime unless you ordered dinner fanstasmic seating you can ride almost all the major rides before and then leave for lunch because the afternoon is meyham afternoon everyone else shows up and the people who have been there since morning are starting to get irritable snag a fast pass for a ride like space mountain that will have a late return time come back in the evening well rested we tried out the new maxpass and it was great we loved that you could cancel and reschedule fast passes from your phone another cool feature is from time to time you can grab an earlier fast pass appointment probably because someone else cancels be sure not to miss out on tom sawyers island and if you are patriotic great moments with mr lincoln ,5,2017-12-02
3243,"Seriously, folks, it's Disneyland...",the prices are ridiculous and the crowds are horrendous although the fastpass system really helps with that but it s disneyland we hadn t been there in over years and decided to go realizing we d probably never return three day passes disney hotel etc it cost as much as some of our trips to europe no regrets not going back although disneyworld is still on my list but we re glad we went the christmas decorations were up and it really helped me get into the christmas spirit ,4,2017-11-30
3244,Magical Place,always such a magical place to visit with family we love coming during the holidays it is becoming harder and harder to find non busy weekend ,5,2017-11-27
3245,Great place for young and old,my second visit still as fun n happy disappointed by the breakdown of rodney ride and huanted house extremely disappointed that the firework at the castle was cancelled due to strong wind i didn t get to watch the fireworks show the other time for the same reason ,3,2017-11-27
3246,Disneyland,my first time here it s great i love this park we did a one day park hopper we went to california adventures it s really nice and also disneyland we rode a lot of rides cars land was so much fun you really need or days to see everything max pass was great extra to get all your pictures i will do a separate review of our dining experience but overall it s a great park ,5,2017-11-23
3247,Disney was magical but very busy.,my family and i visited disneyland during the middle of november we stayed within walking distance to the park which i definitely recommend doing we had a day pass and utilised this by visiting disneyland the first day california park the seo nd day and then went between both on the third and forth day going back on the rides we enjoyed the most the maxpass app was a savour in disney we used this for days being there and managed to go on most of the rides including the larger ones with a maximum wait time of minutes this app was also convenient to be able to see wait times of rides and navigate through the park the other great benefit of the maxpass was the ability to download photos for free through the app our family got many professional photos and photos with the characters and downloaded these to our photos straight away i would not visit disney without the maxpass app unless you are willing to wait hours for some rides i would not recommend eating in the park unless you book prior online for restaurants etc as there is long wait times for eateries also and it is expensive in the park disneyland is such a magical place and for children it is beautiful be aware it is crowded and can be hard to get around at certain times of the day ,4,2017-11-23
3248,Service has gone down.,we have been to disneyland many of times this place holds a very special place in my heart as it is where i got engaged we recently went on november the workers are no longer smiling and no longer giving their great customer service one worker was the attendant to see frozen characters once i noticed him should have gotten his name i started noticing more unhappy workers guardians of the galaxy ride food vendors and ariels groto waiters very disappointing do something about this disney we shouldn t have grouchy and grumpy workers who do not love their jobs it should be the happiest place on earth and i would love to continue to think so ,4,2017-11-22
3249,No need to give it a title..,nice place and theme park kids loved it but there is a lot to walk especially if you are planning to cover the park in one day don t take selfie stick for taking picture they don t allow it they will either trash it or will ask you to put it back in your hotel or car strange ,4,2017-11-21
3250,Because I'm Happy at the most happiest place on earth!,christmas was in full swing lights decorations trees parade i like pirates fantasmic and haunted mansion better here versus wdw haunted mansion is re themed in nightmare before christmas it s a small world was lit up for christmas veterans day was recognized and they played the anthem for each service nightly service to take down the american flag i love disney ,5,2017-11-18
3251,Disneyland water problem,it was on nbc news that disneyland water storage has legionairs disease i would suggest disney world if you don t want the disease ,1,2017-11-14
3252,Great vacation,celebrated our anniversary and my birthday at disney had a great time halloween is a good time to visit the park ,5,2017-11-11
3253,Overpriced,it s not summer vacation or christmas time but crowds and lines are everywhere and the waiting time is over mins on average however we have to pay full price the queues in fact reflect a shortage of the facilities and the guests of the park cannot get the service they deserve on time what upset us the most is the little world is not opened yet the shops keep open n give us the impression that the park intends to take money out of the guests pocket this is the second time we ve come but is definitely worse than the first time that was less queues and crowded ,2,2017-11-10
3254,Our experience,we recently went to disneyland and it was just magical we were there for halloween and done the trick or treat nights we got so much candy we ended up leaving it behind as couldn t fit anymore in our luggage i have to say disneyland was one of the most cleanest places i ve ever went to everything was neat and tidy food prices were abit expensive but average for these type of places security was over the top but made us all feel very safe good job the rides were fantastic two downfalls my sons hat flew off on a ride we could see the hat and it was within reach of the stairs were told we weren t allowed to get it staff would get it for us after the ride closed we went back at pm to be told no you will have to wait and it will be at the townhall in the morning went to townhall to be told it will be at lost and found we went back on different occasions and nothing clearly a staff member threw the hat out second one was we brought a day disneyland park hopper pass which yes my fault i didn t read that it expires days after first use but given that we paid for the full days i didn t even realise there was an expiry i think having an expiry on something you paid a lot of money for is crap disneyland needs to remove this expiry once i realised this i found out we were going to lose a whole day went to the ticket box to be told sorry nothing we can do you will have to upgrade to a annual pass at for the three of us not happy went over to the guest services area and explained the situation and was told the exact same thing by a very unapologetic lady who kept shrugging her shoulders at me and making me feel less of a person then her i asked to speak to a manager i wish i knew the managers name because he was a rude arrogant man who really needs to be removed as management and the face of the company he wasn t understanding at all nor sympathetic towards me he keep pointing to the expiry date and repeating himself over and over again refused to give us the extra day we paid for and told me too bad you should have read the fine print i also told him how lost and found lost my sons hat to which he replied well your child needs to leave to take care of his stuff we knew exactly were the hat was but the staff lost it we ended up going into townhall and re explained our situation for the third time and were met with much sympathy and the lady happily gave us our th day no questions asked this was on the wednesday st of november at about am ,3,2017-11-08
3255,Such a Fun Evening in Disneyland!,traveled for business recently decided to spend the evening at disneyland i was lucky enough to meet someone from the hotel on the shuttle who was traveling alone until her friends came in the next day she was kind enough to ask me if i would like to join her in a tour of the park i would have wasted so much time figuring things out without her thanks reagan i have visited disneyworld several times but never disneyland i was amazed at how much smaller but easier to navigate it is we got to rides quickly and even used the single rider lanes to save time in lines it worked out great as always i loved every ride we got on i had not seen the improvements made to pirates of the carribean or haunted mansion during the holidays so both were fun to ride we ate dinner near the lagoon or lake area while the fantasmic show was happening awesome disney is absolutely the happiest place on earth and has hospitality down to a science you can just see the joy on folks faces and i wore my astros world series champions t shirt and many in the park commented on what a great series the dodgers and astros played very class act i will definitely bring the grandkids back for a real disneyland adventure the quick trip just convinced me i need to ,5,2017-11-05
3256,best tips for real budgets - places to eat; time to go; place to stay; best rides,best places to eat for real budgets is zocalo you can get an honest a gosh decent meal there for a reasonable price when compared with a restaurant outside the park is the golden horseshoe it s okay for the money and you can get a show if you time your meal correctly plus the ice cream is priced best at the gh compared with the rest of the park is the plaza inn it s not as good a value but the chicken is spot on and generously portioned best place to stay for a real budget hands down it s stovalls best time to visit i d pick spring summer or early fall to visit seems like every day is crowded but the middle of the week during school terms would be the best choice i d avoid the winter we visited over president s day weekend unfortunately a lot of attractions were closed because of the new star wars area construction or were undergoing maintenance on top of that rain fell for most of the time we were there which closed even more rides the take away was avoid february best time of year for value it s definitely not the winter for the reasons mentioned from our experience i d shoot for late autumn or mid spring those two times will likely be the best for hotels and motels around the park best value for a theme park well it s still a class act however the cost is getting prohibitive tickets food etc particularly if you stay at a park resort note there are definite advantages to staying at a park resort early hours proximity but you ll pay a huge premium this trip certainly wasn t worth the money because of the closed rides best attractions as someone who remembers what disney was like in the s the charm s evaporated tomorrowland used to be a place of wonder at new technology and scientific discoveries i miss the carousel of progress journey into inner space and the like i particularly miss the people mover the best rides remain the oldest there s no wonder involved with the long lines then in fantasyland for peter pan storybook boats mr toad s wild ride and alice they re still outstanding all these years later and jungle boat ride is still awesome with the best puns in the park splash mountain is probably the best of all the rides its mixture of animatronics and a water ride are an unbeatable combination and it s long the haunted mansion is still an amazing execution and oh do i miss paul freeh s voice my favorite of all the one that captures the essence of the old park as it s essentially unchanged is the tiki room go sing w the birds you won t regret it really you ve got to sing don t be shy tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet my wife thinks i m nuts but every time i watch that show i m transported to the five year old watching one of the most technologically advanced and charming shows in the world being thoroughly enchanted and so will you ,3,2017-11-04
3257,Too crowded,the california side needs more shade they also should allow more fast passes and be need to become diligent in regards to the amount of ppl who hold space in line person will hold the space and after min or so they text their on average rude family members or friends to join them and cut in line this was a huge problem esp in oct during the halloween crowds a ton of ppl felt as we did and were infuriated at the lack of respect a lot of the park goers had as they just acted like cutting in line holding spaces same thing inviting others you know to line jump was perfectly within their rights there s no words i can print here for how i as well as a lot of others we spoke to in lines these last days at the disney parks felt about these classless jerks and the worst part is they are for the most part something s doing this an age group who all should know better we were talking about how anytime this happens we will take pictures of the offending line jumpers holders and post them on the various social media sites to call them out ,3,2017-10-28
3258,Magical day out!,it was our first time here and we loved it we got there as the park opened and the lines were massive but they moved quickly the park was beautiful and the rides and attractions are fantastic disney manages the crowds so well and the longest we waited was for one ride for minutes everything else was less than half an hour it was a lovely day out the food was great and the staff were lovely it s quite expensive once inside and also to purchase tickets but it s disneyland so what do you expect my fiance and i are a couple with no children yet but the park proves you are never too old to feel the magic of disney ,4,2017-10-28
3259,It Is Called the Happiest Place on Earth for a Reason,i didn t go to disneyland for the first time until my early s and years later i still love going there it is interesting to see it through the grandchildren s eyes the classics are still a pleasure to see such as pirates of the caribbean the haunted house and of course the kids attractions in fantastic land yes it s a small world is still annoying the parades and fireworks are great this time of year use to be a slow time of year but now with all of the halloween celebrations at the park it is a busy time of year we also went to one of the halloween party celebration nights which as a great experience you do have to get tickets early because they do sell out ,5,2017-10-20
3260,Warmer than I expected,it was our first visit but won t be our last i took my grandson and we both had a wonderful time enjoying all things disney i was hoping for cooler weather but it was very warm during the day in the parks ,5,2017-10-20
3261,Birthday Celebration!,we went to disneyland celebration to celebrate my great nephew s th birthday he wanted to have breakfast with minnie and friends it s at the plaza restaurant it s a buffet and the food is delicious but the main attraction is the characters come into the dining area and take pictures not only with the kids but with adults as well it is so cool to see the expressions on these kids faces priceless ,5,2017-10-18
3262,Great time,we went to d land on a tuesday during school hours the park had a very light crowd this allowed us to get on rides with small lines the kids had a blast and we adults too our favorite ride was indiana jones take my advice let your kids skip school one day in their lives and go to d land you will be a hero ,5,2017-10-17
3263,Too Crowded if you go on Halloween time,i went to disneyland at halloween season because i had a concert in that dats in pasadena i made the most if my trip by going to disneyland and disney california adventure with a park hopper day pass the experience is great if you arrive early but soon it becomes really packed and it is almost impossible for you to walk since it s full of strolls try to avoid going to disneyland in these dates except if you re attending to mickey s halloween party if you have small babies better wait until they grow up because it s going to be really exhausting for you and the strolls hinder the traffic when walking inside the parks the attractions as always are amazing specially the haunted mansion which is themed as the nightmare before christmas and also the new guardians of the galaxy tower is great ,3,2017-10-11
3264,Fun and disappointing at the same time,this was my first time back since about it was fun but after having been to disney world in florida disneyland isn t on the same level i was surprised to find many of the attractions unchanged since my last visit over years ago one change i didn t appreciate was the excessive altering of the haunted mansion the changes for halloween seriously degraded the experience recommendation if you ve been to disney world you probably won t enjoy disneyland on the same level if you haven t been to disney world then it s a great place to visit ,4,2017-10-10
3265,The least friendly Disney yet.,this is the rd disney resort we have visited and it was the worst of the compared to paris and orlando the staff in anaheim could do with some pr training they aren t very helpful or even approachable the amount of rides that broke down throughout our visit was incredible all of them were temporarily closed at some point making it very hard to make full use of the park splash mountain is awesome though ,3,2017-10-09
3266,Great day in the park,we just spent three days here with our year old she had a wonderful time and did not want to go home the characters were fantastic and even when they have to take a break they wave and are still friendly to the kids as they are leaving wait times for rides were not bad but we were there midweek which helps the park is exceptionally clean and staff are nice and very helpful the price of admission is expensive but they truly seem to make an effort to make the experience worth your money we will be back ,5,2017-10-07
3267,"Fun, but crowded",our son j really enjoyed the park however the rest of out family realised that season in our lives have changed if i need an adrenaline rush perhaps running with the bulls may be a better option in future even for a non peak season it was still very much crowded which one should consider if one want to visit disneyland ,3,2017-10-06
3268,An Old Guy's Disneyland Trip,for me disneyland was a must for me at least once in my lifetime as a child i watched walt disney s disneyland on tv every wednesday night in black and white it was on in the s and even when it moved to sunday nights there really is something magical here and it s immediately felt once you have walked onto main street something really noticeable thing was the security presence very much in evidence from the walkway leading to the entrance a physical search of bags then to the metal detectors you re now made to pass through the lines to get in were long in the morning and we went on tuesday september th and managed to get in the park within minutes after when they opened this is mainly due to not purchasing our entrance tickets in advance you never have to worry about going hungry here there are food and drinks around every corner the rides aren t extreme but are so much fun and very family friendly one thing i must say is disneyland is overcrowded way overcrowded no matter where we went in the park it was just filled with people yes there might be days where the park was not as crowded and i was told that usually that means you wait minutes in line for a ride instead of minutes definitely come here with a plan of attack or you will waste so much time in lines as most amusement parks everything was overpriced the park entrance sights and rides were worth for an old guy that wanted to see and experience disneyland since i was a kid in the s but meals were not we did purchase of the mickey pretzels for over each mine was not quite baked and was a little doughy in the eye area bring your own water and or snacks sunscreen and a hat i wanted to give disneyland the highest rating but due to no guidance or instructions available to enter the park and the crowds of people and strollers i could not i loved the main street with it s buildings and the rides and sights throughout the park i understand the lines aren t bad if you go in the off season but the food and souvenirs are so expensive i know it s to be expected but it d be nice to have more inexpensive options disneyland is really something everyone should experience if they have the ability to do so it s so much fun and nearly impossible not to find your inner child set free the entire time you re here we started off on main street and ended the day on main street and hit my favorite rides first the disneyland railroad then to my wife s favorite the haunted mansion we did the pirates of the caribbean later in the day after walking the park and taking in the original rides and activities it was pretty busy so we waited about min for each ride but the line was consistently moving so it wasn t bad living by pikes peak the matterhorn seamed very small to me i highly recommend getting a hotel nearby we stayed at the holiday inn and suites and used the low cost art shuttle to and from the park the art pass cost per day for age and over senior reduced costs are per day for years plus catch me on a bad day and i might say disneyland is overrated with to many upset kids with whining and screaming parents filled with way to much sugar ,4,2017-10-05
3269,Still has the Disney magic,i was apprehensive returning to the original disney years after our last visit however there was no need to be cm s still share that disney magic all rides were in operation and the night shows were magnificent i preferred the way the fast pass can be booked on your phone now and definitely preferred this over the disney paris method ,5,2017-10-04
3270,Delightful Disneyland Park,it was as awesome as expected however it didnt go as smoothly as our california adventure visit numerous rides shut down inconveniently during long waits even though we had disney app fast passes we were not credited multi experience replacement pass instantly as we should have been and i had to request it at a station in city hall this wasted apprx hours of our day since both space mountain splash mountain and indiana jones broke down on us other than those mishaps it was the funnest day of meet and greets good eats and magical rides my family loved the matterhorn its a small world and star tours i definitely recommend utilizing the fast pass on the app complete w gps direction to each ride so easy just pack a separate camera since your cell s battery will get drained quicker than normal or designate one parent or person to take photos while the other uses the disney app it really is the most magical place on earth ,4,2017-10-03
3271,It's Disney,pack your food everything is horribly expensive they also have very few water fountains but charge for a oz bottle of water the lines get long spend the money for the max pass totally worth it i ll never do disneyland on a weekend again the mass of humans is too much and don t expect any kindness while you try to maneuver your stroller people literally don t care you ll get slammed into repeatedly without so much as an excuse me is what it is i guess when you have people smashed into acres of space that being said its disneyland it s the happiest most bankrupting place on earth and everyone should go at least once ,4,2017-10-01
3272,Magical,a bit of a dream come true from childhood wonderful adventures and great staff throughout the park you will need comfy shoes but there is mobility scooter hire available if your feet pack it in while your exploring thoroughly recommend fast passes to avoid long line up times disney train is well worth a look and the monorail to help you get around a bit more too star wars fans might like to check out star tours ride shop at the end of the ride where you can construct your own light saber and the area where you can get photos with characters ,5,2017-10-01
3273,Robynne Penrith,it really is the happiest place on earth we were lucky we wnt midweek in early september and the lines werent too bad,5,2017-09-28
3274,Excellent,now my favourite disney this disney is great rides were so different to florida the fact you can walk between the parks is a major bonus with the kids so much to do even for kids like my year old who doesn t like rides so much to do all cast members friendly and helpful cant wait to return,5,2017-09-28
3275,Always an amazing trip,we love going to disney and would go all the time if we didn t live hours away in the uk could not possibly pick our favourites but this time we used the max pass system it was a godsend the park was moderately busy but nothing like how it sometimes is so we thought lets go for it we got on every ride we wanted to minus all the walking back and forth to each ride and each park would buy it again ,5,2017-09-27
3276,World of Colour Fabulous!! - Tickets from Carthay Circle Restaurant was a rip off,we booked our trip last minute and scrambled to make dining reservations to ensure we could view the world of colour which we had heard was a must see we obtained a dinner reservation at carthay circle with tickets to world of colour service was terrible there were the only table occupied in the back dining room and a second group of somethings arrived and were seated next to us we have already placed our order and had received our starters as soon as these other guests people from the kitchen rushed out to talk to them arguments ensued of wine pairings and generally a noisy ruckus next to us they received appetizers salads entrees and were ordering dessert before we got our entree we had ordered steaks and they were luke warm certainly not up to the typical standard of disney our server never returned to our table to see if we enjoying our meal or if we needed anything so we ate cold steak once we were done she came back and served our dessert i know the server was not happy that we did not order alcoholic beverages just by the expression on her face low bill low tip so she pretty much abandoned us the price of the meal exceeded the quality by a long shot when we were presented with out tickets after paying our bill we were told we would be seated in the best area close to the front yay arrived early to ensure the little one could watch without having to look over or around adults and were held behind a rope and told that we had to have purchased a ticket for each to be seated near the front really what a surprize after paying for our dinner and we see all these people moving into the seats we were told would be ours there were a few park benches placed in our section at the back but once they dropped the rope we were told that these were not for us but for people who really needed them meaning they paid more money to seating so we stood on hard concrete for another hour before the show started this is just another example of how disney corporation has put greed before their customers certainly not the disney in the past no more happy greetings or smiles on the faces of the people working there so sad so save your money get a fast pass and you will likely have a better view than we did after spending a whole lot of money for a mediocre meal ,3,2017-09-26
3277,Seems like a shoddy imitation,perhaps visiting on a halloween special day affected this but after visiting disneyworld in florida a few times i was excited to try the california park i was disappointed everything was cramped the way the queues were set up was bizarre with matterhorn in particular just sending us round in circles trying to find the end of the queue a lot of the big rides weren t even working the staff seemed bored and uninterested whereas at disneyworld they are very much actors in character and not staff that difference was very obvious we visited califonria adventure next door too which was much better save your money and just visit there instead ,2,2017-09-23
3278,"Incredibly Too Expensive, Crowded, Much to Do",incredibly too expensive crowded much to do for a family with young children there s a lot to do but disneyland is incredibly expensive you ll pay for everything from the very high cost to get in to even the outrageously expensive parking most days the crowding is enormous with long waits in lines recommendations get there at opening time plan on spending a lot on food and souvenirs take a patience pill and comfortable shoes ,3,2017-09-21
3279,Not as good as Disney world,my husband and i are avid disney fans and this was our first time visiting disneyland we were very excited to come here and enjoy the parks the food was great but i was a bit disappointed in the character interaction and didn t like that you had to chase them down to get a picture or signature and some wouldn t even stop we didn t think the cast members were not as nice as disney world i felt like i missed some of the magic it was really cool to see walts touch and visit some of his favorite places and try his foods i m not sure if we would come back but it was good for one time the app is awful wouldn t work a lot lost cell phone signal often the max pass is great though and it was work the extra per ticket per day to not have to walk around to get fast passes makes your day go by so much better i also think they should have more photopass in the park they lacked in that as well ,3,2017-09-20
3280,Magical,we ve been to disneyworld twice with young kids and loved it so this year we tried disneyland it s tough to choose a favorite because while they are both disney parks there are differences as for disneyland we found that lines were very reasonable in the first hour we rode mr toad small world tea cups and buzz lightyear before the park started to get busy even in the afternoon we waited no more than minutes for a ride and used fast pass for star wars and matterhorn so that those were just walk ons food seemed a bit more limited at disneyland when lunchtime rolled around and we had a hard time finding a sit down restaurant but with both parks you can bring in food and drinks so that will help your budget and hold you over until you can walk to food characters seemed much more available in world but lines were much shorter again in land pluto and goofy were both inside the front gate with only minute waits princess hall had minute wait with ariel snow white and cinderella in passing we saw tigger chipmunks minnie captain hook tiana and aurora but didn t see where their picture spots were located if you can get a spot on the parade route you will see them all but they do no let you linger along the route both parks are warm and finding a shady spot to sit and cool down can be tough you will get your steps in at either park although land seems a bit more compact either way you can t go wrong with a disney park they truly are the most magical places on earth for kids of all ages ,5,2017-09-18
3281,Disney is no better than six flags. Ruined by corporate exsanguination,universal will work harder to get your business disney has killed all the special things that made disneyland worth going to they have cut so many corners that six flags is competition now ,3,2017-09-17
3282,Part of a long cross-country road trip,as time visitors to disney world my year old daughter and i were excited to see the original we enjoyed the rides the ambiance comparing each park s version of the same rides and overall disney ness ,5,2017-09-17
3283,Huge fan but prices are out of hand,we love disneyland love it you know you re going to spend money when you go there but a two day park hopper pass is now per person are you frickin kidding me now if that insured better quality experiences or shorter wait lines it might be ok but disney i love ya as a long time supporter you guys are slipping food quality has gone down prices have gone up lines are longer and it seems like i keep paying more and getting less and less at the time of this review they are in the midst of adding star wars land to the park so about a quarter of the park is closed off haunted mansion closed for refurbishment and more again i love disney but if this trend continues people are going to rethink attending the park unfortunately for me i m an idiot and will keep going back so they know they have me hooked like it s black tar heroin so i doubt much will improve please give us working folks a price break disney please enough is enough ,4,2017-09-15
3284,So disappointing,as an elder couple early s we were really not sure what to expect however we did not expect the crowds nor the closed rides a few of the best rides were closed the haunted mansion space mountain pirates of the caribbean until around pm splash mountain from around pm we waited for hours to go to splash mountain only to be told it was closed for technical reasons to pay us each for the day we feel like it was a rip off the next day we went to disney california which was marginally better apparently we were not there during the busy season but refuse to wait hour minutes on a queue at least at disney california they provide shade mostly while waiting ,2,2017-09-12
3285,Amazing family trip -2 days at Disney & California Adventure,we spent maybe one of the hottest days here in disneyland the last week of august we had an amazing time when i think back to the visit what makes it so incredible is that you are totally immersed in the atmosphere disneyland creates in each separate area it feels like you are on a movie set but you actually get to interact the day we were there we noticed around noon probably due to the heat many of the fellow attendees left the park and for the most part we enjoyed very short lines to the rides we missed space mountain and the haunted mansion but we saw plenty and drank a lot of water my kids were and while the younger guy missed the height mark on a few rides he got to do plenty i suspect we ll be back again in a few years it was worth the painful ticket price we walked to the park from the springhill suites anaheim resort area convention center we used a double stroller to get around the park and while i got a good workout especially with the yo standing on the back of the stroller it helped keep the kids going all day ,5,2017-09-08
3286,Top rides were down.,we went on a sweltering day at the end of august when the kids were back in school so expected shorter lines which they were shorter than universal but many of the main attractions were closed or under repair which we weren t made aware of when purchasing tickets closed haunted house space mountain waited in line at indiana jones and had to get out after waiting awhile because it broke down fortunately we were able to go on it later the matterhorn was impossible to get in the car i am i suggested a refurbishment the miserable ride attendant said they just were done over in general most of the park employees seemed miserable with the exception of our waiter at the blue bayou which i highly recommend as a respite from the insanity of the day and the heat the max pass system is a little daunting and archaic compared to the fast pass at universal but we got the hang of it pretty quick and it was only more per ticket compared to more for universal the park in general is classic but starting to get a little dated thankfully we were able to cool off on the splash mountain log flume ride ,3,2017-09-07
3287,Great if you're under 10!,my partner and i visited disneyland park as we figured it would be a great day out in la regardless of age the park is dated and definitely geared towards children lots of shows and children s rides but not much for adults thunder mountain space mountain and haunted mansion were all closed for repairs and i d known this before i wouldn t have gone in indian jones and splash mountain had minute wait times all in all my partner and i spent just over hour there it felt like a total waste of almost per person and we will never go again ,2,2017-09-07
3288,"DisneyLand, ""Where a kid, can be a kid"" wait wrong mouse.", the happiest place on earth truly lives up to its name nostalgia from every park and ride we visited for days disneyland california adventure m th and i still feel like we still missed on a lot of things things from tomorrowland i recommend days to really experience both parks in its entirety the park hopper add on seems like a waste of money and on the other hand seems to save you money if you buy one ticket to one park and add on the park hopper you get parks at a cheaper price but you also don t get to fully enjoy each park seeing as they are both big parks another thing i would recommend is the fastpass add on to your tickets fastpass allows you to skip the general waiting line and go in another line that s straight to the ride saves a lot of time you can wait up to minutes per attraction or ride but not having the fastpass can take you away from some things for example when we waited for the roger rabbit ride in toon town you go through interactive spaces while waiting for the ride some photo opportunities next to movie props and some cool movie scenery that ll put you right into the movie some fastpass lines skip it entirely some take you thru the same spaces just at a faster pace the park allows you to bring outside food and drinks if your on a budget and don t bring any snacks from your home a walmart is conveniently located miles from disneyland at the anaheim plaza and prices are not inflated due to its location i really enjoyed this trip and both parks it is pricey but after you buy the tickets food snacks and souvenirs are the only extra things in the parks you can buy everything else comes with the ticket you bought rides are plus sized friendly the drinking water is dirty if you have some money just buy bottled water not sure if it s the park or californias water and the best ride of all is the tram home if you are staying late it comes with a price the tram takes you to and from the theme parks and at closing time you could be waiting for minutes to get on one not to mention other parents and children are tired and fed up and will rudely cut infront of you to fight for spot back to the parking lot enjoy your trip try the dole whipped ice cream grab a churro download the disneyland app makes it easier to find wait times look at your maxpass pictures that photographers take per ticket per day and even find characters ,5,2017-09-06
3289,Magical!!!,we make the drive down to disneyland from canada for the last weeks of august every year disneyland no matter what your age is one of the most magical places to be the last weeks of august has much smaller crowds since most locals have gone back to school if you are travelling with small children then you want to give yourselves more then day in the park we get day park hoppers and spend from opening till lunch in the park and then go back to our hotel or campground for lunch a swim and a nap then we return to the park around dinner when the crowds lessen the nap helps the kids stay up to see the fireworks or fantasmic both are a must see when visiting disneyland ,5,2017-09-06
3290,Thoroughly enjoyed it,had a fantastic day at dpark had been advised to arrive early so went thru security at the gates by chose dpark on a non early bird entry day there were far less people lining up at dpk it was a monday versus the line up for dcaladvpk gates opened at walked straight to area that was close to indiana jones ride had to wait near roped off area until am park official opening time got on ij ride within mins went up to splash mountain ride straight after min wait here did ride twice in a row as very quiet back to pirates of caribbean highly recommend pre printing map from website to get bearings on where everything is what rides you want to do after pirates went back to ijones only about min wait got back on that ride never had to use a fastpass all day max wait was mins californian schools went back the day we went unbeknown to us at the time it was quite warm mid s which we are used to so that may have kept crowds down when we went to toontown to see mickey mouse sign outside said min wait but no one in the line decided to go in to our surprise basically walked straight around to the door prior to entering seeing him highly recommend to download the disney app to check wait times on rides they do have free guest wifi but very intermittent only disappointing thing was fireworks are only fri sat sun night so missed that mickeys main street parade at is worth seeing as well ,5,2017-08-31
3291,Not for me,i dream of coming to disneyland since i was little i never had a chance until now and it was way too pricey and way too crowded i even got the fast past but it s still at least hour wait for certain attractions i think my dream died a little because it s not as magical for adults lol,2,2017-08-29
3292,Always Fun to visit,as a californian i can visit disneyland more than most people and i enjoy it every time i know the ins and outs of getting a fast pass and using my time to my advantage it is always clean and the people are friendly and the park is well organized it really is a happy place ,5,2017-08-28
3293,Go to Space Mountain first,at the beginning of the day we went straight to space mountain and there was no line for about the first hour but then it got busy quickly ,5,2017-08-25
3294,Almost $200 for a One Day Hopper Ticket and All You Get is Single Ply TP,hahaha title says it all ridiculous prices but do you get what you pay for eh maybe yes maybe no i went alone so i could do what i wanted to do this is the first time i ve actually paid to go because usually i get free tickets by winning them or knowing people who work there who need to use their extra tickets and go with family prices are ridiculous but i knew that before going this is technically a review for both disney parks cons ticket lines are sooooooooooo slow there were only a couple of people ahead of me and it took forever for my turn then i went up told the lady exactly what i wanted had my cash out and it still took her forever a snail could have done it faster walking in the gate with the ticket you just bought is just as slow and painful they take pictures of you now so if you buy a multi day ticket you can t sell it off to someone else fine whatever i get it but it just makes the lines horrendously long and slow just to get in the people behind me complained they should have a line for season passholders i don t have a season pass obviously but he s right why make them wait through the photo sessions no real discounts for socal residents if you want a one day pass you don t really get a discount discounts maybe for two or three days but i don t need two or three days and quite frankly if i used that i d have to drive home and back and one drive up to anaheim every few months in the crummy ca traffic is more than enough if i stayed in anaheim then i d have to pay extra for a hotel so there really wouldn t be savings soooooooooo many people they should cut off the number somewhere but obviously they won t because of oh and this wasn t considered a peak day i d hate to see how many people are there on those days single ply toilet paper that seriously wasn t a joke why do you pay so much for tickets and then use the restrooms to find out they only buy single ply toilet paper cheapskates yeah i can t believe i even had that thought but i did disney is great at line deception you see the time then look at the line and think oh that s not so bad then you get in line and it just goes back and forth and back and forth and around and down and up and in places you didn t even know existed getting into the line yikes it s amazing how well they can hide a line of a gazillion people dirty dirty dirty usually disney is pretty clean but this time it was just gross food all over the ground almost squished my feet in several discarded food items including popcorn ice cream sandwiches and who knows what else and there were random things lying around in ride lines cough cough tampon cough cough ew people start lining up for the parade like two hours early and then there are just people in the way everywhere oh and for those of use pathetic souls there by ourselves who might want to go on rides that normally have lines out the wazoo with parents and little kids in fantasyland parade time might be a good time to do that except oh yeah they shut everything down in fantasyland at that time now i m not sure of the real reasoning behind this because at this point i left and went to downtown disney until after the parade and fireworks crowd cleared out but yeah that sucks i can t for the life of me figure out why the ride for the peter pan ride is so massively long even when i ve gone to night parties with radio stations fourth or fifth time here and finally got on it with a short time of mins and this was at pm people are rude as can be cutting in line trying to ram you with their stroller if you aren t moving fast enough trust me i move as fast as possible but can t do that if there are a million people in the way just randomly stop in the middle of walkways to check their phone or map disney used to have lines down to a science what happened fast pass lines longer than the regular line people seemed to be having trouble having their phones scan using that option for their fast passes so that slowed things down employees urging people to get fast passes for that current time so the people already in line have to wait longer why single rider line over on screamin is a joke universal does this very well disney does not maybe it s done poorly on purpose there are issues with the lines in the restaurants the main one i went to was rockett s whatever over in tomorrowland choices of salad pasta or pizza the employee flat out said salad and pasta were one line pizza was separate then he disappeared so while the rest of us waited for pasta in a non moving salad line people were cutting ahead of us and getting grumpy behind us food didn t appear to be coming out and the line was at a stand still parking due to the number of people you park all the way out in the timbuktu lot and then you get the fun of waiting in a long line for the shuttles before you even get to the parks star wars pros long hours the day i went the hours at dl were am to am till pm at ca i had hoped to get there earlier but to avoid the worst of the traffic on the expressways i didn t leave until about am and got there by about am this actually worked out better for me i ended up staying there later that evening and i got in a good number of rides after the fireworks crowd left if i had gotten there earlier i probably would have left the parks earlier and not come back due to the close proximity of the parks i was able to go to dl do a bunch of stuff head over to ca and do many things i wanted to do then head back to dl and get in some more fun i was also able to escape for a bit and grab dinner at downtown disney then head back yet again was happy with what i managed to fit into my day i fit in my favorites did a bunch of extras saw some of those street shows got to both parks and this was with a million people there if you re able to use the fast passes properly i only used one all day by the way and didn t pay extra for whatever the cell phone thing is since i don t have a cell phone and pay attention to the slow areas you ll get in quite a bit if you go on an off day you can probably squeeze a lot more into a one day ticket employees all were nice and super helpful no matter how stupid my question hey it s disney free water managed to get through the day buying only one drink with my meals and even the ice cream i had i just got a nice cup of ice water at the right places they ll give you nice big cups too rather than those dinky little things to stay cool and hydrated and trust me on a mid summer day in socal you ll appreciate it first aid area was a lifesaver i had a massive headache i had been battling all day and despite drinking tons of water and doing everything i knew how to get rid of it without taking anything i finally decided to get something so i could fully enjoy the rest of the day i thought it might take awhile but i simply asked if they had anything wrote down my name and they handed me a two pack of some sort of headache relieving awesomeness easy peasy overall it was a decent day but i think i ll stick with my original belief that it s only best to go to places like this in the off season it was good for the day it was but could have been a lot less stressful and lot more enjoyable when it s not as packed ,3,2017-08-25
3295,Great Day,spent on day in disneyland make sure you get the disneyland app the gives you the wait time for line worked great most rides we waited less then minutes and we went in july at the end of the night we went back to space mountain and waited over an hour bad timing everyone ran there after the fireworks was over ,5,2017-08-22
3296,Broken rides let us down.,went yesterday and spent dollars on this day out only to be booted out of two queues as the snow white ride and the winnie the pooh ride broke down wasting over an hour and half of our time queuing for these two when we could ve got on something else doubt the park management will offer us free tickets to go back we had two very disappointed little people ,3,2017-08-22
3297,Not Orlando,the park is fun for little kids but this is not magic kingdom in orlando thunder mountain ride broke twice on the one day we were there while i was online so everyone was turned back luckily i didn t get stuck on the ride like the few i saw any case if you are in la with little kids it s ok to visit i got discounted tickets but still think too expensive this park should cost half of orlando in my opinion ,3,2017-08-21
3298,Day out,this is the happiest place on earth but it could do with a being dragged into the modern day by that i mean all the ride should remain as they are because they are still fun and have the excitement for any age you are but the park itself is very dated we visited on a hot day and there isn t a lot of shade to hide from the sun and apart from buying a expensive drink there isn t anywhere to really cool down so please remember to drink a lot and think of the weather before you head there the park itself is great fun but the rides can build of up waiting times very quick so either be prepared or make use of the fast pass service also keep a eye on the characters because some of them will only be around for a limited time so don t miss people also last thing for the parade at the end and fire work show people will camp out places early and i mean early so find somewhere comfy with a good view and stay put ,3,2017-08-18
3299,Disneyland is good but not great,having being brought up with disney i was little disappointed when we got there maybe because it was raining but that meant there were small lines on reflection i think it was because it hasn t change much from when it first opened also i feel my kids thought they were too old for many of the rides attractions saying that the log ride and pirates of the caribbean were great also as it was raining the ponchos on offer were expensive and didn t last the day ,3,2017-08-15
3300,Well organised,we spent one day at the park we found the rides suitable for a wide age range which was great immaculately clean and well organised fast pass great if you organise it but expect to still be in queues it is disney in the middle of summer we had a break in the afternoon from the heat and went back in the evening good fun day for us all ,4,2017-08-14
3301,Disneyland where a kid could be a kid,well my family and i went at the end of december and it was packed full of people we had to wait an hour or more to ride any of the rides disneyland was too crowded at this time of year couldn t enjoy it if your planning on taking a trip go on off peak seasons or your child will be fussy and crying like mine were we probably only rode rides out of the whole day ,4,2017-08-14
3302,Doesn't get much better,although the park gets very crowded around this time of year it is something you learn to get past you re in the happiest place on earth the long lines are great quality time for family and friends the park is always clean from the sidewalks to the bathrooms the food options are great disneyland is a true american icon if you have never been before learn how fastpass works it will make your day much easier and help with long waits space mountain is a very fun ride we also love splash mountain for cooling off pirates of the carribean is so fun and typically not a long wait we also really like indiana jones the ride the park is great for people of all ages they do a good job of providing and catering to every age group there are many great rides for younger kids and the park is very stroller friendly ,5,2017-08-12
3303,Busy and Dissapointing,had two days here on a day ticket and should have booked the other way around as the disney california adventure park experience was way better very busy food was over priced and the staff were disinterested to be honest ,3,2017-08-12
3304,Disneyland with three young kids,we have three children and and had the the most amazing trip to the california disneyland parks we loved it the disneyland cast are amazing and helpful the park itself is gorgeous and so fun we purchased a three day ticket so we did two days in disneyland and one day at california adventure park we hired two prams strollers which you can do once you enter the disney zone prior to entering either park or downtown disney it was us and well worth it all three kids managed to pile into the prams so no one ever got tired and managed to last until at least pm we took lots of breaks in the many shaded areas with lots of snacks available to buy the food inside the park is great the healthy options for kids is brilliant with fruit and milk juice available with most meals my girls are and and a perfect age for this trip where they met all the princesses and had a princess makeover my son is and we thought maybe a bit young but not at all he had a blast and was actually able to go on a great many rides when the girls were having their princess makeover we arranged for him to get knighted and be given a sword and shield he loved it they also had a jedi training school which was so fun for the kids you have to put your name down in tomorrowland and i recommend you do that when you first arrive also take advantage of the fastpass system where available this is available on some of the more popular rides that can have minute wait times you basically scan your park ticket at the special fastpass box near the ride and it will give you a time for example pm pm when you can return and basically walk straight onto the ride with maybe a min wait brilliant idea all in all a great trip ,5,2017-08-09
3305,Disney - Cali style,after doing orlando numerous times we decided we wanted to see where it all started so stayed in anaheim to visit the original park it was just as we expected smaller scale smaller castle but with many of the main attractions and favourite rides the adventure park was more of a seaside fairground theme but still had a few of the popular disney rides including soarin and toy story midway mania great disney vibe but not on the scale of the orlando experience ,4,2017-08-09
3306,The happiest place on Earth,nearly years have past since i had been to disneyland loved every second of our families visit being the th of july we were expecting long queues the park was busy but if you followed the fast pass system the waits were short great place for all ages ,5,2017-08-08
3307,Mr Toads Wild Ride,we stayed at disney grand california hotel and got into the park an hour early each day before the local pass holder crowds we actually rode the fantasyland rides two or more times before the park opened my fidgeting kids didn t have to wait minute or more to ride mr toads wild ride star tours and space mountain no problem minutes top worth every penny worth the stay we went back to the hotel for a late lunch and a pm swim too fyi that s a real life tinker bell flying in the night sky disney is magic ,5,2017-08-08
3308,Better than Magic Kingdom WDW,we are a big fan of everything disney if i had to compare wdw in florida to disneyland ride to ride anaheim is the winner pirates haunted mansion big thunder space mountain buzz astro and small world are all better plus anaheim has storybook land boats matterhorn and indiana jones in terms of food anaheim has a better selection of varied food choices monte cristo sandwiches at blue bayou need i say more if i did not have to fly hours to visit california as opposed to hours to visit florida i would be an annual guest at this classic park ,5,2017-08-06
3309,It is really magic,this was my first visit to any of the disney parks and must admit i was skeptical at first but it was a really magical experience everything is extremely well organized from transport from and to the parking lots the restaurants and of course the rides we used the recently introduced fast pass which allows for fast entry to attractions this works very good as we never waited more than minutes for a ride getting the maximum experience out of our day i was also surprised by the compactness of the park meaning you don t have to walk for miles to get from one attraction to the next lastly making diner reservations at your restaurant of choice also helps to get the most out of your day and the price quality of the restaurants are more than ok only price for bottles water in the park at for a small bottle is outrageous ,5,2017-08-05
3310,Can't wait to go back!,disneyland has been a life long tradition for our family we always love going people complain about the high ticket prices but monthly payments make it easier to keep enjoying our favorite theme park it s clean safe fun for all ages ,5,2017-08-02
3311,Never disappoints,came to the happiest place on earth and what can i say it was awesome kids had a blast parades were super fireworks were outstanding wish some of the other families and people that are there were a bit more considerate but that s not disney s fault ,5,2017-08-01
3312,Honeymoon adventure,disney was good but they don t do enough to make it a very special and easy experience they need to look at their fast pass system again you shouldn t have to constantly keep taking tickets out of your bag all day universal gave u a tiket round your neck instead and their fast pass really worked we completed universal in a morning disney we were there all day and only managed about six rides we queued for the majority of the day the place was absolutely packed we could hardly move lining up all day to do about rides just is not worth it never again will i return to disney california management need to go to universal studios to learn how to improve the experience eg in disney you had to buy drinks all day costing you a fortune in universal you buy one cup for dollars and get free refills all day ,3,2017-08-01
3313,Thank you Disney,we visited disneyland park on a surprise trip for our kids and continue to fall in love with the disney experience thank you for making the magic disney ,5,2017-08-01
3314,I Love Disneyland!,i m always happy when i m in disneyland this time was no exception it s fun seeing the park through my children s eyes as they discover the magic of set design imagination and engineering all combined lines weren t too long this year we got great use out of fast passes and we also felt like our kids were old enough to try the single rider experience to shorten a wait a time or two plus we made sure to enjoy old favorites like the tiki room that require very little waiting we re already daydreaming about our next opportunity to go to disneyland it may be far off but we ll try to go again i m sure ,5,2017-07-31
3315,The Original is Very Cool...,for the record i am a wdw junkie been times or more and it s an amazing place i just went i disneyland for the first time two weeks ago after being to both i m still a fan of wdw more than disneyland but there were some things i liked as good or more at disneyland it s a small world has an amazing front the ride was like new as well splash mountain was one person so a seat and we really got wet very cool several rides were down for multiple hours and that s always a bummer but in the end we still got to see pirates the haunted mansion and buzz lightyear i like seeing how the same and how different i did like the intimate feel for fantasmic a bit more about why someone likes one place better than the other the reason why one person likes the other more is not as much about the given park as the situation if you went to one and loved it especially many times it s your park i know wdw like my own house at disneyland i needed a map if your family went there for vacations it s family memories we ve been to wdw a lot when the kids were young if you are a walt disney junkie you might like the land better as it was the first one and it was very cool being at the one he was at and if you went to the land you might like the smaller space better as its can be more intimate but if you went to wdw you might like the space much better and there are more outside the park activities but still within the property so it s more about the memories than anything both parks have a lot of similar rides but they are also very different in the end it s about comparing apples and oranges both are fruit and each is good just not the same ,5,2017-07-31
3316,Timeless Experience!,i would like to say right from the beginning i am a huge disney fan so this review may seem biased however this review will be as honest as possible from a traditional consumer i visited this park with my girlfriend on a wednesday we experienced a large crowd as expected however the saving grace of our trip was purchasing the newly added maxpass which is part of the disneyland app this costs an additional per park ticket what this allows you to do is get fast passes from your phone directly without going to the ride to receive them we were able to get one as soon as we walked in and then depending on how long from when our fastpass was available we could get them as soon as mins to an hour and half of all the rides we did which was all and some doubles we only waited in regular lines once for fastpass rides twice which was early in the day we had a magical experience but budget accordingly for food as that was quite the surprise to us who don t get to visit often in additional all the photos your take can get added to your phone thanks to the maxpass option as well and gets uploaded directly to the disneyland app ,5,2017-07-29
3317,Can't ever say anything bad about Disneyland,disneyland was great and we went with our young kids the writer switch option is great on big rides so you don t have to stand in line with your kids the whole time we went on a saturday in the summertime in the lines weren t even that bad which was great no complaints whatsoever ,5,2017-07-26
3318,Crowds,just to crowded to have a relaxing trip it seems like you have to hustle everywhere just to get to the next ride or attraction the light show and parade send the park into overload ,3,2017-07-24
3319,My family's favorite place,i ve been to disneyland over times in my life i am it s a once a year at minimum destination for us and we always have a great time we are so excited for galaxy s edge can t wait to come back and see it and to ride the updated railroad my favorite ride is big thunder mountain and the renovation is terrific disneyland offers the best fireworks displays you will ever see and the parades are always fun as well another thing we love about disneyland is the constant high quality of food and new menu items all the time ,5,2017-07-22
3320,A great day - if well planned,love love disneyland but do your homework there are tons of blogs and websites to learn how best to navigate the park for example be there slightly before they open and head straight to the first two rides on your list that will have long lines think space mountain and indiana jones save the rides where lines move fast like pirates and haunted mansion for later bring a bag with water or snacks for little ones prices in the park are a little crazy you can find a list of all of the places in the park that have hidden mickeys it makes for a fun search and find game if you head to customer relations first thing and ask for a reservation at blue bayou you might get a seat at the only public wait served restaurant ,5,2017-07-19
3321,Heaven and Hell,heaven the original disney rides like teacups and small world whimsical and sweet imagination true artistry from the mind of walt disney hokey to some people but enchanting for younger children and adults too so neat to see kids eyes light up with the sheer silliness of it all the character actors princesses and heroes these disney employees really play the part and take pics with lines of children and still manage to make happy experiences for kids and families prepare your child to wait patiently bring an autograph book and pen you don t have to buy there bring from home the night parade big floats with thousands of lights music and characters disney takes the basic parade idea and multiplies it by a hundred however this is the most uncomfortably crowded time that we experienced there fireworks every night around tip the fireworks are pretty substantial you can see them from blocks away if you don t want to be packed like sardines you can stand or sit outside the park in the big plaza just outside the admission gates near downtown disney and see them perfectly fine the greenery and landscaping yes a detail but lovely nonetheless the topiaries in fantasyland trees shaped like an elephant a horse elephant so charming the greenery in bugs world long lush greenery representing the point of view of a bug the jungle greenery along the jungle cruise a lot of areas in disneyland are very open and sun baked but there are a few green lush beautifully maintained greenscapes that are pretty california adventure park the partner park to disneyland loved the art deco theme on the main street the frozen show at the theatre was great and air conditioned this park was about less crowded than disneyland and had tons of great rides plus all the disney characters make appearances there as well hell a lot of walking plus more walking the july mid day heat is not the best time for families with children to walk for hours plan your excursion duck into the little movie theatres restaurants and shops for regular doses of air conditioning also plan rest breaks in shady areas with kids take a minute break every minutes or so sit drink some water and re charge crowds sometimes dangerous levels evening around pm was intensely crowded they dim the lights in the park to prepare for the parade not a safe feeling moving through a crowd with a stroller in the dark staff help direct with lighted batons but still an uncomfortable experience ride line ups what to add on this topic they re a drag fastpasses are good and bad you have to come back at a designated time often hours later you then have to plan your schedule around this one ride you cannot get fast passes for multiple rides just one ride at a time we found that for some rides it was easier to not bother with the fastpass at all sometimes just walking back to a ride area minutes later will surprise you with a shorter line ear piercing noise on some rides shattering people s eardrums does not add to the thrill of the experience this is not really an issue with the little kids rides but some of the older kids rides have noise levels that are ridiculously high ,3,2017-07-18
3322,Family,first trip to the land family fun on the hottest days not a fan of the fast pass method using your park ticket to get fast pass and then again twice in the fast pass entrance line such a pain taking it in and out with possibility of damage loss disneyland uses cardstock tickets not plastic or bands for their hoppers we had the true disney experience without the crowds and lines of disney world def recommend going on a monday wednesday we had great luck getting on all the rides before dinner i used the unofficial guide book with day plans in the back of book leaving us time to explore our hotel pool and ca adventure park in the evening we stayed off park but the anaheim off site hotels are closer than almost all onsite hotels in disney world i would return ,5,2017-07-17
3323,Crowded by Fun,we knew it would be crowded but was the only time with grandkids out of school couldn t believe the number of strollers and adult scooters several things were closed when we were there for the first week in june don t know if this was just our luck or the norm all the smaller grandkids eventually rode space mountain the oldest one times get there early and don t overlook fast pass it s definitely worth using note once you get a fast pass for one ride you can t get another one on that same ticket until about minutes before the first one comes due most food actually in the park is very expensive and so so in quality opt for minimum lunch and eat dinner outside park food in downtown disney is still expensive but generally much better quality ,4,2017-07-15
3324,Disneyland is for Adults as well as Children,when you wish upon a star there s no difference who you are age only makes disney land more wonderous order of must see attractions rides pirates of the caribbean jungle cruise peter pan it s a small world story book canal boats the haunted mansion mr toad s wild ride the matterhorn bobsled the grand parade the nightly fireworks and the last and most rewarding a personal photo with mickey mouse a must and don t forget minney as well all these rides are marvellous and elderly person friendly ,5,2017-07-13
3325,Love it,every time i come here i have an awesome time but it saddens me when i leave but i always know that i will come back even when i die i will live at the park as a ghost in the haunted mansion lol,5,2017-07-12
3326,Disney has lost its magic.,same as my review on ca adventure park too hot with little shade for long lines i advise to go thru singles line if they offer it or buy vip tickets that put you to head of line also excellent idea for universal studios ,4,2017-07-12
3327,Must do/must go to,ok so lets start with an admission i was probably not that keen to go to disneyland it was more an appeasing activity than a must do activity so now the confession i really enjoyed it it was far better than i could every have imagined the best bits well i am a bit traditional so i really loved fantasyland and frontierland new orleans square is a great place to watch the fireworks there is a visual representation plus you can see the fireworks seriously very impressive the parade at pm was another highlight our first day was th july omg the red white blue patriotism was everywhere vacation season is probably not the most optimal time to go but it was an amazing experience would i go again at a blink was it fun yes one of the more enjoyable things to do is to watch the some of the original animations the ones that started it all ,5,2017-07-12
3328,Great fun if you are thoroughly prepared,the happiest place on earth well that depends on your approach my adult daughter and i loved it we had a multiday pass with magic morning allowing us admission an hour before general park opening on one morning the key here was to maximise that hour by heading to the most popular ride which didn t have a fast pass option immediately peter pan fast pass is the way to go for those rides that allow them not as many in this park as in california adventure land and the even rarer single rider option when the park officially opened an hour later we headed to the pirates of the caribbean and walked straight in with a boat to ourselves we then checked out the other rides in frontierland while everyone else was still queuing in fantasyland by about am the park is crowded during the summer so unless you are really utilising the fast pass you need to be prepared to wait getting an early spot for the various parades and fireworks shows is also a good idea there are more food options in disneyland some of which are actually okay and the place is clean and cast members patient and friendly the only other downside is the number of baby strollers sure it s a family place but i wouldn t have dreamed of bringing under s here as it s crowded noisy and they really won t remember it anyway ,5,2017-07-11
3329,"Good experience, but expensive to eat/drink there",you are allowed to bring in your own food drinks worth it to do so and rent a locker definitely take advantage of the free fastpass ,4,2017-07-11
3330,Disappointing customer service,we had cast members rude to us over simple questions more than time per day rides were inefficiently managed with or more seats in a row going unfilled on rides despite lines for rides cast members spending time hanging out with each other instead of paying attention to customers and their job very few employees had that disney upbeat spirit we ve grown to love at disney world very disappointing experience i like grumpy but not in staff members just seemed like it was hard to find a cast member that wanted to be there disney world in florida is the exact opposite in customer service it s the happiest place on earth at disney world and a very average place at disneyland ,2,2017-07-10
3331,Race weekend,we went for the disneyland half and enjoyed it immensely the parks are so much more manageable comparing to the disney world and there is still so much to do or see the night shows are worth every second make sure to get your fast passes early for cars and toy story ,5,2017-07-10
3332,Disneyland Family Vacation,disneyland is still magical our family visited both parks with park hopper passes in days we were able to do all the attractions that we wanted the fast passes always help for the most popular rides downtown disney is connected with several restaurants ,5,2017-07-09
3333,"Really, really overpriced, even when it's not crazy busy",had we gone when everyone was out of school would have likely been disappointed overall the ride waits weren t horrible if you knew how to use fastpasses they were changing the system while we were there so make sure you read up on what s new if you haven t been in a while the cost is inordinate from the entrance to the food to the junk aka souvenirs glad my son understands prices and budgets the one quote on this topic that will stick with me was from some poor dad i just paid for small bottles of water and for churos buy water at walmart bring your refillable and if churos are something that need to be tried costco sells em for a buck ,3,2017-07-08
3334,Maintenance and service have gone downhill, the happiest place on earth there is still a lot of magic in the park but if you have been a visitor over the years you will see how the park has declined paint is not touched up as it once was trash is strewn about the streets and the once legendary service is now easily outclassed by the service at universal character costumes show signs of wear cast members cannot answer basic questions and broken animatronics can be seen in the tiki room and it s a small world the food is still on point and is a must but overall if you want an amazing disney experience i suggest heading to florida ,3,2017-07-05
3335,Does Disneyland even need a review?,the happiest place on earth stars just go it was the best day it s so much fun make good use of the fast pass option for certain rides we did it and it meant we literally never waited more than mins for a ride also make sure you bring a backpack of snacks and drinks if you re not prepared to pay the high prices inside the park but just for a gauge we were there for hours and all i ended up buying to eat was kabobs from bengal bbq and a side of fries and funnel cake from critter country which altogether was around usd we read on the website that backpacks weren t allowed so we left our bag of snacks at the hostel but everyone had backpacks even cooler bags buy the trade off is that you have to carry stuff around all day which was a good thing for us as we only had small cross body bags that were easy to take on rides there is water stations everywhere so it s easy to fill up bottles if you bring ones with you if it s your first time or it s your birthday or you re celebrating something special head to the information desks at the start of the park they re on the left side when you walk in after you ve scanned your ticket they will give you free badges to wear for the day i got a birthday one and most of the staff and some patrons shouted me a happy birthday throughout the day we went on pretty much all of the rides the matterhorn bobsled and indiana jones were awesome pirates of the caribbean had a really cool story and was quite realistic splash mountain was awesome just go you can t have a bad time at disneyland ,5,2017-07-04
3336,Long Queues,disneyland is fabulous long long queues for the rides though no shelter provided either when you are standing in these queues and the sun is blazing,3,2017-07-03
3337,Crowds and more crowds,its a stretch to give a star review here is more suited you have read all the reviews and already know about disney it bothers me to write anything but a positive review but things have changed here what disney always offered was magic something always pulled at your heart and made you want to come back not anymore disney pulls at your wallet everything is crazy expensive from the gate to the snacks my biggest complaint is the massive amounts of people coming through the doors its like an ant hill of people with them climbing over each other pushing and shoving lines galore and standing and waiting they speed up the rides so you may stand over an hour waiting for a minute ride the little things were not there this time garbage visible workers cutting you off and complaining about their jobs stuff that was unheard of before the outweighs the magic they will take cash and crowds until they start seeing a decline in attendance ,4,2017-06-30
3338,Loved it!,writing a short review of disneyland is like trying to move an entire desert using only a spoon overall it s a magical place that you should see once in your lifetime yes there is the old disneyland versus disneyworld debate the former is the original the latter is bigger but i say why settle on one scoop of ice cream when you can have two try them both each offers unique experiences a few tips to make your experience better first expect lines they are a reality use the fast past system when available to save yourself some grief second take breaks the happiest place on earth is usually where families lose it because they re stressing or arguing third plan ahead make a list of must sees and get to them first fourth arrive early in the day and rush to the back of the park the crowds are like a wave crashing into the attractions so go where they aren t and work backwards fifth have fun be a kid splash in the water eat an ice cream cone and get chocolate on your face smile laugh enjoy oh and when it s time to go just be sure to stop on main street and look at the firehouse the second floor was walt s apartment and the lamp glowing dimly in the window was lit whenever he was in the park it has been burning ever since his death in to symbolize that he will always be there in disneyland so give ol walt a nod and a wink on your way out ,5,2017-06-25
3339,Always get to the park early,you always have to time your visit to get the most value get to the park right when it opens and you will get to all your favorite rides but you can also pay for lots of extras that can get you better views of fireworks parades and soon the return of fantasmic be sure to use the fast pass system and ask for advice from cast members and friendly guests that are annual pass holders ap s for short cause we are the people who really know the park well ,5,2017-06-24
3340,"Looong queues, some rides out of service!",visited disneyland after several years not much was new and several rides were out of service huge disappointment ,3,2017-06-24
3341,Night time at the park,take your children to the park after pm we were able to ride all the rides in a short amount of time ,5,2017-06-21
3342,LOVE IT,just pricey but truly a blessing to be here at my age it is still magic have fun and make memories ,5,2017-06-20
3343,Awesome Time!,we come to disneyland once a year in october and this was a surprise for our daughter s th birthday there were women only on our trip no kids we had a blast used fast pass when we wanted to ride something with big lines worked out great take a break and see some shows my only bad experience was when i went to city hall as i do every year to obtain my handicap sticker the young lady said that i didn t need one due to my brace well when my leg got too swollen to wear the brace i was unable to get in the handicap line yes i always carried my dmv paperwork this was our only problem lines were short too ,5,2017-06-20
3344,2nd visit,let me start by stating i have been to wdw in florida about times this is my nd trip to disneyland in cali there really is no comparison but a really fun time can still be had here i just get a little off when i see the cast members outside their working area in uniform thanks to the utilidors that doesn t happen in florida it is still disney with that disney magic the sights and sounds can be found nowhere else but disney service is excellent prices are also disney which means a quick lunch is going to cost about soft drinks will cost about live a little and splurge it s disney you can have as much fun as you can pack into a day if you plan around the crowds ,4,2017-06-14
3345,Fun for everyone,tip there are fast pass machines they re free at some of the rides they actually work you can get one pass and then when the first avaliable time you can ride the ride on your pass say you can ride the ride at pm comes you are able to get another pass for another ride i m not sure all the rides have this option but when avaliable totally take advantage tip don t listen to year olds i waited in like hours for the matterhorn it was not worth the wait that was my biggest disney mistake tip don t eat at the food court in tomorrowland the burger was dry and terrible nothing redeeming about it should have waited and gone somewhere else also the churro s don t have dipping sauce like chocolate or anything tip just have fun it was a tuesday when i went and it was super crowded lot of people traffic jams and long lines for everything i was a little surprised though going to these places as a child you don t notice the looks on the faces of the cast members operating the rides and directing people it s either utter disgust with people or absolute boredom ,4,2017-06-14
3346,Magical as always!!,my son and i took this trip alone he is a teenager and still loves everything disney the parks are always amazing and we have an awesome time there i would suggest that you take snacks and water for sure they have water fill stations so you can take a refillable water bottle i would also highly suggest that you take at least one break during the day to rest and eat a meal outside of the park unless you are okay with spending big bucks on a meal the food you will find at disneyland is not that great compared to the surrounding restaurants outside of the park lastly take advantage of fastpasses and magic morning because the park gets so crowded that you will spend most of your day just waiting in line and will probably miss some of the best rides if you don t ,5,2017-06-11
3347,Magical experience for all ages,both me and my husband went to disney on may we booked the tickets online through a discount scheme got there around am it wasn t very crowded at that time from entrance to park has a long distance which is connected by continuous trams you can walk if you like but i think it s better to save your energy for park activities we were contemplating whether to get fast pass but then we didn t so this is the important tip your regular ticket entitles you for a fast pass for park s busiest attractions not all attractions have fast pass option so if the attraction is available with fast pass go to the person issuing them and get your fast pass for that particular ride the printed fast pass will tell you when to return back to the ride to utilize it so you can plan your time and use that time for some other activity the day we went to the park it was open till mid night and it started getting crowded after am we started from tomorrowland and it took us so long to finish it since it had many busy rides but some other sections didn t have so many rides big thunder mountain railroad pirates of the caribbean haunted mansion splash mountain star wars were notable rides and many rides in fantasyland are meant for kids but you can do them if you like just to bring back childhood memories unfortunately we couldn t do indiana jones finding nemo submarine ride had a very long queue but it was just average for me it s a small world and a jungle boat cruise are also ok however there s one negative about splash mountain i think the log we sit isn t safe that way it doesn t have belts and you just need to hang on to the seat in front of you the ride has almost degree ft fall and if you are not properly seated what if you just throw yourself off the log we did it but i seriously think park administration should introduce seat belts for safety everywhere in the park you ll find plenty of restaurants to eat the theme of restaurant will be aligned to the park section it s located i found great vegetarian food and it was great you can find out in the brochure when the parade is taking place we saw it twice but the electric parade in the dark was magical even the castle is lit up unfortunately they cancelled fire works due to wind once you re done for the day the tram will bring you back to the entrance area disney land park has another adjoining disney california adventure park but you need a separate day for that so we didn t have time overall this is a must visit for kids or adults coming to la ,5,2017-06-10
3348,you already know its great,surprised at how many rides we did on a saturday we got there a lil after which is when gates opened went directly to tomorrow land and by o clock we were able to do the star wars ride space mountain fast pass buzz lightyear x the car ride and the nemo submarine ride after it got more busy but it would work out pretty good to get a fast pass then go stand in line for minutes on a different ride and ride it use the fast pass and repeat the sequence we did over rides during the hours we were there it was great ,5,2017-06-08
3349,Disneyland = crowds!,really pick your visiting time the crowds can be ludicrous our first day in this dream come true happened to coincide with the locals last weekend to use their annual passes nightmare we left early and returned the next day when crowds weren t as bad but still far more than should be in one park at a time attention to detail is mesmerising waltz dream is amazing the walt tribute hosted by steve martin brought a tear princesses were just beautiful and so engaging other staff were obviously overworked disneyland is not the happiest place on earth it s the most crowded which is a real shame despite the long hours the park is open despite this we truly loved every minute at universal the st visit badges mean something unfortunately at disneyland they re not even acknowledged let alone mean anything ,5,2017-06-08
3350,disappointing,we were visiting from out of state several rides were closed it would have been nice to know this ahead of time very crowded it also would have been nice to have the website mention grad nite had the mentioned it along with the closed rides we would have scheduled our visit at a different time there were several issues with fast passes as well ,3,2017-06-08
3351,Poor value.,we found this place to be a real disappointment it is disney s oldest park and is clearly showing its age not that many rides with big queues for them all lots of shops selling overpriced disney merchandise it seems a shame that they want to fleece you in the shops when the entry fee is so expensive having said that it is very popular with lots of locals with many people clearly enjoying repeat visits and happy to pay for disney clothes mouse ears etc etc it just wasn t our cup of tea we are british and probably don t have the same emotional attachment to disney that some americans do ,2,2017-06-02
3352,A dream 😍,ive gone to this park a couple of times the last i went with my brother and we both were in love with this place the food the staff with every single person in this place that made is have such an amazing vacations ive been there three times and im still haven t had enough activities for everybody from children to adults ,5,2017-06-02
3353,What a ride!,i went to disneyland as a child but did not remember a lot especially since so much has changed i now live in florida and go to disney world quite often so between these two facts i found it interesting going again the first thing is that because of location it is so much more crowded to enter in the morning but that isn t the parks fault the second thing you notice is that everything is so much more closer together and the castle is so much more tiny compared to the magic kingdom in orlando the third thing is something i noticed as a fault of the company it seems that equipment and rides aren t kept up as well or updated to latest tech like it is in orland its like the company has let the original park suffer for the sake of the larger park on the cool and interesting side it was very interesting to go through the same rides and notice what was different between the two parks i actually found that i preferred some of the disneyland versions over the orlando ones also on the positive side the fun and service is just as attention to detail in all the parks ,5,2017-05-31
3354,Disappointing visit on New Year's Eve,we visited here on new year s eve because we were in town for a short visit for the rose bowl we were greated by extremely unorganized security lines and very big crowds almost like they were ready for it which is surprising for disney some lines checked bags some had metal detectors some did nothing but there was no organization around it the park itself had long lines at most attractions even though it was raining but most moved pretty quickly and the time estimates were helpful the fireworks which we watched from our hotel room at the hilton were excellent but we re glad we didn t stay with the crowds to watch them i can t believe the prices they charge for entrance fees and food ,3,2017-05-28
3355,Way too busy!!!!,we went on friday may and it was absolute crap crowds were over the top we had to compete with grads and the locals that had only till the may to use their discounted entry paid a huge amount of money to stand in lines and with a who is autistic and yr old this is not magical we travelled all the way from australia to fight crowds worst experience of our lives i felt terrible complaining to them but i had to when you spend the previous mths hyping your kids and husband up to go and spending the amount of a small car to go here you expect more we come from a small city in qld and it felt like our whole population was there we found out later that it was we tried again on tuesday may and weds may and these days were still as crowded even locals were saying it was like terror land our year old said it is definitely not magical will not be going back anytime soon ,2,2017-05-28
3356,Bad mood Mickey Mouse,on my family visited disneyland unfortunately we had some issues early in the morning we went to see mickey mouse house and met him as fantasia wizard when my wife tried to hold him to take a picture mickey move out the hand later in the star tour i was carrying my yr old kid and a crew woman said something i didn t hear and she started screaming to me and when i told her to calm she just turn and walked in addition we didn t see many characters donald and daisy never appear finally the light parade possibly was the simplest and poorest i ve had seen maybe because it was monday,4,2017-05-25
3357,Second dissapointing experience at Disneyland,the price is too high for really a lot of waiting around on our recent visit my sister and i had to wait for hours because of power outages i m not talking about rides that were planned to be closed i m complaining about the fact that pirates big thunder the matterhorn and haunted mansion were all not working pretty much all at the same time this was tuesday may rd basically there were major problems from around noon pm this along with planned ride closures no indiana jones no tram creates a situation in which i ve payed a lot of money to be walking around a park with a ton of people with nothing to really do restaurants get super full and people are asked to be super patient it feels like i should be getting paid instead of the other way around ,3,2017-05-24
3358,Long lineups,we were surprised at the amount of closures and crazy lineups monday to thursday was not too crazy but the weekend is nuts average hours per ride pirates of the caribbean was over hours closures on and off throughout the day was splash mountain and hyperspace mountain make sure to get day passes if you want to get on all the rides ,3,2017-05-22
3359,Revisiting after many years,took advantage of the day pass special offered ending in may haven t been there since my grown children were young the amazing disney imagination is still there although many changes have occurred i spent day at disneyland and days at disney california park miss the sky tram people mover over time changes are inevitable with new ideas appreciate all that the park offers plus the many wonderful memories i have when i came as a kid downtown disney and the california park replace the massive parking lot liked the parking lot tram to get us to downtown which is the entry way to the parks i m so glad walt created this it s a work of love it will continue to grow as long as their is imagination left in the world the whole thing started with a dream a mouse will come back hint use phone app to check on ride wait times use fast track pass or single rider lane for very popular rides ,5,2017-05-22
3360,Magic place!,one of the best places in california you will really enjoy it the shows and attractions are super will back here again ,5,2017-05-17
3361,Truly a magical place,there is so much to see and do and the fast pass option is fantastic the original and my sentimental favorite the parades are a must and my advise is to find a position early and stick with it fireworks are incredible and another must see peter pan ride is one of the most popular rides but doesn t have fast pass so the best option is to go there first thing or during a parade or fireworks with the buzz lightyear ride where you shoot your lazer at certain targets don t forget to email the photo that s taken during the ride you ll find this after you get off the ride but before you enter the shop if you have small children who love star wars then sign up for the jedi training as they will learn to battle the dark side while you can watch and end at tomorrowland terrace i could go on and on but you ll soon discover this for yourself make sure you have more than one day as there is so much to see and do ,5,2017-05-17
3362,Theft report at the Disneyland resort,got our stroller stolen today by grizzly river run headed over to file a report and then with anaheim pd next disneyland security won t do anything about the situation if you need you can file a claim online with anahein pd alsp there are officers just outside downtown disney by the starbucks ,1,2017-05-14
3363,Theme Park!!,what a great experience the people very friendly and some pretty good food available as you would expect it can be a bit pricey but i think overall it was worth it ,5,2017-05-13
3364,From the moment you enter,every second inside the park had something new to see be it a shop tucked into a corner a new restaurant that you hadn t seen the day prior a mid day parade or a marching band the whole time there was something entertaining occuring great time,5,2017-05-13
3365,AMAZING!!,you can t get here to early we arrived at opening and still had to wait in line to have our bags searched and gain entry it wasn t painful but i wouldn t want to do it any later in the day the bus shuttle from the car park to the entrance was very easy and not busy even at pm at night after the parade if you are on a tight budget take food in with you for lunch and snacks you are not going to find a cheap meal here a kids sandwich and water in tomorrowland cost and a small snack size pizza in toon town was eat early or eat late during the day get the app on your phone to check the wait times for rides and use the single rider line always we thought it we would cover everything in a day but didn t even get close we travelled with a one year and he loved pooh corner there are a couple appropriate rides for babies toon town has a playground and we loved being able to have him take a break from the pram and play ,5,2017-05-12
3366,crowds bad service closed rides,dont go worst experience at a fun park apart from one other which is now closed thought i would get the disney experience all i got was lighter pockets ,1,2017-05-11
3367,101 Disney Magic,so if your reading my review your probably from another planet its disney everything is going to be magical and amazing well enough with the sarcastic humor lets get down to business the park is beautiful its clean the rides are fun the service at disney is always pleasant when you interact with the staff you will always have more pros then cons when talking about a disney park lets discuss some problems you may face at the park the lines are horrible yes they preach the fast pass is great but they need to come up with an idea to get the lines either moving faster or to be a lot more pleasant first idea why can t you put benches along the route of lines to sit for a bit while you wait when your standing for over an hour your feet are killing you i have a daughter between her and the pregnant wife you get the point i am sure this is an eternal problem the parks face and i imagine they have a few rocket scientist trying to figure out a solution lets just get back to the basics benches every few feet maybe some cushion floor to help withstand the standing lets talk about food flavor of the food overall where i ate is good problem is all the restaurants are full yes they recommend you reserve weeks in advance on my monday visit the app said the park was at estimated capacity almost every restaurant in frontier land was not accepting walk ins i cannot imagine capacity yes i get the point reservations but it needs to be a lot more free flowing parks should be fun not schedule driven wake up at am have breakfast at am walk to park at am fast pass booth at am for star tours ride eat at pm back to fast pass distribution you get the point its like you need to program your cellphone calendar for all the reminders vacation and theme parks are about feeling free and not living by the real world lets get a little more detailed tomorrow land has become star wars land don t get me wrong i love star wars but what happened to walt disney s vision of innovation to the future keep the stuff you have but look to innovate and bring in things that will amaze us the park is magical in the sense of being the original creation of mr disney himself if your a history buff its a great feeling to walk into history i had a hard time writing this review because i had a great time with the family i leave the park administrators with the pic i posted to this review to remember what disney was working to accomplish its not easy to write a review because experiences are so diverse and can have so many biased opinions i feel i was fair and i hope you all have an amazing time disney parks are amazing and they should keep working to get the maximum experience for all guest i did not post all the pros and or cons do not let this review from keeping you from visiting this park ,3,2017-05-11
3368,Disney is always a great family place.,we were here during the th anniversary celebrating in august our family of six ages to something was short on time at the end of our vacation so we decided to do both parks in one day on a park hopper ticket we had decided that we should be able to do this as the parks are right next to each other walking distance and each a lot smaller than the disney parks in florida we started at california adventure went to disneyland back to ca and ended at disneyland this was a super long day but was totally doable we got to experience most of the things we wanted to do in each park and had a great time doing it although we were dead on our feet at the end of the night some of our adventures at disneyland included haunted mansion it was not near the level of the one in florida but our group seemed to like it for the most part it was fun for our youngest as he is just becoming the age when he tries to act like things don t scare him too much scare factor was right at his level here he was six jungle cruise this was pretty cheesy but the crew member operating the boat did a great job to keep it interesting i wouldn t wait in a long line to do this but it was a fun and quick little attraction hyperspace mountain we wanted to try this one so much that we came back to disneyland after the world of color night show at california adventure we were all dragging and ready for bed but we made our way back slowly to get one of the last rides of the night here everyone loved this dark tunnel ride with a star wars theme i wish more things were visible during the ride but i thought it was fun too pirates of the caribbean this one was a bit cheesy but we love pirate things especially jack sparrow so this was worth it it is a nice family ride with some decent sites and the possibility of a splash or two splash mountain loved this one mainly for the calm ride through a fun theme and then the unexpected splash at the bottom would do this ride each and every time in any disney park especially with new visitors star tours great ride that was loved by all especially our boys if you like star wars you will love the gift shop at the end here fireworks caught these on the way out and from our nearby hotel another night disney always does a great light show in the sky if you are familiar with florida s parks and short on time we think you can totally do both parks in one day if you have the stamina for it we liked california adventure just a little bit more but how can you not love anything disney ,5,2017-05-07
3369,Disney with the cousins,long lines lots of souvenirs to buy and expensive food knowing that we still had a wonderful time meeting up with the cousins during a family reunion starbucks on site helped me rally when the energy to keep up with the wild kids dipped the souvenir disney coffee mugs where adorable i loved hearing the cousins laugh and the girls were precious in their disney princess gowns successful but pricey memory ,4,2017-05-04
3370,everything is closed,now they do have rides at disneyland right i could not find many that worked more than hour than would break down for with all the work being done it is overcrowded because people have few options on what to do i made the mistake of buying a annual pass this month so i will suck it up and go more times in year to pay for it will let you know if it gets any better went on a blackout date for passholders and locals yet it was still packed could not walk abreast,3,2017-05-04
3371,To long of lines - fast passes need adjustments,we were at disneyland for hours and only got to ride rides the lines were to long and the fast passes sucked we got a fast pass for indiana jones but we couldn t ride it for hours after we received the pass we were not able to get another fast pass until the indiana jones was used this made us having to stand in all the long lines for hours very big disappointment when you have a year old and have to stand in line for minutes and sometimes hours just to ride a short little ride i don t think i will be going back to disneyland unless i m rich enough to stay in the disneyland hotel and get to do the early entrance into the park and with the prices of the disneyland hotel it will be years or never before i can afford that it took me a year to save up for this vacation only to be disappointed ,2,2017-04-30
3372,Am I getting too old for Disney Land? - No Way,we had a blast on our trip here with kids now age and lines were long as usual but had a great time last trip i was injured and on crutches so we got to cut the line no such pass this time around not worth getting hurt over but worth considering a trip here if you happen to be hurt no lines is amazing ,4,2017-04-27
3373,My family had a great time,what can you say about disneyland we had a great time our kids had a great time our grandkids ages and had a better than great time the rides are rather repetitious and boring many of the rides are simply the same ride with a different story book theme however little kids enjoy it just the same pros my grandkids loved it the electric parade was actually very good again my grandkids loved it soft pretzels i love soft pretzels the roller coasters are tame enough for the little kids they are not something a roller coaster lover would rave about but they are fun for the kids the disneyland app appeared to work okay it gave wait times for rides that were correct to within an order of magnitude heheh we used fast passes on all rides which cut wait times to very short plan what you will do each day use fast passes and fill in wait times with things that you can do anytime we covered a lot of area in four days saw everything and rode all of the rides that were operating people the disney staff people were excellent i actually felt that they were enjoying helping us and making sure that we and our grandkids had a good time two notables o stephanie pluto my grandkids walked up to a line to see pluto my year old shot up along all the people in line we grabbed her and brought her back stephanie told us that the line had ended and pluto was taking a break she saw the disappointment in my granddaughters face and eyes so she told us to have them stand by a sign and she told pluto he had some walkers pluto slowly strolled with both grandchildren holding their hands and carrying on they were ecstatic the smile on stephanie s face showed tremendous joy in making that happen and thank you to whomever was playing pluto cons cost tickets for four adults and two kids for four days was about food most of the food in the parks is junk if you wanted to commit suicide you could eat the food for several months cost of food outrageous i suggest that if you take kids take food take some fruit and some sandwiches and some drinks here are some approximate prices pretzels veggie wrap hamburger and so on and so on the present the park as being a family place with family values this is good but it really is a joke when you take a look at the disney corporation as a whole and the values they put forth in movies and such security unfortunately people must think about security i am sure that there are a multitude of security safeguards that disney has in place that are unseen however there appeared to be gaping holes in the security that both my son and i noticed over the four days that we were there it appeared that there were numerous ways for bad people to cause mayhem if they so wished i am not going to describe how this could be accomplished or the specifics of what we noticed suffice it to say you are responsible for your own well being discuss with your group what you will do in the event that some moron s decide to make a statement by trying to cause harm to others ,4,2017-04-23
3374,Dated. For younger kids only,we visited disneyland when our kids were and when we got off space mountain ride my year old daughter stated is that it make sure you plan your day around the fast pass system get passes for the most popular rides as early as you can do some research we managed to get on every major ride over the course on day but only through using the fast passes i do not regret going to disneyland it s a bucket list kind of thing i would not go back though unless i was a granddad with a or year old who loved old cartoons some of the infrastructure is very dated and some of the attractions are cringeworthy ,3,2017-04-23
3375,Can you Really Every Outgrow Disney?,we have been to disney world in orlando many times and still found disneyland very enjoyable the last time i had been at disneyland they still used the lettered tickets so let s just say it had been awhile the staff is exceptional we were able to get food quickly and lines were manageable being spring break the park was very crowded even on a tuesday so navigating our way through the park felt very congested we spent one day here and found that to be a good amount of time we probably could have used another half day with that said i also pre plan our disney days by visiting disney s website prior to our trip to make a wish list of the shows and attractions we want to see and do once in the park we grab a map and highlight bring one with you to the park the numbers of the attractions we want to be sure to include in our day this saves a lot of time chasing around the park and wondering if you forgot something as other reviewers suggest you have to maximize the fast pass program the one ride that i wish that they had a fp for and don t is peter pan it s always a long wait after the fireworks we were able to get on it waited minutes if you also like this ride i would recommend going on it first thing after getting your map and for first fp tickets or during the afternoon parade note that a number of rides in fantasyland close temporarily during the electric light parade and open after the last fireworks i also found that the disney app see their website for the specific one was very helpful when looking for characters ride wait times finding bathrooms looking at menus etc and it s free we ll go back some day loved it ,5,2017-04-18
3376,Disney Magic,we haven t visited in about ten years but this month we took a long weekend to visit disneyland even though it was very crowded it was still enjoyable the parades and the world of color were super great disney does this with style and precision the park was sooo clean and everyone so friendly ,5,2017-04-18
3377,Disappointing,overall i was quite disappointed in disneyland i ve been to disney world previously and found that land pales in comparison many rides were closed for refurbishment but they still charge full price the grounds were well maintained and beautiful very limited selection of food options i definitely would not return again ,3,2017-04-18
3378,First time at spring break.,surprisingly not crowded during spring break we always have the best time at disneyland wish we would have done the easter egg hunt but our kids were too busy with rides the grey stuff dessert at red rose tavern in fantasyland was amazing we ate our way through disney churros ice cream monte cristo sandwiches beignets and dole whips looking forward to going back when star wars opens ,5,2017-04-18
3379,Family fun all ages,i have a two year old son they have enough rides to keep him busy for a full day of fun he loved seeing mickey mouse the food was good priced high but expected for disney we ate at blue bayou and they offered a great selection seemed to be the most food for your money and located in a great are to relax away from all the people they do offer a toddler area if you need a quiet place to feed change or tend to a young child we went to the area located in the front of the park the smiles from my two year old was well worth the money to go ,4,2017-04-17
3380,Overcrowded without music,after visiting disneyland paris it became my favorite place in the world so when i was planing to visit disneyland in california i was more than excited we waited in line to get in about minutes and when we got in we couldn t see anything because of the crowd when i saw the castle it was disappointing very small without any music and for sure not magical we managed to go to rides at our hour stay and the minimum waiting time was minutes there was no music no magical atmosphere and everybody was walking around holding a large piece of meat this trip killed the magic and i m sure it also killed disney s dream ,2,2017-04-16
3381,Nice time at Disneyland,went during the week following presidents day weekend both parks were super crowded with some attractions under refurbishment i e pirates matterhorn etc i have been to disneyworld times before but this was our first trip to disneyland went primarily to have a great time and to experience the original park overall liked disneyland but the park was not built to accommodate modern crowds lines for attractions weren t necessarily that long but since all the areas were quite small the park always felt extremely crowded i can appreciate the nostalgia with the park and enjoyed the original rides i e mr toad snow white and pinocchio not currently offered at magic kingdom in florida however the disneyland castle was very unimpressive in size compared to florida s i liked the theme ing of the different lands but all seems really small besides new orleans and didn t take long to walk through we all thought big thunder mountain and soarin were better at disneyland hand s down otherwise you could make an argument which is better for similar rides between land and world with the exception of small world interior seriously in need of basic updating at disneyland the radiator springs racer ride was really good at dca don t miss i asked a few locals when the best off season time to go but everyone said there isn t one other noticeable things compared to disney world we re a lack of children in princess costumes and very short meet and greets my kids are past that age but seemed liked almost every time we saw a character in the park a cast member said they were leaving and would be back later fireworks were also only being done on the weekends during the time we were there disneyland also uses the old fast pass system which i think i would have liked better if the park wouldn t have been under construction the path to frontierland from fantasyland was closed so to get to that side of the park you to basically exit out the castle and start over february weather was colder than normal and should packed a few warmer clothes also disppointed that pirates was under reburbishment but knew that prior to leaving for our trip overall you can t compare a land to a world without bringing up nostalgia and the park the walt actually built anaheim lacks the space and infrastructure while disney world resort is like a small city would i go back to disneyland absolutely however i know where my loyalty stands glad i went and had a good time not at all trying to complain the park just making comparisons from what i ve grown accustomed to at disney world go and enjoy yourself ,4,2017-04-15
3382,Money well spent,we had a day pass for both disneyland and california adventure park we found we had enough time to see both parks in that time taking my kids to disneyland was a dream come true although they are teenagers you couldn t get the smile off their faces from indiana jones to jungle cruise to big thunder mountain railway were all hits we look forward to returning soon ,5,2017-04-13
3383,Too many rides not working and/or closed for maintenance.,traveled across the country to see disneyland but unfortunately it wasn t ready several major attractions were closed for maintenance while several others shut down periodically for whatever reason we didn t get to go on the matterhorn pirates of the caribbean the riverboat captain hook s ship and others i can t think of at the moment the indiana jones ride broke down several times during our visit and we were turned away on those occasions it took us four days to even get to see great moments with mr lincoln as it was often closed for some reason the crowds were unbelievable even though this was supposed to be a quiet off season time at the park they had something called annual passholder days and that may have contributed to the crowds a local guest said it was as bad as any busy summer day overall we didn t enjoy our visit and that s a sad commentary if you look at my avatar you will notice it is a disney castle we are big disney fans and always enjoy disney world we were very disappointed with our five days out at disneyland and the california adventure i hate to say it but we won t be going back there after this experience ,2,2017-04-10
3384,Get up early and pack your comfortable shoes,we visited disneyland and disney adventure park using a day multi park pass only one park per day but personally i think you d be crazy to try to do both in one day we did days at disneyland and one at disney adventure park sunday was much quieter than monday and tuesday over days in the parks we walked over km so make sure you wear comfortable shoes for speed and to avoid the interminable queuing get in to the park as soon as you can and dash for a fast pass to one of the big ticket attractions splash mountain indiana jones star tours or hyperspace mountain for instance simply present to the ride within the allocated time window and you ll skip most of the queue note on your fast pass when you can next get another fast pass this way you can always have two or three on the go at once whilst waiting for the fast pass try some of the other rides which are great too but may not have such crazy queues fantasy land is quietest early in the day even on the busiest day we waited no time for it s a small world pinocchio mr toad etc but gets busier later there is no fast pass system for pirates of the caribbean or peter pan both must do rides the advantage of no fast passes for these rides is that the queue is genuine and ticks along nicely for the parades secure your curb side seat early or enjoy a long stand food and drink is incredibly expensive for one churro we bought tortilla crisps water and sandwiches at the local cvs pharmacy before entering the park and this helped keep costs down a bit a little organisation is required to make the most of your visit spontaneity is definitely over rated enjoy ,4,2017-04-08
3385,Packed packed packed,this was our first time to disneyland it was unfortunately on spring break everything i mean everything was crowded it was very overwhelming we actually had to take a few hour break and go back to our hotel just to get away from the madness tickets are pricey food is pricey souvenirs are pricey lines are super long not enough shaded areas for young kids i don t think we will be back not a good first experience at the happiest place on earth ,3,2017-04-07
3386,Too many rides were down,disneyland is toooo expensive to have so many rides not working very disappointing other than that it was a nice visit ,3,2017-04-07
3387,Not a good experience.,disney used to provide a good experience for families not so much now the price is way too high for what you get admission for a family of four is about plus overpriced parking drinks and food getting to and from parking is at least a minute ordeal each way the park is far too crowded making getting around a pain especially with kids if you want to see a parade or fireworks you have to stake out your spot at least an hour in advance the lines were always an hour long reservations for some rides were hours later the whole day was like shopping at the mall at christmas too may people too much money not much fun disney was the only ones who come out ahead go elsewhere you will have more fun and save a bundle ,2,2017-04-04
3388,Food and wine Fair at California Adventure was terrific,pace yourself there s a lot of walking and try and do a lot of pre planning visit disneyland one day and california adventure on another day be sure to see downtown disney too,4,2017-04-03
3389,The Happiest Place on Earth,we visited disneyland on thanksgiving which i think was probably one of the busiest days at the park since we don t celebrate this holiday in australia i don t think we quite understood its significance the park is open from early about am until midnight it is has been one of my dreams to visit disneyland ever since i was a child and watched the wonderful world on a sunday night being a fan of theme parks i was excited to go to the original and it was the best granted it was quite expensive to get in nearly for a two day pass but it is extremely well run the staff were excellent and so friendly engaging with guests the park was pristine there was no litter anywhere and if a parade had confetti it was cleaned up straight after the food was reasonable in price and they had plenty of fountains to refill your water bottles it was very crowded though i think that had a lot to do with the holiday and there was long lines to go on the most popular rides the rides were worth the wait unlike rides at australian theme parks they go for a long time and are the product of a lot of imagination we went on space mountain the indiana jones ride pirates of the caribbean two boat rides one that went through miniature villages of disney movies including aladdin frozen and a jungle one that went past different animatronic animals we also went on the famous teacups which was part of my childhood dream though the more you spin the faster they go which leads to dizziness there are lots of people that go to disneyland and it seems like many families make it part of the annual vacations with families wearing matching shirts with their names well mum dad nanna little brother and big sister etc on them there were also a lot of people in wheelchairs and mobility scooters that you can hire at the park i m not entirely convinced that all the people using these facilities were actually disabled as those with mobility issues get priority in the lines and take along their family of people along so it seemed to me that it was a sneaky way to not have to wait in the queues which at times were over an hour wait if you are staying at the disney resort there is a complimentary fast pass that allows you to jump the queue for each ride but if you want to go again are given a time at which to return which is fair enough we enjoyed the parade waited nearly hours for the fireworks over the castle which was then cancelled due to the wind though it was not really that windy that was most disappointing as our feet were sore after a big day walking around and if we knew that there was going to be no fireworks we would have gone to either the laser show at the california adventure park which is the sister park or gone back to our accommodation we caught the art bus there which was per adult for day of for days it was a good way to get around anaheim and the drivers were excellent the lady on our way there helped a lady in a wheelchair onto the bus she was very professional i was so happy to be able tick this off my bucket list and i would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting the wonderful world of disney ,5,2017-04-03
3390,A little unhappy.,the good disney still does a lot of things well they have fantastic shows such as fireworks parades and live music everywhere the electric light parade is back and it s fantastic don t miss this but wait for the show and skip the show because it s a lot easier to find a good place to sit yes sit and you can see more the fireworks are also fantastic as usual but get a spot where you can see the castle they now have pictures beamed on the castle like it s a screen so it s cool the old classic rides are still here and are fantastic but the reliable fastpass system seems to have failed when there are huge crowds you have at least a one hour wait in a standby line or you get the fastpass and have to return hours later in some cases the passes were gone very quickly the bad i ve visited this park many times starting in i even had an annual pass one year back in maybe it was because i went during spring break and it was overcrowded and thus it was miserable the rides had mostly hour waits and there were so many people everywhere you went rides broke down daily which just added to the misery i would have to think very hard about visiting again anytime soon and certainly not during spring break never ever ever do this you will be sorry if you can figure out when it s not so packed then please tell the rest of us so we can enjoy this great park ,3,2017-04-03
3391,"Had a great time in Disneyland, along with family.",we went on rides and ate and got character signatures we did so much i was exhausted at the end of the day the kids loved all the different rides as did i and we all got hats some with mouse ears some not and t shirts and stuffed animals as take home mementos there was so much to do it was difficult to make a decision of what to do next the youngest and enrolled in the jedi training and part of that was dueling with darth vader and other characters of the dark side fun fun fun ,5,2017-04-02
3392,Best family trip a must do.,we went during spring break and it was busy but never stood in line for more than min disneyland is the master of lines keeping you entertained while making them look small the three things you will need is the park hopper pass disneyland app and your phone with data the app show closed attractions washrooms length of lines fast pass times and where and when characters can be found fast passes will ensure you do not spend your vacation standing in lines we had our older son who would run ahead and get our fast pass then we would go to the other park and get a fast pass there then we would plan our rides based on lineup times until we could use our fast pass and get another we did days and only had a couple of rides we wanted to do on day and spent allot of the day repeating our favorite ones we rented strollers for the two little girl s and under this is a must because you cover a lot of ground in a day we left all our stuff in the strollers and never had any issues until the last night when someone grabbed the wrong stroller after the fireworks we got all our stuff back the next morning except souvenir cup they throw out any containers that contain or possibly contain liquids disneyland did replace the cup free of charge which was fantastic this trip can be expensive with the dollar exchange but is a must for families my recommendation would be to take kids when they are between an as they can ride almost any ride and they really appreciated the magic of the park ,5,2017-04-01
3393,Disappointing....,we planned a day vacation to disneyland we are serious disney fans but i have to say this was a total let down everything we wanted to ride was broken then we waited for hours for space mountain in the heat then all of a sudden it was down with no estimated time for it to be back up then we heard it had already been down times before we had gotten fast passes to indiana jones everyone gets fast pass another disappointment because then what s the point after we waited for our time which was hours later the ride was down the crowds were ridiculous and it was total chaos we won t be returning here again instead we will stick to the parks in orlando we won t use our day passes at all we opted to go other places ,2,2017-03-30
3394,Worth experience with amusement park,we visited disneyland in anaheim recently and were very disappointed it was our first visit we paid more than k for us and kids for park visit for days waiting for each attraction is minutes average we had a baby and were asked to leave the stroller each time at the beginning of the line for attraction and then i had to carry the baby for minutes in waiting for each attraction bizarre and crazy experience never again the attractions themself very childish and the whole experience wasn t worth the money even close after first day my legs were finished and second day was a complete suffer never again we ll go to disneyland they even didn t have the option to buy front in line pass like universal studios have the universal studios definitely worth the money ,1,2017-03-27
3395,Happiest place of Earth?,i don t know what happened but the cast members are some of the unhappiest people i have ever seen their sullen looks eventually get to you does anyone ever smile here disney markets their disney institute on business improvement yet it appears that they do not practice what they preach too bad it would greatly improve the guests experience to see some cast members who appear to enjoy where they work ,3,2017-03-27
3396,Another great time in Disneyland!,i don t know how many times i ve been to disneyland but i always leave dead tired but happy and wanting to come back again it s been five years since the last time i was here with my family but this time my youngest is older and able to ride the bigger rides that he wasn t able to before with the rest of the family also this time we did a day hopper so we weren t so in a hurry to do everything all in one day i would recommend a multi day pass over a single day pass to disneyland because there s so much to do and not enough time to do it especially during the busy spring break season if it was not so busy maybe a single day pass might work but we re talking about disneyland and it s always busy since i m a star wars nut of course my favorite rides at disneyland are star tours and hyperspace mountain previously space mountain if you get in to the park right when it opens you can ride on star tours lots of times with minimal wait hyperspace mountain still has a wait even when you get in first thing because it s so popular another very popular ride that has long wait times is the indiana jones ride i would recommend getting a fastpass to hyperspace mountain rather than waiting in the long line that way you can get to do something else like star tours before your time for hyperspace mountain comes up i would also get a fastpass for indiana jones then maybe go on the jungle cruise next door another recommendation would be to get the disneyland app because it shows the wait times on your phone so you can plan your rides better it was invaluable to me because it also shows you the closest bathrooms and helps you to take the best paths to a ride when you re lost in a mass of humanity the app has a little blue arrow showing you where you are at that exact moment of course you can go old school and open up the map provided to you at entry and use that of course i will be back again after they open the new star wars land in a couple of years also the new guardians of the galaxy ride in california adventure will open this june i wish it was open while we were there but that s something to look forward to next time so until next time have a great time at the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-03-23
3397,Extremely overcrowded!,had the chance to go back to disneyland and realized how ridiculously overcrowded this place is the rides are decent especially indiana jones but the lines were all well over one hour long extremely overpriced as far as food goes and nothing really special not my favorite place on earth ,3,2017-03-22
3398,Planet Earths happy place!,disney is a masterclass in congeniality from the moment one walks through the gates in the morning to the sad moment one leaves at night one is treated at the pinnacle of hospitality genuine customer care immersed in a grand vision of a world with sadness it is a proud display of the human spirit a promise that we can all believe in namely that life does not always have to be lonely or frightening just step inside and see for yourself i have loved disney since my first visit as a child years ago but love it more today i think as one grows older and inherent childhood innocence is lost one needs its magic even more we have to be reminded to lighten up and just be happy disney does this more than any other organisation ever a day pass is around plus food beverages and souvenirs value wise it can not be beaten the value it brings me is priceless if i could afford it i would have every holiday with disney i would go on a disney cruise stay in their resorts and spend every moment in their parks i have been fortunate enough to have travelled the world and lived a full life but now i realise life is about being happy and having precious moments with the ones you love disney simply put is my happy place ,5,2017-03-21
3399,"Old, Crowded, and Small",we were very excited to visit disneyland after going to a couple other disney parks one being overseas unfortunately we were ultimately disappointed the rides were very dated for most of the park and the workers weren t up to the level that they were at disney world california adventure park on the other hand was very well done and a good experience disneyland is very small and we were debating between going here and universal studios in hindsight we were probably better off going to universal studios in lieu of this but our curiosity got the better of us there are simply too many people and not enough rides the lines are ridiculous which we expected and there is a crazy amount of people there with small infants many less than months old and toddlers with strollers in such a small space disneyland is definitely showing it s age i would skip the park and go to california adventure if you must go to the park the lines are terrible there too but the environment is much nicer ,2,2017-03-20
3400,AWESOME PARK!!! But if you have bigger kids then try California Park.,i loved disneyland park the original disneyland it is filled with all he old school rides that you have heard about over the years like the matterhorn and space mountain these rides are great and seeing the princesses pink castle is a must do however if you have older kids who are thrill seekers then california park is a better choice this park is amazing but more suited to younger kids who want to witness the magical side of disneyland with all of the characters and the star dust and sparkles you could do this park in hours california needs ,4,2017-03-20
3401,Disneyland musings from California mom of preschooler,my husband and i took our three year old son to disneyland this week and for the most part we all had an amazing time thank goodness we planned for afternoon naps back at the hotel every day best decision we ever made of course disneyland is the classic institution of southern california that is the realization of walt disney s dream the castle still stands stalwart in the middle of the park and as a year old woman who grew up coming here over the course of my life i couldn t help but reflect about this place as it operates now in i think i hold a mental model of this park that comes from a little girl s brain from long ago this week what i saw was a small castle an old park with narrow walkways that aren t capable anymore of handling the throngs of people that show up for the nighttime shows the cast members do their best to control the crowds with their light lamps and ropes they hustled us along like cattle at one point where we were ankle to ankle no longer was i able to meander over to storybook land and peruse the shops because when i went storybook land was closed for the fireworks show and i was stuck with a stroller in a massive crowd of people that were being corralled down main street i think that disney has done its best with retrofitting parts of the park and keeping their classic rides current clean and updated that being said the crowd control is very problematic strollers are parked three deep all through tomorrow land and crowds are roped off so that one way traffic can be encouraged all along the tomorrowland walkway i can see how the company is trying to think innovatively about helping people navigate the park and i appreciate that but with star wars land opening next year i can t help but wonder how disney will handle the influx of people especially onto beautiful but tiny little bottlenecked main street one important thing that we learned was how to work the fast pass system without that rides would have been very challenging to get on even in mid march we also had a four day park hopper which allowed us to use the magic morning hour the magic morning allows you to enter the park one hour before opening that was very nice as we were able to walk onto buzz light year s astro blasters ride twice before the park opened this meant a lot to my son finally our experience with the disney characters was spotty at best mickey mouse on main street hurried us through the line and did no interaction with our son it was definitely an assembly line disheartening as he loves mickey mouse it s interesting to see that the days of walking up to a character and getting a picture taken with them are long gone everywhere characters appeared lines of picture takers quickly formed we even waited minutes in line to get a picture with darth vader who ironically was very nice we also found a pattern of curtness with several of the cast members this trip many were still very helpful and sweet to our son though and i want to make sure to mention that after these experiences i can t help wonder why for me some of the larger questions loom how is this company building it s culture for its employees what is their morale like why are the characters hesitant to dive in and interact why are they moving kids through the lines so quickly there was something sad about that to me something that speaks of a very subtle loss of culture for this timeless and classic los angeles amusement park that has always been loved by so many surprisingly it was a totally different vibe at california disney we got a fast pass for world of color which we would highly recommend the crowd control here was much better we had plenty of room to stand in our assigned location there are open eateries all through california disney making lines short and food highly accessible plenty of seating areas and the rides were extremely well run the park was clean and the rides carried that beautiful imaginative spirit of disney but were much more modern and the way they were designed the cast members of california disney were consistently courteous professional and friendly some of the pluses of our overall experience splash mountain thunder mountain railroad pirates of the caribbean are all still running beautifully my son loved them loved buzz light year s astro blasters and of course peter pan we love the fried chicken at the plaza inn on main street as for california disney we would highly recommend the nighttime show world of color the ferris wheel is magnificent and the redwood ropes course is great for little kids with some careful planning some strategic use of the fast pass system and some expectations for some big crowds you can still have a fantastic time at disneyland even in ,4,2017-03-18
3402,Too crowded for fun,the wait for the attractions rides were way too long the crowds made it difficult to get around wasted my time ,4,2017-03-16
3403,Easy Going - not as busy as Disney World,we took our year son and he loved it the perfect age for him to experience disney star wars thunder railroad buzz light year haunter mansion space mountain perfect for his age clean bathrooms a few rides were closed if you are looking for an option to disney world and you only want to spend one day this is the best option ,5,2017-03-15
3404,Classic Disney,no fireworks show during the week was a bummer the castle was much smaller but overall the park had the same good disney feel the lines were average and the fast pass is not yet linked up to a bracelet or computer reservations it s still done by inserting your admission ticket into the kiosks and getting a return time ticket and is included with admission ,4,2017-03-13
3405,Love Disney...but!,third time at disneyland this time only for days we love disneyland but this time we were left underwhelmed there were are lot of rides not going the crowds were ridiculous it was not holiday times and mid week and ride times were easily over hours in some cases even the staff commented on how busy it was the food was typical to these venues a bit overpriced all the same and a bit tasteless the souvenirs can be expensive but you can get some disney approved from walmart for a lot less if you shop around staff were great as usual and it s still the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-03-12
3406,Love Disneyland!,what bad things are there to say about disneyland this is the third year we have been annual pass holders we love going to disneyland i really don t even know why they need reviews it is such a magical place our daughter is now two and this trip was so much fun to watch her light up with all the characters your cast members are truly amazing and give an added enjoyment to the parks thank you ,5,2017-03-08
3407,Disneyland; The Magic Kingdom not so Magical!,as a long time disney theme park visitor and a huge disney fan i am saddened to say how disappointed i am to have to rate the park so low the chaos may be partly to blame for the massive amount of construction and overhaul the park is currently undergoing it is difficult to understand why decisions to close some bathroom facilities for rehab while not providing additional options were made closing down the train that moves people from one side of the park to the other is also a very bad move people can barely get around most hours of the day and several ride closures complicated things further there aren t enough places for people to sit and rest and the fast pass system is antiquated and there isn t a system in place to allow people to exchange a pass if a ride breaks during their allotted time the situation during the parade times is dangerous there is absolutely no way an emergency situation can be handled i can t recommend a visit until all construction as been completed ,2,2017-03-07
3408,Family Vacation,this was our third time visiting disneyland never gets old we had the magic morning and took advantage to ride space mountain and indiana jones we went during the month of february and we had an awesome time perfect weather we love disneyland and if you do not like to be around people and crowded places this is not the place for you ,4,2017-03-06
3409,Simply Disneyland,wonderful for everyone disneyland is the place for everyone to become kids again and live a like in a dream this park is nicer than the one in florida because it is in the middle of the city in a walking distance to hotels and restaurants ,5,2017-03-05
3410,More hype than its worth,this was my first time to disneyland and i doubt i ll return way too expensive for what it is and does not accommodate adults which seems stupid as adults have to go to take their small children the only exciting adult ride was the rollercoaster in disney california park the staff weren t happy or helpful think it s rude to make people wait longer to enter if they aren t staying at the disney hotels considering you end up spending about for entry food and transport great for kids useless for adults ,2,2017-03-05
3411,Disney Magic Fading?,disneyland has always held a great spot in my heart and the dedication put on the experience was amazing around every corner there was something to smile about and if there was a tear in a young child s eye they were there with a sticker pin or some disney magic to ensure you left smiling coming back this year i would have to say i was disappointed we spent a week dropping in to both parks and found it was not up to the standards the used to have not sure if this was a timing thing or a bad week but we frequently heard people say and saw the garbage cans overflowing the were disney personal standing around not in the spirit and crowds that seemed in managed it seemed this trip it was about packing as many people in as possible and not about keeping a good experience one example was rides maintenance one day alone we were in li e for four different rides that come down with no option for a fast pass or something after waiting an hour or more now i know disney needs to make money but they used to be know for the best experience as well and i worried they are losing that it is still an ok place to visit but it is not what it once was i m hopeful this is a minor setback and they are working to fix things if so i would love to go back ,3,2017-03-04
3412,The Magic is Missing!,my husband and i have visited disneyland at least once each year for the past years with our young children we re finding a big drop in quality in the last three years just not worth it anymore for the expense overcrowded at times we have previously known to be very reasonable enjoyable times to visit too many attractions closed at one time cast member knowledge friendliness and magic not up to par we got false information on several occasions ,2,2017-03-02
3413,Fantastic!,disneyland california is absolutely amazing first time visiting this park and i was blown away the staff are the nicest happiest people and make the experience that much better it happened to be my birthday when i visited and just about every staff member i passed said happy birthday and sang birthday songs for me there is so much to see and do in the park you ll never be bored make sure to stay for the electrical parade it s a sight to see ,5,2017-03-01
3414,Still the happiest place on Earth,altough the lines were long due to winter break at schools we still had a great time tips go to the attractions that you wanted early or late the park is busiest form to plan your fast passes aroung long wait times in line that way you wait in one line for two rides note star wars land under construction planned opening is per park employees ,5,2017-02-27
3415,Truly the happiest place on earth!,okay i am a grown adult with a husband and three small children and i could not help but get all giddy while visiting disneyland our kids had a blast but my husband is convinced that i had the most fun of all we stayed at the park from open to close with only a short break for little legs to get back to the hotel to take a rest and i could have gone even longer we were bummed that matterhorn and some of the other bigger rides were closed but we still had every bit as much fun as we would have otherwise use fastpass as much as you can and bring food snacks because eating at the park gets pricey ,5,2017-02-27
3416,Tips for Disneyland Trip,recommendations buy some disney clothes on advance since those are almost double or triple priced inside disneyland buy some glow light chains or rods for kids bigger the better kids love to carry electric bubble wands you might want to carry one if you already have a one wear sports shoes carry ponchos for rides like splash mountain check the attractions which are only valid on certain days like water color which happens on sat sun and monday first get fast passes and then go for rides many of the adventure park ride s fast passes finish before o clock carry some fruits snacks along the queue can sometimes be long for food some of the rides are similar in nature you might want to choose one of them instead of going to all similar ones we loved the photo pass we could get many family photos with a good quality camera by it before starting your first day if you see a small queue for a character you can quickly get one clicked the queue for getting photos clicked can also be very long we bought a nice minnie mouse hair band but it was lost on the second day i personally felt that i could buy a pack of such head bands in advance from amazon kids just want a head band not necessarily the expensive ones headbands were mostly between dollars to dollars inside disneyland ,5,2017-02-26
3417,Still great but crowded,this is a great park to visit but it has become very crowded even on low attendance days it is a hard one to maneuver i use a scooter ecv for mobility many times i had to just stop and let people with their noses in their phones pass don t plan on many rides in a day lines on even less popular rides are now minutes or more the live shows are still best part of the park ,4,2017-02-25
3418,Wait until the renovations are complete,they have large portions of the park under construction this forces more people into smaller areas making it seem very crowded for a mid week in february the lines averaged about minutes asian because a good number of rides were closed space mountain broke down several times like that is news the new star tours ride is shorter but still fun save your trip until things reopen ,4,2017-02-24
3419,Just to tick it off✅ the list,it a took a solid day to complete just this park started at am til about pm the park is open til pm with fireworks over the weekend we bought a day pass we planned a day in each of the two parks and the third day was a catch up or make up day for rides that we were unable to ride due to waiting times as expected its busy long long waiting times anywhere between mins on our visit my golden advise is pick the rides that will best suit you or your kids interests and age disneyland park is good for the yr olds star wars rides also feature here best ride was the star wars tour ride a great simulation ride take a fast pass it helps get through the rides but you can only do this once for the time slot allotted ie it doesn t work on multiple rides in that theme park if u have the hopper pass you could fast pass in each park it will be quite a dash between parks food is overpriced purchase of water is a get rich scheme i paid usd for ml water coffee was expensive crap good that the park employs pensioners but they are rude and make the happiest place on earth miserable cos they can t tolerate excited kids loud music perhaps the heat grumpy grumpy grumpy best describes their overall appeal ironic i know the indiana jones ride and big mt were worth the wait need for more modern technologically advanced rides to suit the advanced generations the lanyard with disney character badges is another scam to make millions in a day those very same grumpy pensioners don t have the patience for indecisive kids who are not sure which badge to swap overall we are glad we have ticket the disneyland experience of our son s bucket list enjoy folks ,4,2017-02-22
3420,"STILL A MAGIC PLACE, DESPITE DISNEY GREED IN SMASHING SO MANY PEOPLE INTO THIS PARK.",disneyland is of course wonderful but you really have to be intrepid to survive the horrific crowds that disney somehow manages to jam in there if you want to ride anything go in the morning the food has gotten a bit better but it s also expensive so be ready for that prepare to wait in line for long periods of time take advantage of the fast pass and single rider systems and try not to get pissed when it seems like rides are arbitrarily closed disneyland is so heavily visited they don t need to care about your feelings also i do not recommend this park for really young children and babies they don t understand what it is they are supposed to enjoy and the lines and weather are an absolute torture to them if the screaming is anything to judge by ,4,2017-02-18
3421,"Everyone already knows, but the waiting......ugh",we saw zero characters while we were in disney on sunday pirates was closed we waited minutes in the hyperspace mountain line and then were told that the ride had some sort of an issue and we could either wait if we wanted or stay knowing that there was no foreseeable time frame of the ride being fixed we waited for minutes and were told by the crew member that they were back up everyone cheered and then minutes later a woman came on the intercom and said the ride was still down so we decided to ditch and get food since we had a kid in tow so about minutes waiting on a ride that the disney app said min dunno why peter pan s ride has such a ludicrous wait time saw a couple celebrities on dumbo which was cool fast passes were super beneficial for haunted mansion really what can be said that people don t already know don t go on peter pan get the fp for hyperspace mtn early parade of lights was ok the kid loved it people started getting seating spots hours ahead of time the staff tried to kick us out of the waiting area while we were looking for seating hours prior to the show saying they were full we squeezed in behind a couple generous europeans minutes before the show after they told everyone to go away and wait for the show they tell everyone to move forward to make more room sooooo don t listen to the staff disney is disney everyone knows about the waits but we went on rides in a full day even with utilizing the fp system not worth the price of entry not even close disney has their marketing down pat the park sucks other than to get people s wallets open and to wait ridiculous amounts of time to ride mediocre outdated minute long rides ,3,2017-02-18
3422,Family trip,taking the kids to disneyland for the very first time i think disneyland is over rated for the amount we paid for tickets food drinks etc its almost too expensive to take the kids to disneyland they don t have front of the line passes and at lease rides were not working for the amount of money we paid for tickets hotel gas food and gifts we could have went on a day cruise trip with everything paid for ,5,2017-02-18
3423,So. Much. Fun!,oh well it s disneyland the cast members really make this place fantastic while there was a lot of people here the atmosphere was positive and friendly oh and thank you disney for taking over star wars we saw things we would never have seen if left in lucas hands ,5,2017-02-15
3424,Disney in December,this was a work vacation for me with the family my husband and kids had a great time and didn t want to go home disney was great as always with rides and all of the lo cal food options thanks disney and anaheim ,5,2017-02-06
3425,The gold standard for theme parks,disneyland is our family s favorite vacation destination some of our family s best vacation memories are from our disneyland trips there s something for everyone as our kids get older they have discovered new interests as well as enjoying old favorites the cast members are friendly and keep the park immaculate yes the prices are high but you get what you pay for be sure to utilize the fast pass system to minimize your wait time for popular attractions we love visiting in the off season when the crowds are low and weather is cooler ,5,2017-02-05
3426,Think you wouldn't stand in a line for 2 hours? Disneyland can show you how!,don t get me wrong we had a great time but i d suggest getting your head around the fast pass early on and go as early as you can we got through space mountain indiana jones and star wars early on and lucky we did later in the day there was a hour wait for those rides but pretty much if it does have a long line it s definitely worth the wait we did disneyland park and california adventure park in the same day but it did take us hours to get through and there was a lot of stuff we skipped but i felt like we got the most out of the two in the one day ,4,2017-02-04
3427,Magical,we love disneyland the cleanliess and friendly staff make the park even more enjoyable we look forward to visiting the parks again this spring ,5,2017-02-03
3428,Crowds were crazy,this was our second trip to disneyland in the last two years and we intentionally went in the middle of the week during the off season to avoid the intense crowds we experienced during our last trip in april after waiting in long lines for rides food bathrooms and having to plow through huge crowds to get anywhere this trip a staff member said there is no off season anymore we love disneyland but the magic is definitely diminished by the crowds in the end i felt the massive crowds combined with strollers everywhere really presents a significant safety issue for the guests this will be our last trip to disney ,3,2017-01-28
3429,Really the happiest place earth.,i love this place i go several times a year i can be a kid again with my year old i will be back again in april ,5,2017-01-26
3430,Fun but not as great as Disneyworld!,i love disney i was thrilled to go back after years away the rides and atmosphere did not disappoint if i am comparing disneyland to disneyworld disneyworld wins hands down the cast members as so much better at wdw there were a few at disneyland that stood out but overall they just seemed to be bothered to be doing their job i am the first to admit that i don t love my job everyday but this is the happiest place on earth and with most of the cast it didn t seem that way now darth vader was awesome and i m not even a star wars fan ,4,2017-01-24
3431,Holiday Time at Disneyland Tour,i love disneyland and everything disney but had never tried a tour with them i took my parents who are in their s along with my husband and myself we are in our s for the holiday season we decided to take the holiday tour it was a bit pricey at per person but we thought we would try it basically you walk around with a guide where everyone else walks we would have thought they would take us a way the huge crowds wouldn t be able to access a bit of the information was interesting but the majority was explaining the holiday rides which they didn t take us on and we were told we should ride them on our own time we thought from what we read we would be going on the rides major disappointment trying to keep the group together with all the huge crowds in the park was difficult even as adults we were bored and you would stop at random places that had no significance or anything holiday related quite a bit basically the only reason to take this tour is to for reserved seats for parade those were nice and the guide was nice the hot chocolate was great and the gingerbread man but not worth the price it does save time waiting for the parade and having to stand but either way you waste time either walking around in the tour or waiting in a spot for a parade nothing special you see that you can t see on your own i wouldn t recommend to anyone unless you just want to pay for reserved seating it would have been more worthwhile if they took us on the holiday rides ,2,2017-01-23
3432,Not enough time in the day.,i ve never been to any of the disney parks but from what i understood this is a lot smaller than disney world if that s the case i ll have to book a week in disney world because we would need at least a couple days here if i might make a recommendation get there right at the start of the day the lines get super long super fast you ll be waiting they have stroller rentals which i was so thankful for i went with a month old and a year old we were there while star wars was huge we got to take pics with the different star wars characters ride into space and get bossed around by storm troopers it was so fun we spent a great deal of time chasing the different characters around getting autographs taking pictures of them we were able to purchase all the professional shots the park took of my family with each of the characters not cheap but so worth it it costs a lot to eat in the park prepare yourself for that but there were sooooooo many options for whatever we craved the mexican place we found was fantastic of course the lines to the rides were redonkulous we spent a lot of time waiting but that was also expected again just another thing to plan for but at least they tell you ahead of time how long you ll be waiting so you can time it out or get a call when it s your turn to ride should you choose to do that we can t wait to visit again the staff there were so kind and helpful when we needed them all around a great day ,5,2017-01-22
3433,Not exactly the happiest place on earth!,the lines the prams the crowds enough already though the rides are good the wait times can get ridiculous the food options are limited and we crave fresh options but mostly everything is fried or laden with sugar whilst the fast passes are a great idea and we utilised them they re not exactly fair on others just too manic for my liking and this is my nd visit ,3,2017-01-22
3434,No fun when it's too crowded!,it will cost so use crowd tracking sites or apps to avoid crowded days and insanely long lines ,3,2017-01-18
3435,Boo Disneyland,while i truly love disneyland and all things disney i did not renew my annual pass very sad to say that but it s become so over crowded that the wait time for some rides has reached two to three hours my last visit saw the park reach capacity and they actually stopped letting people in at a certain point you could barely move with so many people there they still maintain the level of cleanliness and customer service it s just too crowded to pay the prices and not get to enjoy yourself i hope they do something about this so things will be different going forward ,3,2017-01-17
3436,Biggest souvenir shop on earth!!,we perhaps got this wrong but disneyland didn t really offer much for our and year old sons there are only the five or six rides which after substantive waiting times were a little underwhelming to the point where my wife who gets scared on a ferris wheel found them comfortable again the park is beautifully presented and laid out and ideal for younger kids and disney tragics just not the place for older kids and the young at heart looking for challenging rides no problems trying to find a disney souvenir or feed as the bulk of the buildings are dedicated to gift shops and eateries ,2,2017-01-16
3437,Download the app and get there early,i ll keep this short disneyland is awesome my tips are get there early like before the gates open prior to going download the disneyland app and have a look at which rides have the longest wait times that way when you get there at opening time make a rush to those rides with the longest waits as we found there was not as many people first thing in the morning also try and get fast passes where possible we found by getting there first thing in the morning within a couple of hours we had done all the rides with the larger wait times we then had the luxury of cruising around doing all the smaller rides in the afternoon ,5,2017-01-14
3438,Wet and rainy but still had a great day.,have just spent the day at disneyland having only one day we decided to go to the original park and we weren t disappointed the weather was miserable so we bought ponchos the night before for they are inside and we wore them for most of the day here are my tips for a great day get there early just incase we were told that it opened at am but at the gates were open and the rides were going at am people arrived and it was suddenly busy maybe disney felt sorry for us arriving in the pouring rain we waited on average mins for each ride so aim for a day when the weather is not perfect as this may deter some people head straight to hyperspace mountain and then grab your first fastpass try to get your rides done in the morning take some snacks so you only have to buy lunch food is pretty average you can ride on the rides with your backpack water bottles can be refilled around the park most people are helpful friendly and there to have a great day everyone was patient particularly in the bad weather staff were fine but i have read that other reviews say they are rude we didnt encounter this at all queues moved well and were organised enjoy ,5,2017-01-13
3439,Christamas at Disneyland,well you got to love disneyland everything about it was wonderful except the fast food not great but let s face it that s the last thing your there for we spend days in disneyland and had a ball at night the place lights up and is so beautiful you always have a smile on your face the happiest place on earth it is a must do and christmas time is a special time we stayed in anaheim at the hotel indigo close and doesn t break the budget short walk to disneyland and walk the other way to lots of restaurants we booked ticket thur viator and went to the ticket office and had a issue getting the tickets sorted but star were great and we had it fixed and off we went it is a must do,5,2017-01-08
3440,A magic place in the word,i went to this magic place more that times in my life i made marriage proposal to my wife in this place in front of the castle now i have a little girl years old and she love it my favority time to visit disney is christmas all the employees are nice and very polite now with my baby i see another way this park but always my favorites shows are fireworks and all the parades be careful using your fast past this can give you a lot of help but need to be smart to used look very carefull the return times to the games start tours indiana jones pirates haunted house space mountain are some of the best rides of the park ,5,2017-01-05
3441,Just as good as Orlando,this was our first trip to disneyland and i d heard it was small compared to orlando but it seemed large to me we had three days to cover both parks and it was just enough there s something special about knowing this is the original park and even though some attractions are a bit old now they re all very well maintained and i thought disneyland was as good as disney world s magic kingdom ,5,2017-01-02
3442,We had a blast!,my son almost and i visited on the first sunday of october we got there before the gate opened so we were ready to go right off the bat we went to star tours first thing to get a fast pass but the line wasn t very long so my son went ahead and rode we met some nice people in line and they allowed him to ride with their kids that way i didn t have to worry about him while he was riding i stayed with him until he boarded then they allowed me to walk through and wait on the other side i was afraid he might get scared but he didn t we then went to get him signed up for jedi training he got one of the last spots available later in the day we then went to get a fast pass for splash mountain but ended up just going on the ride as the long was really short we both loved it we took ponchos so we weren t worried about being wet first thing in the morning after that we got a fast pass for big thunder mountain then went to jungle cruise which we both loved our guide was so funny i know it is a script but she was fabulous that was a pretty long line but we got it over with early we did autopia twice first time together the second time he drove his own car and he did much better it s a small world did not disappoint line wasn t outrageous and moved pretty quickly it has been years since i went to disneyworld so i was excited to go on this ride again we also loved the teacup ride and did it probably about times he didn t think he would enjoy it but loved it especially when we really got it spinning pretty fast that line was short so we got through it pretty quick he spent some time in the kiddie land area then we rode the gadget go coaster big thunder mountain we did fairly early in the morning and i loved it more than i thought i was a little nervous about it due to back issues but it wasn t a problem at all i would have gone again but he wasn t up for it he was a little pale when we got off and kept saying he was going to throw up while on it after he sat down for a couple of minutes he was fine and ready to go don t miss the apple freeze with boysenberry that is possibly one of the best drinks i have ever had and my son agreed we split a corn dog and fries got water to drink which is free so that was a pretty cheap lunch we also had a churro pretzel and pineapple whip only spent around on food for the day and were well satisfied because we were so busy the jedi training show was so good even if my child wouldn t have been participating i had no idea what to expect i thought they were just going to be showing them some moves boy was i surprised he got to fight darth vader the photographer got better photos than i did so i was pleased with that the photo pass is pretty cool however we only saw photographer however we had the jedi training photos the ones at the castle and then our ride photo i made a mistake by not downloading the photos when i purchased them i didn t know they didn t stay on there until you were ready to download fortunately when i called i got a sweet girl who found my photos and made them available for me to download don t miss the light in the window at the fire station on main street near the entrance that light now stays on all the time when walt disney was alive that light was on whenever he was at the park very nice tribute all in all we had a great time were there longer than we thought we would be which was completely fine and would go back again if we had the chance ,5,2017-01-01
3443,Trip of a lifetime!,we visited disneyland with two married children and eight of our grandchildren the only thing that would have made it better would have been if all of our children and grandchildren could have come disneyland is the ultimate place for our family and to visit at christmas time made it even better disney really knows how to celebrate ,5,2016-12-30
3444,Happu,great place start your day at the back of the park that way you ll get to ride more go on a colder day that way you ll get to go on everything best ride haunted house worst wasn t any ,5,2016-12-29
3445,Fun for young and old,we spent a whole sunday in the park take the fast pass as often as possible in weekends it s very busy and lines are long ,5,2016-12-28
3446,Very disappointed,i visited disneyland for the first time ever on dec with my two sons ages and the place was really beautiful but and here comes the disappointment we paid for both parks one day and got to go on rides it was so packed and most lines had at least min waiting lines i would never go back again ,2,2016-12-28
3447,Need new rides,i have been to disneyland so many time and i am a big disney fan however i feel that it needs some upgrade in term of technology i think it is falling behind i feel that we should be able to reserve all fastpass online why do we still need to carry a hard copy of our ticket around we should be able to us the soft copy in our phone disneyland app isn t very user friendly and it would be nice if there are free wifi in the park the wait time in disney app is inaccurate at this point in time they should be able to digitally link the wait time display at the rides gates to their app already disney is very behind in term of technology ,3,2016-12-28
3448,Our 1st family trip to Disneyland!,the mere fact that this is disneyland and the nostalgia that comes with walking down main street and imagining walt himself taking those same steps is enough to make this park magical the experience of disneyland at christmas time was wonderful the rides were great and i have to admit some were better than their counterparts at disney world pirates of the caribbean and splash mountain but i must say that we were a little disappointed with the cast members and how incredibly rude some of the guests were we are dvc members and have always had wonderful experiences with cast members at disney world but for some reason here they seamed irritated and hurried not many smiles waves or kind words some of the park guests were using foul language while pushing strollers and almost knocking people over to get in line for rides i found that to be very unnecessary and inappropriate for a disney environment there was trash on the ground in front of several quick service areas and many outside tables were not cleaned off i really wanted disneyland to be as good if not better than disney world unfortunately i can not say that it is the fastpass system here is very limiting and not executed well again overall this is a wonderful place to experience the magic of disney i just really wish the cast members would try to remember why we are all here to have fun and make lasting disney memories with our families our favorite part of the park besides rides was the beautiful lighting ceremony of sleeping beauty castle the christmas decorations were breathtaking and seeing the castle at night was enough in itself to make the trip worth while i would recommend to anyone to give disneyland a chance and give themselves the opportunity to enjoy a disney vacation definitely do some planning in terms of crowds wait times fastpass times and dining i have no doubt that sometime in the future we will be coming back and hopefully get to enjoy the disneyland we always envisioned ,4,2016-12-22
3449,Glitchy,i ve been to disneyland and california adventure a number of times over the years mostly with my kids if i d rated them i d have given all prior visits a i really do fall for that happiest place on earth motto this latest trip days with kids and their friends was peculiar by the end of our trip we were up to fails on attractions and by fail i mean standing in line for a half hour or more and then having the attraction closed due to problems times that s a lot of disappointment for over per person worth of tickets and experiencing so many ride closures made me realize that disney is not very good about handling them no good announcements that can be heard by everyone in line no easy way to exit lines when things close very poor management of fast pass vs regular folks when ride throughput dropped precipitously having marveled at how good disney is with people flow i was quite taken aback by how badly it broke down when things went awry but is harsh i love the parks during the holidays the festive decorations add a magical touch and i ll no doubt return in spite of this experience but disney needs to improve the reliability of their attractions and figure out how to better handle the crowds when things break down ,3,2016-12-21
3450,Christmas Time is amazing,so many christmas decorations the place looked spectacular worth going this time of year as the rides were all caterer towards you too he festive season days was enough for a family with teenagers we made the most of the fast passes which were great remember you can only use fast pass per person at a time so use the ones with the shortest come back on time first it gets you through in mins ,5,2016-12-20
3451,Magical and romantic,we visit every year and christmas to celebrate the anniversary of my proposal in front of the cinderella castle the park has photographers to capture the moment adult dining in the park at blue bayou usually requires reservations if you want alchohol get your hand stamped and leave the park for a short walk to downtown disney for several great dining venues and return to the park download the disney app for ride wait times use fast pass when you can don t miss the lighting of the castle or evening parade ,5,2016-12-17
3452,Always a big day out,disneyland is always a great day out it is a fun place to go to we have been many times the last few visits we are finding it overcrowded and difficult to get onto many of the rides without investing significant time lining up i believe this is due to the number of annual pass holders in attendance having traveled from australia at great expense it is disappointing to pay such an expensive entry price only to spend a lot of our time in the park in lines waiting to go into an attraction i don t have a solution only comment we really enjoy disneyland but will not visit again for quite some time as it does not represent value for money to us ,4,2016-12-15
3453,Disneyland,fantastic parks get there in the morning as the first few hours are quiet and allow you to maximise your rides and fast passes ,5,2016-12-14
3454,Magical trip!,this was my rd trip to disneyland this year and it did not disappoint we were able to get on just about every ride we wanted thanks to fastpass we discovered a couple quickservice restaurants that i hadn t tried before that we quick tasty and reasonably priced be sure to get a bag of beignets in new orleans square at the mint julep bar to die for the decorations for christmas were beautiful and the fireworks show with the holiday music was a nice change we watched the fireworks from new orleans square facing the riverboat and thunder mountain we had a great view and a special treat to see the dancing water show and the cinnamon scented snowflakes falling at the end renting a locker was worth the but you have to do it early in the day or it will sell out stay hydrated bring snacks and a jacket because it does get chilly at night this time of year we didn t buy a photo pass but i wish we had for the professional photographer to capture the special moments ,5,2016-12-13
3455,Back after a very very long time! (Two Decades),this theme park is amazing all rides are amazing and staff is always kind went by myself and had the time of my life ,5,2016-12-13
3456,California Screamin'!,great time at disney once again have been to disney in us france and japan there are parks disneyland and california adventure for california adventure california screamin and radiator spring racers are a must grab the fastpass fp as soon as you get to the park as the queue particularly for racers can get really long when i was there a sunday the wait time was min but with fp wait time was only about minutes for disneyland there are lots of rides to go for from big thunder mountain to star wars tour to hyperspace mountain grab fp if possible to cut wait times which can get to minutes without fp great time for the family young kids and staff are super friendly and always helpful happiest place on earth ,5,2016-12-11
3457,Love love love!!!,disneyland is awesome i like it better than disney world for several reasons the characters are more accessible to the public without waiting in crazy long lines several of the rides are better one being pirates of the caribbean it has a drop at disneyland and not at disney world cars land is amazing california adventure is like no where else on earth and is spectacular for many reasons ,5,2016-12-11
3458,Best day ever!,christmas holiday is the best time of year to visit the park so much joy and happiness all around and the lights all around the park and outside the park are just spectacular ,5,2016-12-10
3459,"Good, but not as good as it used to be",it s a great albeit expensive day out cheaper if you do a few days and make it a park hopper a minimum of three days is required to get the most out of the two parks or a couple of days if you re just doing this one fast passes fp are a must as is arriving early to hit the popular rides in this park it s usually indy and or pirates that have longer wait times so grab a fp for indy no fp for pirates and get on with your day the food as you d expect is pricey so if your watching your dollars get subway or maybe something from cvs better selection of healthy stuff than walgreens before you go to the park and if you have or can find one keep it in a soft cool bag do you don t get sick keep an eye on parade times as many rides are easier to get on then especially kids rides use the app it s pretty helpful to figure out where to go next for both parks lastly if you re close by head back home around mid late afternoon to relax have some cheaper and probably healthier dinner in preparation for the night session including a great fireworks display fyi haunted should be back to normal around january ,4,2016-12-09
3460,Meca for all Disney fans,this was our first trip to disneyland since we re from the east coast disney world is where we tend to go disneyland is feels much smaller and the castle is really small most of the rides are the same but usually slightly different that may sound negative but that s the reason we wanted to visit disneyland to see what was different original it was well worth it we were with our teens and in day were able to see and ride everything at least once some more than once ,5,2016-12-09
3461,Take me back to Orlando!,we were so disappointed by our visit we love visiting the disney parks in orlando this one is no comparison this location is a cramped park with tons of rude people and long lines not fun ,2,2016-12-09
3462,It's Disney,this was my first time to disneyland i have been to disney world and i was not disappointed the park as always is spotless and it is very easy to get around we really enjoyed our late afternoon experience we had a good meal at blue bayou we did get stuck on the pirates of the carribean ride for a short time but park employees where very helpful in getting us of the ride and on our way they did make up for the time we spent waiting with some express ride passes so that was very nice the star wars theme d area was also a lot of fun ,5,2016-12-07
3463,Worst 2 days of California trip,started our week california road trip with day park hopper disney visit from uk been to orlando several times thought we had to do this where it all began wish we hadn t bothered not enough rides too crowded expensive signage under control of yr olds no fireworks show either day we were there due to halloween party early closing nearly paid for dining package to secure places for world of colour it s ok with fastpass viewing area right in middle left but after minutes us kids bored radiator springs racer soaring around the world both with fastpass grizzlie river run best on offer so disappointing glad rest of trip only got better if you ve been to disney world don t waste time money here ,2,2016-12-06
3464,Under construction avoid til 2018 or until the construction is completed,half the park closed with the same amount of people a stand in line most of the time its to bad they let in so many people that you can hardly move in the park line even at the bathrooms ,3,2016-12-04
3465,Okay Experience,i ve been to disneyland several times before what i really liked is that many of the attractions were updated with holiday themes so you didn t feel like you were seeing the same ride experience as usual the decorations are beautiful and they even made is snow on the main street our trip fell below expectations on several occasions according to the disneyland app alice was supposed to be at a location from to she is my daughters favorite character we waited that entire time and she did not arrive it also wasn t clear where she would be standing at about she came waltzing through the area quickly as if she couldn t stay apparently she was late for a very important date with an app it should be easy to update the times and let people know plans have changed etc thankfully my daughter got some photos with her but it still was disappointing she was rushing through they also cancelled the fireworks on thanksgiving evening which was sort of understandable but they said they would make it snow over the loud speaker several times and never did we waited and nothing magic diminished finally please they need to start doing fastpass like orlando does trying to find the fastpass lines was often troublesome and then there would be minute waits for those being able to go online to schedule and then approaching one kiosk to get fastpasses for any ride is a huge help for families overall we love disney though ,3,2016-11-30
3466,I was overwhelmed at first,i read books and got tons of advice from friends before we left but it did little to prepare me for disneyland on a saturday it took about hours for me to get a handle on it we didn t know or had forgotten that we needed our passports to get our tickets so our day started with a trip back to the hotel then there were so many people but once i got over those things got our first fastpass the best thing ever use them i fell in love with the place we were a group of aged and we all loved it my year old dad went on as many rides as the kids i read the unofficial guide to disneyland and i highly recommend it so many amazing tips don t skip a ride because your friend s kids didn t like it or didn t want to do it our kids tastes were different than our friends the price of food and treats weren t as expensive as we were told we bought our kids shirts and keychains magnets for their friends at target way cheaper buy mouse ears asap even your teenagers will wear them this was a once in a lifetime trip for us and we loved it ,5,2016-11-29
3467,EXCELLENT Park....DO NOT recommend visiting during Thanksgiving week!,disneyland measured up to all of our expectations it is a wonderful place to visit we traveled during thanksgiving week tue wed thurs and it was sooo busy we traveled to disney world a few years ago over the same time period and even though there were definitely crowds it was nothing like this year the park was at capacity on tuesday i highly recommend using your fast passes wisely and getting them early in the day fast passes are not additional they come with your pass of any kind use them we ran into so many people that thought they were an extra cost or were only for certain type of pass holders no use them early and wisely it will definitely help you get the most out of your day ,4,2016-11-27
3468,Disney 2016,unfortunately the park was very crowded the wait period to get on the rides was at least minutes although disneyland is a magical place the lines to buy food get on rides and watch the parades is overwhelming i loved the christmas themes but definitely you need alot of patience i believe for the price it is very unfortunate you really don t get your monies worth i saw alot of children crying because they were tired if awaiting in lines definitely a challenge for parents as a couple we did enjoy walking around and enjoying the atmosphere ,3,2016-11-24
3469,Current construction and ride down time are big negatives,don t get me wrong at i am a disney fanatic and i have been since i first went at the age of having said that i must admit that the current construction has made it very difficult to get from one place to another losing the back way from frontierland to fantasyland and having the railroad shut down has pushed a lot of traffic back into the heart of the park this made it feel as busy as it has ever been even though the dlr app rated our days there as out of it is especially bad when there are parades since the only way to move around pushes you back through the center of the park in addition i have never had so many rides shutdown for maintenance throughout the day i really felt like we did not receive the value for the amount we paid to get into the park i would hope that disney would reduce their prices during this time so you get a more fair value for what you pay to get in i know i m dreaming california adventure was fine and we had none of the problems we experienced in disneyland obviously i will return to disneyland but probably not until a year after the current construction is finished i imagine that first year after the new land opens is going to be packed ,3,2016-11-23
3470,A little run down,just got back and will never go to this disney again disney world is better disneyland is worn out and dated needs major up lift landscaping needs more color like hanging baskets and more flowers every place and the worse is the season ticket holds that live in the park real gheto employees need to smale and stop talking to other employess and work more ,3,2016-11-19
3471,Fun but soooo busy, parents young teen girls tips we wish we had known beforehand book dinner at blue bayou in pirates of the carribbean and ariels grotto for the awesome world of colour show when you book your flights they start taking bookings days ahead and were completely booked when we arrived november is not low season november is still hot it was of tips we learned enjoy a mint julep at the new orleans area and watch fireworks in comfort ride as singles on matterhorn go first thing ride your favourites then take a break back at the hotel to rev up for nighttime skip fireworks on busy days it got busier at night you could barely walk through the crowds download the disney app to track lowest wait times don t miss frozen ,4,2016-11-15
3472,Day trip to Anaheim,i was in anaheim for a day am pm and thought i would check it out since i love disney so much the food drinks and souvenirs are definitely not worth the price they are charging most of the attractions i found were for young kids and the wait times for the rides were an hour or more ,2,2016-11-14
3473,Lost its magic.,we have been to disneyland many many times this last visit was the worst for per ticket one should be able to ride more than rides a day the crowds were horrendous thinking that it may have been close to capacity the fast pass system is a broken system the passes are dispersed and sold out at the beginning of the day and the returns allow too many people to use fast pass this makes the wait times even longer hoping that this is our last disney trip ,2,2016-11-14
3474,Just as I remembered,i grew up in southern california and have visited disneyland many times i left california thank god a decade ago and don t miss much about it but it was a pure joy to bring my two year old daughter to disneyland and let her experience what i grew up with sure there are some changes from years ago but the magic is still there yes it s expensive but the law of economics is supply and demand if you think it s busy now imagine if they still charged to get in you d get on one ride every two hours and you d be miserable my wife daughter and i made it on about rides in hours and enjoyed a leisurely afternoon walking around the park you know the tricks of the trade if you ve bee here before do yourself a favor if you haven t been here download the disneyland app for your smartphone that tells you what the wait times are for each ride where the character meet and greets are and had a full map of the park we live closer to disney world now but certainly recommend disneyland to anyone who hasn t been there just remind yourself that it will be busy but it beats being at work ,4,2016-11-12
3475,Love Disney,this was our second time at disneyland we loved every moment of it it really is the happiest place on earth we had a blast it is so magical with all of the characters walking around even in the heat i also loved the halloween theme all over disneyland disneyland i will be back ,5,2016-11-12
3476,Always fun...midweek...,our first day in the park was a weds just before the holidays at dl crowds were minimal and we waited no more than min standby only needing a fastpass for space mountain which is pretty standard the second day was a thursday and the soft open of the holidays at dl it was noticeably thicker in the morning and fastpasses were a must all day by the afternoon and evening it was a madhouse if you didn t have a fastpass in hand you were stuck with limited options or minimum min wait on virtually all rides the christmas parade was its usual awesomeness highly recommended during the fireworks we decided to watch as we walked to small world since there was literally zero room from city hall to the castle jam packed and not so fun cast members direct one way traffic so we jumped on the eac towards small world and beat the post fireworks crowd in line note watching the fireworks away from the main hub is still impressive and enjoyable if it s jame packed skip it also come with snacks and drinks everything costs double what it should and it adds up be prepared to have fun and be exhausted ,4,2016-11-12
3477,Really is the HAPPIEST place on earth,what can one say was here years ago and it s still as enjoyable as it was then was a little disappointed in the parade and the fire works and it s a small world was closed do miss the electric light parade they had back then which was awesome bring it back we will go back for sure cause it brings out the kid in everyone no matter how old or young you are ,5,2016-11-11
3478,again problem with the staff,overall a good experience but jeeze the staff have attitude problems i visit disney florida every two years and i never have a problem always smiling and giving helpful advice i felt this was not the case here and the fact again i got moved several times for the firework shows and electrical parade i had no idea where to stand at all all i kept getting told its too small this one etc etc if this was the very first disney to be built i don t think walt would be very happy his staff are rude ,3,2016-11-08
3479,Dapper Day,we had an amazing time at our first dapper day at disneyland it was great to see so many people dressed up it would be neat to see disney add some more entertainment or events with the dapper day theme and promote it more a lot of people approached us asking about the event and wished they had known about it to participate we love disneyland and will be bringing our kids in july ,5,2016-11-07
3480,Our happy place! Not just for kids!,we visited disneyland park for the first time last month after being regulars at walt disney world for many years above all else to walk in the park where walt actually stood was a fantastic experience there are shared rides between walt disney world and disneyland park but also some different ones you ve got the classics like it s a small world and enchanted tiki room and some more modern exciting additions such as indiana jones and star tours all are great fun though and the theming that goes into each ride and land is fantastic yes it can be busy hot and tiring but it s popular for a reason make sure to plan by looking up a strategy guide online and use the fastpass system as this can greatly improve your experience and utilise your time in the park as efficiently as possible there is also a disneyland resort app which shows you wait times fastpass distribution times parade times character meet and greets and you re also able to book dining reservations my partner and i are and and we had a blast disney isn t just for families and children it appeals to a wide demographic including us adults who love the magic just like anyone else ,5,2016-11-06
3481,Was sooooo busy,hit the busy week i guess rides were mins have not seen that ever also was a very hot week so very limited characters seemed to be outside didn t like that you had to pay for the halloween party on top of spending over usd already to get in won t come this time of year again,4,2016-11-05
3482,Disney Magic,it s unanimous there is no slow time for disney we thought the lines would be shorter in october but so did thousands of others ,4,2016-11-02
3483,Lost a little Magic,california adventure out did disneyland this time disneyland had a surprisingly high number of permanent temporary attractions down at one point the following were all unavailable space mountain ghost galaxy splash mountain it s a small world haunted mansion mark twain riverboat autopia indiana jones understand that this was all at once that doesn t leave many places for people to go lines became overwhelming and knocked disneyland out of the happiest place on earth spot we get that rides stop for safety reasons and disney would rather have them running than not running but it tarnished the experience anyway when so many rides are down they should flood the streets with characters but few were to be found without huge lines ,4,2016-10-31
3484,Still the Happiest Place on Earth,love disneyland the rides and shows are wonderful great moments with mr lincoln should be experienced by everyone as it is truly amazing mass influx of urban assault strollers filled with year old children who will never remember the park really add to the crowded feeling and the hundreds of them parked outside attractions looks like a used car lot big numbers of electric scooters piloted by ex battleship captains adds yo not only the crowds but also impact the safety as the drivers tend to be a bit aggressive and move mph thunder mountain railroad makeover is really good food is dear but a bbq turkey leg is a must and enough for two adults for a bottle of water is borderline legal extortion but there are plenty of water fountains throughout the park ,5,2016-10-30
3485,DIsneyland and California adventure review,disneyland park california adventure review what can i say about disneyland and california adventure park walt disney said that it is the happiest place on earth and i agree seeing the smiles on the children s faces when they get to meet mickey mouse or any other disney character is priceless what else makes the parks so wonderful the rides the delicious food the different themed lands i say that all these and more make it so and in this review i will be sharing with you my personal experiences that validate this claim as well as an overview of the parks the rides hotel s and amenities best and worst times to go to the parks cost my small lists of dislikes and the downtown disney district so put on your mickey mouse hat and get ready for the happiest review on earth the parks and the rides one of the best parts about the disneyland experience is the rides and themed lands there are several different themed lands frontier land cars land tomorrow land and mickey s toon town to name a few and they also have themed rides within the lands which i find to be a nice touch if you want to experience the future then look no further than tomorrow land located in the main park of disneyland as you walk in you may be greeted or see star wars characters as this land is filled with them while they are expanding and building a whole new themed star wars land they also have one of my personal favorite rides hyperspace mountain a thriller rollercoaster ride in which you are in near complete darkness taking tight turns and loops that seem to come out of nowhere when you are tired of being in the future you could go back in the past to frontier land but before you go don t forget to get one of disneyland s world famous turkey legs frontier land is old west style filled with old themed rides like big thunder mountain railroad rollercoaster and another one of my favorites splash mountain foot drop to a briar patch oh be sure to bring a towel as you will get soaked especially if you do what i did and sit in the front want to experience being in a race car located across the street from disneyland is california adventure and in it is cars land based on the cars movies it is a ride that has state of the art animatronics as you will think that the cars are alive because of the way they interact with you the ride takes you into the middle of a conflict in which you must escape how do you escape you ask you race of course and it makes for an exhilarating ending have kids with you they got that covered too mickeys toon town located in disneyland is for all the little kiddies with rides such as the go gadget coaster for the little adventures to be or roger rabbits car toon spin in which you are in a car that you have control over the level of dizziness you want to achieve did i mention that mickey and minnie mouse live there that s right you can go through each of their houses and at the end you will take pictures with them getting board of the disneyland experience head over to the downtown disney district downtown disney located directly outside of the two parks it is a fun relaxing place to catch a movie watch your favorite sports team or even have a drink filled with various diners from fine dining to casual dining a giant lego store and the world of disney store for all your disney shopping needs my family and i enjoyed eating at the only rainforest caf located within miles of washington state where we currently reside with live music and a booming night life you will defiantly forget that you are anywhere near disneyland and did i mention that it is completely free even if you don t have park tickets so where do you stay what are the hotel options hotels and amenities i personally like staying at the good neighbor hotels located directly across the street from the two parks as they are well kept hotels with great amenities most will offer pools indoor and outdoor free breakfasts hot tubs and saunas although you may have to pay for parking at the hotel per day of your stay my hotel anaheim camelot inn cost a day that can add up fast if you can afford it you could stay at the expensive disneyland resort hotels they come with the same amenities as above while adding special ones like disney themed rooms special entrances into both parks and even a wake up call from your favorite disney characters you may be asking yourself how much does all this fun cost what are your dislikes of the parks well it isn t cheap and although i do have a few dislikes i assure you it is worth every penny of it cost and cons disneyland parks cost between dollars per person and that doesn t include a hopper pass which lets you go to both parks as many times as you would like in a day for that it will cost you an extra and they have options for passes as well starting from a single day pass up to day passes for the cheaper tickets it is best to go during january to mid april as that is the slow season from late april to december the tickets will be at its highest price due to it being the busy season this is the cost of the tickets alone that doesn t include the hotel costs which vary anywhere from a day to for the resort hotels that in my mind is a major con another con would be the long lines that you must wait in often easily exceeding hour of wait time but disneyland did help elevate this with a fast pass you can get a free pass for most rides that will have a certain time to be back and that pass puts you in a faster line the rides do break from time to time though maintenance is usually fast to get them back up and running and they will give you a special pass to any ride of your choosing if you are stuck on one that goes down this happened to me and my family conclusion so now that you have a full overview and review of the parks the good the bad the rides cost and family friendly atmosphere i urge you to make your next vacation a disney vacation you and your family will love every minute of it and will not be disappointed in any way and like walt disney said it truly is the happiest place on earth ,5,2016-10-28
3486,Needs help!,i just got finished using a annual pass last yea things seem to be hoping at disneyland as the year has gone by i have gotten more and more disappointed the last visit that was in october was quite disappointing splash mountain and that whole area was closed down most the rides in disneyland had glitches and were closed on and off the place seems a bit dirty not kept up well and the crowds are totally out of control they have brought out a really old parade and the fireworks were quite disappointing i m not renewing my pass over at california adventure they will be closing tower of terror the parade there hasn t changed at all toy story ride seems dirty like they need to clean the sidewalks and umbrellas hopefully things will get better in the next few years,2,2016-10-27
3487,Tired,we had a good day at disneyland but felt the place needs a make over most of the rides are the same from when i was there years ago the fast pass tickets where good if you managed to get hold of them the park closed early for halloween party and we were left out in the cold at the end of the day we were left tired just like disneyland ,3,2016-10-25
3488,Hot October,normally i would shout with joy about disneyland but this last trip was often miserable we started our trip with the extra ticket halloween party it was fun to wear costumes we stood in one line to see mickey after minutes we tried another line but all the characters were on break and it would be an hour before returning so no more characters for us trick or treating went well we came away with full bags of candy but the lines in toon town took minutes to get through the parade and fireworks were great i was sad to discover after booking our trip in july that by october there would be no nightly fireworks or night parade no paint the night very upsetting let alone weeks before that critter country including splash mtn and pooh would be closed the rest of our trip was in degree heat while many tracking sites indicated the crowds would be at level with minute waits we often found minute waits standing in the hot sun was miserable disney had little undercover area for lines or parade waiting we were miserable yes we took breaks back to the hotel for naps but the parks closed early or pm making it difficult to get much done after sunset when cooler i had no problems with staff orcleanliness or even prices my problem is the overcrowding too hot sucked the fun right out of our vacation ,3,2016-10-23
3489,Not sure Australians line up for an hour!,ok so everyone wants to go to disneyland but the reality is i m pretty sure australians are not built to line up for up to an hour for a ride my son and i went to the rio olympics and then flew home via la so we stayed at the hotel the food at the restaurant inside the hotel was amazing our problems started when we stayed at the hotel and we were not properly informed of the times of the magic hour how long it went for when it started and which park had it that day that was very disappointing and when i asked if the concierge could point out where on the website she couldn t it s also not clear that a hotel booking doesn t come with passes to the parks the taxi from down town la the disneyland was over us as i mentioned above many of the rides you have to wait mins for in line and in the hot sun three other rides where mins a few others were to mins and one was well over mins so in summary not a good experience maybe going some other time of the year and being more prepared with the information above you can have a better time or perhaps not go ,3,2016-10-23
3490,It's Not Magic Kingdom,disneyland needs to get magic bands magic kingdom in disney world is so much better because of magic bands it is very difficult to get fast passes and when the park is crowded the lines are very long unfortunately the walkways are tight and when there are crowds it is difficult to navigate here ,4,2016-10-20
3491,"Not exactly ""magical""",maybe it was because i was by myself or because i was in town for work but disneyland was just meh it s not even in the same galaxy as disney world the people at the gates were borderline rude i bought a park hopper pass and when going from california adventure to disneyland the attendant yelled at me for not getting my hand stamped while leaving the other park how do i know you were there she asked after showing photographic evidence from my phone that i was she let me in i didn t mind the crowd or the lines but the whole atmosphere was nothing like wdw wdw is about the total package never have i seen litter there and every interaction with a cast member was pleasant at disneyland the signs even refer to the people as crew members which i think really changes their mindset it just wasn t the same apart from the difference between wdw and disneyland the rides were fun even those the are the same rides have some fun differences i enjoyed my time but i wouldn t travel here just to visit disneyland ,3,2016-10-19
3492,Vacations,it was great but i had some problems like the fact that they don t give you any information until you buy the tickets especially about the special events and then when you find out your only going to be able to spend a couple of hours there because they going to close early for that special event and the tickets price was the the same full price ,2,2016-10-19
3493,Great place pack your patience,don t forget to pack your patience disneyland is fun rides are fun and the staff is exceptional what you realize about disneyland is that people are rude lots of strollers and hyper stimulated kids being yelled at by stressed out parents just go with the flow you won t see it all in one day so enjoy what you can everything is super expensive and beware if days the park closes early ,3,2016-10-18
3494,Annual visit,i come to disneyland because it s a tradition i can t say that i m overall enthralled with a park i tend to view disneyland as a siphon mechanism for the pocketbook with hundreds if not thousands of screaming children and ill mannered parents pushing and shoving through lines disneyland today is nothing near what it was over years ago when i was a kid i like the original disney characters and not necessarily the addition of all of the movie acquisition themes star wars indy jones etc a ticket is now at least each food will cost you dearly and if you carefully observe the people who work there very few of them really smile anymore getting through the lines and crowds is at times overwhelming and stressful on the weekend and it s not uncommon to wait over an hour for a ride so during a hour day you may actually get to ride eight or nine right if they are popular that being said it s still disney the kids love it so it is the point of termination at least once a year don t get me wrong the rides are still fun space mountain and the matterhorn are still as fun as they were when i was a kid i guess i miss the classic disneyland it s worth a visit at least once in your life ,3,2016-10-18
3495,Everything I ever dreamed of and MORE,i fulfilled a year lifelong ambition and was not disappointed in the slightest my wife now has a real lever over me to get me to do things no more disney and that is from australia i cannot wait to go back i was slightly sceptical that i could fill days but could have easily again allow plenty of time to soak up the atmosphere of the original and still the best,5,2016-10-18
3496,Happiest place ...,at least before the large crowds morph into ginormous crowds at some stage around mid morning so much fun ,5,2016-10-17
3497,best advice ever get the disneyland app for your phone,by having the disneyland app we were able to tell where the characters would be and what time and also times of parades events it also told you the wait times of each ride so very helpful it made r trip with little kids much easier also the fast passes made it fesiable to get on the big rides with hardly any wait at all its a must another gr advice was to get your fast pass tickets for the cars ride first thing in the am they sell out quickly for the day and even the line for the fast pass tickets are very long we were going on that ride no matter what but it took thinking ahead many people complain about the cost of disney and it certain adds up but the value on what u get is incrediable if you were to buy tickets to just one of the shows like frozen it would cost a arm and a leg where i live the seats we had would of been about a piece i will not ever be the one to complain about the high price of disney love love it the one thing i was surprised at is the restaurants get huge lines around dinner time so with little kids they get hungray and don t want to wait it worked better to eat early and snack later if needed we watched the world of color light show its a must see get fast tickets early and wait for the show two of us left and walked to the giradeli store and brought back yummy hard ice cream cones and sundaes and ate while waiting for the show they block entry off but they will let u out and back in if u talk to them people were eyeing r ice cream for sure ,5,2016-10-16
3498,Love Disneyland but they are slacking some,went with older children fifth time going each time doing the three day pass disney is amazing and who doesn t love it most of the time the crowds were too much at times so we would leave i would never wait two hours for any ride used fast passes and got there at opening each day so we could squeeze in as much as possible before it got crazy issues some younger staff were not very friendly encountered a few this time which is very rare as most are wonderful what s the deal with an early morning and only tomorrowland opens early plus they squeeze you in the park and you stand there for another minutes like sardines before you can leave main street probably didn t help that the guy i was stuck beside had the worst body odour ever open until midnight packed and restaurants fast food pizza and other places close by pm seriously why it was bad enough trying to avoid getting hit by strollers but now they rent scooters for adults and they are everywhere great for those with an injury or older people but they appear to be over used by some who don t need them some of these things take away the magic of disney thankfully we could leave and go across to california land make sure to get a park hopper so you re not stuck in one park all day ,5,2016-10-16
3499,Way to busy! Don't go in October,disneyland is my favorite vacation but it s way to busy in october a friend i was with during this trip said it was busier than their summer visit lots of rides closed down for temporary repair when had waited in line for hrs very frustrating ,2,2016-10-15
3500,Disneyland,get there make sure you get an early access pass so as you can get on an hour early it really helps if you are interested in doing all the good rides go straight to tomorrowland and do the star wars ride and then work around all the big rides as quick as possible make use of the fast passes as much as possible later in the day as the queues for some rides such as pirates of the caribbean and indiana jones get very long but try and get them all done at least once early in the morning when queues are small if you can get your kids their when they are small do it it truly is a magical place for little ones and i feel bad for not getting my late teenage kids there earlier ,5,2016-10-13
3501,"Overpriced, but still a must-do",i came here as a child in and and my wife and i decided to bring our year old niece on a trip from minnesota to disneyland since we could only be here one day we purchased single day passes which were about for adults and for her parking is an additional in the massive ramp from where you are shuttled to the main gate after standing in line nearly minutes just to purchase tickets we were finally in the park we picked up a map and planned our route first stopping at space mountain the line there allegedly was minutes long but we waited about minutes to get on the ride there is a handy app you can get on your smartphone that lists wait times for many of the rides so you can plan your attack accordingly we found that the wait times for the major rides all underestimated by at least minutes food is very expensive as it is at all tourist traps hot dogs are around a la carte soft drinks are about communication from employees is poor rides would go offline with numerous people in line and nothing would be announced people would be standing in line to take a picture with a character and the character would leave without patrons being told if they would return at all disneyland is an amusement park on steroids and they know they ve got you right in their claws do it once for your kids then just go to the local amusement park in your state each of the next three or four summers for the same price you are paying for this one trip to disney ,3,2016-10-13
3502,First time for 30th birthday,you re probably going to visit both disneyland and california adventure and you should disneyland is much more crowded than california adventure and has narrower streets so moving through the crowd can be difficult they also rope off the center of the park for the parade it can be pretty hectic and wait times can be long so plan ahead my husband and i went to both parks for my th birthday i think disneyland has more for smaller children than california adventure both parks are fun and offer something for all ages here are tips before going to the park similar to my review on california adventure you should allow yourself days to see everything in this park you have to go through security before you can get to the park gates be ready for lines and to open your bags strollers and walk through a metal detector i would skip the finding nemo submarine ride the line moves very slowly and wasn t that interesting also if you are frightened in small spaces definitely skip it s tight and you are shoulder to shoulder in the submarine dining reservations are available days in advance the blue bayou was delicious and really fun it s inside pirates of the caribbean so the vibe is really interesting look at which attractions will be closed while you plan on visiting the park plan which attractions are a must see for you and your group focus on going to those first do those attractions have fast passes grab a pass and move onto one that doesn t offer a fast pass if you can visit the week or two after labor day the park wasn t too crowded before lunch time but really picked up in the afternoon take advantage of the photographers around the park you can download all of the pictures at the end of your vacation for we had days worth of pictures you can pay for day or for all days this works for both california adventure and disneyland if you don t want to download the pictures ask the photographer to take one with your cell phone they were always happy to do so you can bring snacks into the park i saw a mom with a tupperware with at least pb j s inside if you stay on the resort make sure to check the schedule for the extra magic hour we didn t need the extra hour in september but it s good to know which park is opening early download the disneyland app on your phone you get all of the park information hours maps of the parks and character locations and you can see the pictures from the photographers how to use fast passes i was really confused on this before i got to the park you take your park entry ticket to a kiosk at rides that offer fast passes place your park ticket into the kiosk and out pops a ticket with a time when you can return you ll get an hour time frame of when you can return example fast pass for to you can go back to the ride any time between and you don t need to be there at when you get there you go into a separate line for fast pass return and hand your ticket to the employee enjoy a shorter wait time for your attraction you don t need to pay extra for these passes it s part of your park entry ticket ,5,2016-10-12
3503,Family holiday,overrated and overpriced not recommended for teenagers more for kids under the age kids were bored after a few hours and pretty much just wanted to spend time at hotel or in the pools fast pass is a good idea but didnt like getting a fast pass like pm and get told you need to come back in four hours to go on a ride ,3,2016-10-06
3504,Truly the happiest place on Earth!,this was the fifth visit to disneyland within the past three years and it is still the best and happiest place on earth no matter when i visit i get completely immersed in the sights sounds tastes and sensations that permeate the entire park when visiting please prepare to let yourself go and be a kid again to get the most value out of the price of admission plan on staying as long as you can and enjoy the park at a leisurely pace be sure to use the fastpass system as much as possible for the large attractions such as space mountain pirates of the caribbean and haunted mansion and visit the smaller attractions in between wait times can be longer when the park is full so be prepared to wait in my experience the wait and anticipation make the rides even more enjoyable there are rides and shows for everyone s taste along with the attractions be sure to enjoy the beautiful scenery and landscaping that adds so much to the whole experience there are a couple places where i enjoy a relaxing respite to the fun activities the first is the enchanted tiki room where the birds still serenade you with nostalgic and comical songs from days gone by enjoy the show outside before going into the dark and cool theater that will soon be filled with songs and smiles second enjoy a relaxing ride on the train around the park the train visits several stations and has surprise panoramas that entertain young and old alike every ride and attraction tells a story so immerse yourself in each experience be sure to dress comfortably and bring your mickey mouse ears this is a place where you don t need to worry about wearing a donald duck cap or pluto ears dress up and show off your disney flair dining can be as simple as a corndog and burgers to more complex tastes and textures found at the various sit down restaurants yes it can be expensive but the food is fresh flavorful and prepared at disneyland instead of from some international chain restaurant i recommend the french market restaurant or the plaza inn for substantial and delicious meals at the end of the day be sure to enjoy a parade a show or the fireworks before calling it a night finally i think disneyland offers amazing holiday experiences the halloween or christmas spirit is everywhere and brings back fond memories of both seasons i would recommend going during these holidays to really enjoy these special times of the year enjoy yourself be a kid again and experience the happiest place on earth ,5,2016-10-06
3505,Dreams do come true,we visited because our year old granddaughter is fascinated by the disney princesses there are three major places to meet and greet the various princesses hollywood land next to the hyperion for a meet and greet with elsa and anna the royal room in sleeping beauty s castle for a meet and greet with three of the princesses cinderella snow white and rapunzel on the day of our visit ariel s grotto for meet and greet with ariel and several other princesses during a sit down breadfast all the princesses were very nice to my grand daughter and signed her autograph book and posed for photos none of them gave the impression of being rushed my grand daughter s dream of interacting with the disney princesses really came true ,5,2016-10-04
3506,Walking Where Walt Walked,as an east coast resident who considers walt disney world my disney home i eagerly anticipated a trip to california which which would allow me to spend three days in disney california adventure and disneyland park as a disney fanatic and history buff i was thoroughly immersed in the stories and history of the developments of disneyland in the early s i know most of the back stories of all the attractions shows and restaurants even the ones that are no longer present still to walk through the entrance gates and see the train station and flower mickey for the first time was very special turning the corner onto main street and looking down the street toward sleeping beauty castle i was instantly transported to the mental pictures of walt disney and his team bringing his vision of a theme park to reality the jungle cruise was my first stop and i had a great skipper who made the attraction a fun trip familiar with the story i still enjoyed the corny jokes and sight gags pirates of the caribbean was next and once again it was a great experience i closed out that side of the park with the haunted mansion all made up with the holiday theme and jack skellington present in each of these three attractions i was very familiar with their origins and development i have been on the wdw version of each of these and count them my favorites there however i must say the experience of these three at disneyland park was unique special and different not better not worse just different in the good kind of way the highlight of my day was the various interactions with many cast members who went about their roles with the spirit of walt disney very present young or old attraction host or custodial team every single encounter i had and i spoke with dozens of cast members because that s how i roll through action and or language displayed what makes disneyland unique among theme parks in general and the disney properties specifically this was walt s playground his crowning achievement in a very distinguished career somehow just being in the place where walt spent the last years of his life made all the difference in the world i can t wait to go back ,5,2016-10-03
3507,Always magical!,we bought day pass and did disneyland twice and disney adventure land once we had been once before so sort of knew how to make the most of our trip now that my child is a bit older we could get on some of the bestest rides i think we did space mountain times at least this time and star wars at least times fire works were canceled one night due to the rain but we didn t get the outside castle viewing spot this time if you re going for the fireworks show i still think outside the castle is the best place to see them this year being the th diamond anniversary the parades and shows were that little bit more special telling the story of walt disney and his vision for disneyland i want to go to all the lands and worlds in the world ,5,2016-10-01
3508,Halloween Party 2016,we only had one day to visit the park while on business so we chose to purchase the disney halloween party special event ticket we were able to get into the park at pm three hours before the park close to daily guests we enjoyed riding the rides during that time but skip the long lines thinking that they would be shorter after pm don t be fooled into thinking that just because they close the park to everyone else except special ticketed event guests that the lines get shorter and the crowds get much less that just wasn t our experience it seemed like the lines stayed as long as i did before the party started and in fact it seemed that the park got even busier having said that we still love the halloween party we loved seeing all the costumes the halloween candy lines moved quickly and they were very generous with the candy our bag was full in no time we loved the healthy alternatives they gave the firework show is not to be missed make sure you can see the castle we were on the left hand side of the castle and wished we were more in the middle or to the right for a better view the cadaver dan s were great their harmonies were wonderful we had a great time we felt like we were there for almost a full day for less than the cost of a one day ticket despite the fact that i don t believe they limit the tickets much for party and that it was still crowded i would definitely recommend doing the halloween party ,5,2016-09-29
3509,Off Season is the way to go,we just got home from our first trip to disneyland and i had heard all the horror stories of lines and people they do have those but we covered the whole park in a day we had a day park hopper pass and did disney the first day california adventure the second day by the third day we did half a day in disney and half a day at california adventure and we just repeated the rides we enjoyed the most get the fast pass for the busier rides and then go do one or two others in the areas your fast pass ride is in you can wipe out the park in a day that way we did every ride there besides the kiddie type rides and we even did a few of those matterhorn is fun hyperspace mountain indiana jones pirates of the caribean and splash mountain were our favorites disneyland seems very compact but one thing i can say is they can move those lines they have the best crowd control and as someone is getting off the ride your getting on it flows nicely we did not take kids thankfully because a lot of people with little kids and strollers were not having as much fun kids get bored standing in line we had the disneyland app which gives you a layout of the park and wait times some of the times would say min wait and we waited no more than min so use it as a guide since the times are a bit inaccurate you can take in water and some food in a backpack which we did they easily can go on all the rides glad we went and if we did it again it would definitely be in the off season again ,4,2016-09-24
3510,Nurturing our inner child... ;),been here many times over the years and disney never disappoints they re ada super friendly as well ,5,2016-09-22
3511,Happeist place on earth,what can you say about disneyland that everybody doesn t know already this has to be one place that both children and adults feel great and have so much fun the best way to get the max of out of our holiday here was to have a plan of action for the first days know what you want to and see and press plan the day that way you cover of all you need with out missing out on our th and last day we use this to read visit the best rides again and do our shopping for gifts in one hit ,5,2016-09-22
3512,Disney,great resort for all ages cant never love disney quite expensive but very good day out drinks are expensive as you would expect for drinks but you can reuse your bottles and fill them with water at the fountains on hot days,5,2016-09-21
3513,Walt's Original Park,went to disneyland for the st time in my life it was just sensory overload in a good way i was in the park for less than minutes and i saw characters you can t find in the florida parks walking around the cast members were all excellent during the days i was there i spent hours on main street just taking in all the details including the light above the firehouse to honor walt everything is more compact then at walt disney world but i liked that saved wear and tear on my feet there are a ton of things there you can t find in florida like toontown the matterhorn storybookland and the nemo submarines just to name a few every the attractions the two have in common are completely different experiences if you go between the week after labor day until the beginning of january you can catch the nightmare before christmas overlay in the haunted mansion called haunted mansion holiday it s the perfect halloween and christmas mashup pirates of the caribbean is twice as long as in florida with drops instead of one the castle is smaller than in florida but it is no less spectacular there is a cool walk through attraction inside the castle of scenes from sleeping beauty mickey and the magical map is one of if not the best stage shows i ve ever seen it features mickey going on an adventure while trying to paint a stubborn spot on a map keep in mind this show only runs on the weekends didn t think much of the soundsational parade but that s because i couldn t see it very well the soundtrack was pretty good the fireworks were a tad disappointing they feel like they end just as soon as they start all in all i love disneyland and can t wait to go back tips try to go through the week it ll be way less crowded and the lines are manageable all the ap holders flood in on the weekends and wait times skyrocket also you must get a corn dog on main street they are heaven on a stick i recommend full days minimum i spent days and still missed out on a few things,5,2016-09-21
3514,I love me so Mickey Mouse!,this truly is the happiest place on earth i love disneyland it is always clean it is fun to go around christmas i love all the decorations and the parades ,5,2016-09-21
3515,Ok if you are a kid,for kids is ok but for adults is just a nightmare you spend of your time driving and parking and you spend of your time maybe more waiting in lines and only the rest is for playing with exchibits and the rides even less than actually since you also need time to eat the average in general food options which by the way are the most expensive on earth ,3,2016-09-19
3516,"Love, Love, Love",i am a true disney fanatic and disneyland doesn t disappoint the magic kingdom in disney world does have similar rides and areas but the two parks are very different even the same rides are not exact copies except the little mermaid which is in dca so both are definitely worth a visit or several this place was originally designed for families to play together thank you so much walt disney so you will be able to enjoy with your kids from newborns to teenagers as well as your adult friends most rides are dark rides or calm rides that take you through various scenes of famous stories the thrill rides have calmer thrills than most other parks which i m learning to appreciate i love that the height requirements are low so my kids could ride them at much younger ages there are lots of great options for food our favorite is the pot roast and fried chicken at plaza inn it s a quick service location so be prepared to wait to get in and to carry your tray once inside this is not an easy feat especially when you have four young kids by yourself the cast members are incredible so don t be afraid to ask we also love the blue bayou the theming is amazing overlooking the pirates of the caribbean and the food is wonderful shocking since they have the theming to fall back on thank you make sure you get reservations only the very very lucky and very small parties walk in to the restaurant there are also tons of amazing snack options so you may want to research before you go otherwise you will be overwhelmed or completely stuffed before you try them all disneyland california adventure is a short walk across the courtyard so you definitely want to consider a park hopper you could happily spend a few days in disneyland but dca has some really neat options too in short too late disneyland is a must do at least once if you are anything like us it will be become a regular trip have fun ,5,2016-09-19
3517,The kid in you will always rember these days,we where very happy to spend days at the park with our grand children age months and and half plus our daughter and here husband we went on sept till and we thought all school kids would be in school not so they where at disneyland the line ups where not that bad but many rides where down all of frontier land indiana jones haunted house and many more why no discount some rides have no fast pass not so impressed with that the one hour early entry really is not worth it as the lines up will take you at least minutes as they do not have enough security lines open remember your here for the kids and the kid in you please stay off your cell phones and look where you are going be polite to everyone and you will have a super time ,4,2016-09-17
3518,Its always fun!,we spent days and have been to disneyland before our kids are and and when i told them we were going they were so excited it is a place to go just to have lots of family fun regardless of age ,5,2016-09-14
3519,Great for all ages!!,anyone in any age will love coming here it is just so magical and fun can get a bit hectic with so many people but it is worth it in the end ,5,2016-09-13
3520,A place to go when you're over being an adult :),disneyland is my go to place for when i just want to get away from being an adult i can never get bored of disneyland i go every year and have to say that christmas season in disneyland is my favorite while the wait time is crazy long its definitely worth experiencing if you re looking for less lines then you should go when school starts going in september made wait times less than an hour i recommend getting the three day hopper one day at disneyland one day at california adventures and the third day to go back and forth shop re ride all the rides etc overall definitely a place to visit at least one or twice in your life some people aren t as crazy over disneyland as i am but still to experience it just once is worth a many good memories ,5,2016-09-13
3521,Very busy,if you have been to florida then this is a come down notably smaller in all ways and more cramped than wdw many of the rides weren t working on day visited so couldn t ride indiana jones or haunted mansion or the matterhorn bobsleds as either didn t work all day or led to very long queues the scales of the park made me claustrophobic and it seemed far too many visitors were in anyway enjoyed the day but wouldn t revisit wdw every time,3,2016-09-13
3522,Great time and more manageable than DisneyWorld,i was really excited to go to disneyworld with my kids as this was our annual vacation however i was disappointed that two of the rides had to be shut down due to mechanical issues and i did not have the opportunity to ride them going to disneyland with young children and expecting to go on a ride when your fastpass comes and the ride has to be shut down and you have to make plans to go back down doesn t happen and becomes a big disappointment for said parent i was happy that they had spaghetti at one of the restaurants in tomorrowland so my son could eat i was really disappointed that they served milk as my son only drinks chocolate milk was an option but i m not wild about giving my son all that sugar all day long ,4,2016-09-12
3523,Excellent - everything you expect from Disney,we had been to disney in orlando more times than i recall and loved it but this is a step above there just seems so much more to do in the one park rather than having to jump between parks we love it say no more ,5,2016-09-12
3524,If your child is 10 years old - they are an adult according to Disney,we have children of different ages yet still children if your child is years old or over they pay as an adult which i found to be wholly unfair and a blatant money grabbing stunt because of this we spent one day in an over crowded over priced disney will not return over for a bottle of water seriously ,3,2016-09-02
3525,Disney disaster,we visited disneyland today for the first time my childhood dreams were shattered it should cater for kids and adults if you ask my opinion is does neither people are blinded that because it s disney it s disney sorry it s not disney rainbows and butterflies you can tell that they haven t spent any real money on bringing this park up to date i honestly felt that i went back into a time warp yeah i get they want to keep the nostalgia but not by not updating the park disney you need to reinvest all the money you are taking off the hard working members of the public and put some back into the park perhaps invest some of the capital from all your films into bringing this park up to date and giving the people something brand new and not continuously touching up the woodwork from the you can clearly see that your staff in the park don t share the disney magic either guessing like the park you don t invest in them either conclusion is the board need to serious review where your capital is being spent look after the park and the staff and honestly share the magic instead of milking the magic for yourselves ,1,2016-09-02
3526,It's Disneyland. It's the happiest place on Earth.,i love disney but time is money do your homework use the fast pass system get the wait time apps make your character dining reservations as early as you possibly can or run the risk of missing out i m not kidding stop at city hall and get all of the commemorative buttons that you like they re awesome keepsakes and the pressed pennies are fun too eat churros corn on the cob popcorn and dole whip see the fireworks and watch fantasmic take the time to look for the hidden mouse ears everywhere and use the photo pass they do really fun magical touches stop in a moment breathe it in realize that you will be overwhemed at points but take advantage of every moment because the most unexpected things become your favorite memories ,5,2016-08-28
3527,It is Disneyland. Expensive and crowded,the park is clean of course rides are fun but there were long waits for just about everything i m talking minutes in february and fast pass system is worthless you have to be at ride location to get one then come back to ride you spend whole day crisscrossing park to fully utilize better plan a tiered process let people do this online in advance of visit that way people who are trying to really see the park can plan their day and not be frustrated then fast pass for day of visitors for anything that s left then for locals who are just going because they live close and can go whenever i would pay extra to plan in advance ,3,2016-08-28
3528,"Never again, let down for the price",visiting during the summer is not wise seriously overcrowded with rude people and disney just packs you in the result is long lines for rides and if one ride is down or two of rides as was our case indiana jones and the train then the lines are even longer i would visit during the slow periods in the fall and call ahead to make sure the rides are working the poor quality of maintenance of the rides leading to high down time and no disney discount when rides are not working makes me no longer interested in visiting thanks disney for the memories maybe open a new park and place limits on attendance ,1,2016-08-28
3529,Not worth the money !,we spent the summer at both parks but for some reason majority of rides and shows were being repaired cancelled or closed this was ridiculous no fireworks running back and forth for no reason won t return ,1,2016-08-28
3530,Lifetime Dream,i couldn t believe i was standing in disneyland yay we went in the summer holidays by accident so we were expecting chaos it was busy but it was so well organised so much to see even when you are waiting in lines the fast lane options were unexpected but so pleased they were there use them we had a ball year olds running around the park it was fantastic everyone we came across was super friendly staff and other guests magical during the day and just as magical at night ,5,2016-08-27
3531,Great family park,things have not changed too much from years ago still fast pass as much as you can they are starting to really push star wars now and it has improved the space mountain ride and star tours is different several shows so go on star tours more than once more star wars to be built everything else is still good if not great this park is built more for families with little ones which is ok parade and fireworks are great at the end but they really need to get the layout to watch more organized just awful trying to find a spot a full day to see with small ones at least remember that peter pan is not worth the minute wait so go early with the kids early morning entry pass the sub ride too the bobsled mountain coaster is very tame from how scary it looks disappointing almost the thunder railroad coaster is better still a fun time ,4,2016-08-24
3532,Love Disneyland,what can i say it s disney happiest place on earth i will say that i did the aladdin oasis paint the night lunch package the food was good and it was nice not having to get there hrs before to get a spot we loved watching the fireworks from the location as they do a show on the it s a small world ride ,5,2016-08-23
3533,MAGICAL....are there any other words needed?,great place to take the family for a couple of days i recommend spacing it out and not sweating what you don t get to we would spend the morning there and then go back to the hotel for naps before the night shows best advice is take it easy enjoy the shows as much as you enjoy the rides ,5,2016-08-19
3534,Great if have never been or if you are a kid.,disneyland is great for the younger members of the family and a great experience if you have not been before like everything in the us it s all big can be overcrowded especially on weekends so can be difficult to move around which is frustrating and waiting hours to do one ride you can fast track but this is at certain times and even these are snapped up quickly ,5,2016-08-16
3535,Didn't want to leave,the park is super clean the employees are really nice and they manage the visitors amazingly well my family had the time of their lives their words and can t wait to come back it was a very hot day and they were thoughtful to give as much shade and a c as possible i was a skeptic who wondered why people were so obsessed with disney parks but now i understand i look forward to our next trip hopefully in the fall ,5,2016-08-16
3536,"Relax, 'let it go', accept the crowds...and enjoy.",the crowds and the heat can make things challenging but the magic of this place after multiple visits over the last years has not diminished some things that made our visit a pleasure arrive early and go for the fast passes to the popular rides as soon as possible line up for other popular rides while holding that fast pass for another ride lines go quickly early in the day and then leave for a while head out for food somewhere else find a pool or take a short nap back at the hotel the heat of the day made us and the thousands kids surrounding us more irritable in the early afternoon return in the cooler part of the day for some more rides and the wonderful parades for us disneyland is tons of fun if we accept that it is going to be crowded choose our path and plan of action take our breaks and go with the flow ,5,2016-08-14
3537,Birthday Trip for my 3 Girls,my every yr vist and st visit for my girls on their birthdays so much fun day pass st day from open to close in d land hrs and breakfast with characters nd day in d land hrs rd day in ca theme park hrs thank goodness i researched and educated myself about the fast pass did it all town hall for their bday st visit buttons from there everyone acknowledged them the entire time making them feel special not once did my yr old twins or yr old complain they including my hub my mom and i loved it and all kept up with no hesitation ,5,2016-08-14
3538,"""Disneyland Park""",its our second time at disney park the kids love it and us too expensive there but worth it before you enjoy there don t forget to plan which attractions you want to do in order not lose your time download the disney app waiting time for each attraction see your location use the fastpass and see night parade fireworks ,4,2016-08-13
3539,Such a let down and none magical,so what can i say about the magical place on earth terrible for the money spent on getting in you would think that things would of gone smoothly when coming to the park it wasn t to bad but finding half the rides being closed because they were having problems and the staff being rude the entire place is just a shopping area with hardly any rides and with the money you spend to come in i do think that it s a waste of money when it came to the night parade the staff were very rude and would snap at you if you stood in the wrong step and would shout if you tried to stand anywhere josh who was outside the penny arcade area really made my time at the park a bad one and i would return again when trying to enter one of the shops a staff member shouted and said i couldn t enter the fireworks display was cancelled and a poor light show was given that lasted minutes i ve found that this is not the happiest place on earth more like the dullest and rudest place on earth that just wants your money,1,2016-08-12
3540,Not A Diamond Celebration...,this was the nd time i visited within months on a week day and both times they canceled the fireworks due to winds really it was so blazing hot not a puff of wind to be had its disney packing people beyond the limits at for a day pass serving crappy expensive food and not coming through at the end of the day this was not a diamond celebration but rather a cubic zirconium celebration ,2,2016-08-11
3541,Truly a magical day (thanks Ridemax!),we had one day to spend at disneyland and it exceeded our expectations we heeded the advice of previous posts and forums and arrived early and were in line at the gates at a m when it came time for rope drop we were off and running and hit peter pan first luckily we were at the front of the line and waited two minutes but when we exited the ride it was already up to minutes we hit every major attraction and had time for a big break in the middle of the afternoon which gave us the ability to come back and enjoy more of the park late into the night we never felt rushed or tired and the longest line we waited in all day was minutes i m seriously crediting this to ridemax and will say it was the best we spent on vacation we followed the plan it created to the minute and it worked perfectly i m still amazed at all we were able to do while avoiding long lines our favorite rides were hyperspace mountain start tours indiana jones splash mountain and big thunder mountain we did many more i loved the jungle cruise and haunted mansion my personal favorite as you can t beat the disney classics due to having so much free time we enjoyed walking around and just taking in all of the disneyland magic our son had the time of his life doing the jedi training but the key to that is to make sure you sign your child up right away in the morning as they spots fill up fast the parade was really cool but unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled due to the winds getting there right at opening and utilitzing the fast pass system is the key to a happy relaxing day versus a long hot frustrating day sitting in long lines this was our first visit to disneyland but we loved it and we ll back again ,5,2016-08-10
3542,"Love Disneyland, but NOT in the summer!",i love disneyland always have and always will but i will never ever ever go in the summer again the place is great and i love the historical aspect but the infrastructure is old and just cannot handle summer time crowds it was just awful the lines for everything are horrific no place to sit even and shade is very few and far between we have witnessed that huge families will go and they ll pay park admission but won t spend any money in the park and just clog all the rides and bathrooms i get it it s a lot of money even for a small family and big families have a even harder time but for example please don t bring in your lunch and take up tables in the shade away from families who are actually buying food here this is one of many of my complaints but needless to say i learned my lesson one last note maybe if the crowds weren t so bad maybe the cast members would be nicer i don t know but compared to disney world the cast members seem to just hate their jobs a simple question is a huge inconvenience to them and you get an eye roll and attitude not all the time some employees are great but i d say percent of the time they just hate you makes me sad ,4,2016-08-10
3543,Alot of miserable people,disney claims to be the happiest place on earth but i saw alot of miserable people complaining about their feet hurting and just aching to sit down while waiting in the long lines i waited over two hours for a few of the rides and i along with most of the people were in agony because they did not have one bench to sit down on to give your feet a rest on any of the rides why can t disney put some benches in each of the lines ,4,2016-08-08
3544,Not Disney world,i am a fan of everything disney i have been to wdw in florida a dozen times in my life and disney cruises i can t give it less than a because it is still awesome but the cast members were almost rude you don t get this at other disney run places i think it must just be california i got that feeling a lot when i was there we still had a great time go at park opening and utilize your fast passes wisely,4,2016-08-08
3545,Fun for the most part,disneyland is always fun but it s gotten so big and it s absolutely packed with people lots of pushy foreigners who don t speak english probably won t go back for a really long time ,3,2016-08-08
3546,Where is the magic??,my family and i were so excited to revisit disneyland i have always felt it was more quaint magical and less commercialized than disney world however on this trip the staff seemed grumpy and frankly over it the ticket window lady was super annoyed with our transaction several rides were down for refurbishment which we knew ahead of time fast passes are lacking and the wait times begin to become too long we love disneyland but felt the original idea and concept is becoming lost ,3,2016-08-05
3547,Painful,too many people and disney s application which is supposed to display the current waiting time for each attraction is useless because disney doesn t provide wifi its wifi partner at t must be upset the staff doesn t even care about this contradiction ,2,2016-08-05
3548,Customer Care is not there.,from the start of out visit at disneyland we could see that customer care was not there the security was rude to check our bags and we then rented a wheelchair and they couldn t have been any nastier they did not give us full details about the usage of the wheelchair and then we got yelled at because we didn t have a certain piece of paper to go through downtown disney with the wheelchair so we had to walk all the way over to get the piece of paper to use the wheelchair in downtown disney the next security person didn t even ask for it what a waste of time the park was crowded but we got to ride most of the rides that were working it was sad though about of the rides were down and the monorail was working because it was too hot outside as we were told this park is nothing like the disney world and the quality of customer care you get there ,3,2016-08-04
3549,Smaller but still enjoyable if you plan a little and use your fast passes,we are huge wdw fans however despite disneyland being smaller we found we liked both parks here as well just differently after getting a jedi training slot for the little one go early ie and nlt we were able to ride most rides in tomorrowland she wanted to ride astro blaster autotopia hyper space mountain and nemo subs without too much of a wait no more than mins before returning for her jedi training show time at while my husband was waiting riding with our yr old i popped over to adventure land to grab fast passes to the other rides she wanted to get to thunder mountain splash mountain and indiana jones all these were doable with very little wait no more than mins using our fast passes the only down side we saw to disneyland is that it seems a lot less organized in comparrison to wdw esp for the evening parades fireworks sadly both days we had here the fireworks didnt work ,4,2016-08-04
3550,Disney Line (not a typo),i took my family myself wife and two adult daughter to disneyland for two days in late july it was hot but that is expected there was not much shade especially at california adventure and there were lines for everything we had to stand in a security line even though we had no bags to check we stood in a ticket line shortest one all day we stood in line for drinks food rides and to see the light shows and parades sore feet and sore backs all around on the plus side it was very clean all the food was excellent the staff was very pleasant and the rides were great was it fun yes was it very expensive yes we stayed in the disney s grand californian hotel spa for one night had one dinner in park and one in downtown disney plus four two days passes it cost just under for the two days did we enjoy ourselves yes but not as much as our day boogie boarding day on the beach i suggest you try the beach first save your feet and save your money ,4,2016-08-03
3551,What can I say? It's magical,no one can come close to doing an amusement park like disney just walking into the park gets me all giddy and i m the smells the atmosphere the workers or excuse me they are called cast members which is perfect because they really are putting on a show a show of friendliness and pure joy the characters the rides it s all just classic and fun yes it s busy at pretty much any time of the year there are some exceptions but then at those times many rides are closing for maintenance and yes it is outrageously expensive and you just about have to take out a second mortgage to get your family there but if you can swing it do it and go you won t regret the memories youll have forever ,5,2016-07-31
3552,Childhood Favorite,i have been going to disneyland ever since i was a child and now that i am an adult i still try to go every year or every other year i have nothing but good memories of disneyland and california adventure i have been to disney world in orlando and although the sheer size of all the parks is amazing and something that i definitely recommend for any disney lover there is something special about the closeness of disneyland over disney world not to mention it s the original everyone should visit disneyland at least once in their life ,5,2016-07-30
3553,How To Do It All,to get on all the major rides in one hour day arrive there as close to am as possible when you enter go to tommorowland and check the wait time on space tours and space mountain take a fast pass these are free on the one with the longest wait time and wait on line for the shorter line attraction the fast pass will give you a return time window that you can return and eliminate most of the wait time meanwhile check out another land s wait time for a high end attraction and get on line by the time you wait through that line it will generally be time to go back and use your fast pass just repeat the process in another land getting a fp for the longer wait line before you know it you will have gotten on all the rides with the least amount of effort good luck ,5,2016-07-30
3554,Overpriced and greedy company,save your money it s way too much money and way too crowded there are so many other wonderful places in orange county do your research on what kind of a company you are supporting also they need to stop being greedy and help out the community ,1,2016-07-26
3555,Very bad experience😏😞😞😞,it was the worest disney we went at florida and paris it was amazing but here in anaheim it was very small a very small number of games very very crowded and too much time for each one maybe one hour and much more if you insist to go just ask for fast pass ,1,2016-07-25
3556,Fantastic!,they aren t wrong when they say its the happiest place on earth all the staff from those running the rides to those on cleaning duties were all so helpful informative and willing to help customer service in disneyland is superior and as australian s travelling there staff went out of there way to make our trip special by giving us a few special treats like a complimentary fast pass to a ride where it had sold out which was a great thing can t go to calafornia and not visit disneyland highly recommended ,5,2016-07-25
3557,Still crazy after all these years!,first off this is disneyland and not disneyworld this can be good if you are looking for the standard experience which we were we have been to both and disneyland is just easier and more laid back it doesn t offer all of the amenities of world but it s still disney we went on a rare july day and it was only degrees and luckily a monday so crowds were at a minimum best part is the fastpass make sure you read up we help fast passes at one time because all you do is wait for the start time on one and then you can pick up another we were there at park open a must do and rode all do the big rides well before lunch we rested from and went back for a lovely evening be careful with the parades and fireworks many rides shut down and you can t get from one side of the park to another so make sure you are where you want to be for the duration that s about it read the blogs they really help with your experience oh we are a couple with our year old so this review is for teens that can hang with the adults and go when it s time to go ,5,2016-07-23
3558,Fed up by ignorance of Disney Photopass service,it s about a month since our visit overall everything was ok we have good memories but we made a lot of photopass photos now at home there is no way to access them i have mastercards they worked fine on site here at home in eastern europe disney photopass does not accept them error message there was a problem adding your payment method just keeps coming disney photopass is not giving me any options i am really fed up i tried to pay for photos on site but cast member told me to do it online so here i am in couple of days photos expire i am not returning to anaheim ,1,2016-07-21
3559,Meh,if you are going to go to disneyland wait until you are in your s by this age you have learned that patience is a virtue or rent out the entire park to yourself anyway let s start at the beginning we walk up to a lady behind a bullet proof window with a hole shaped like mickey mouses head we tell her that my son is turning today so she tells us we have to pay full price for him i tried to be nice and even funny but no dice this woman has worked here since the day disney opened and she likely gave birth to walt disney himself she s seen it all and she doesn t care so i bought tickets went to a different counter changed my story and got my son in for free i had warned my kids of the lineups and i made sure i took snacks and water and anything that i could possibly hold on my back i downloaded the app to tell me wait times attractions etc it didn t help we went on about rides and waited in line to meet mickey rapunzel and goofy and then we stopped for lunch at that point my six year old made an executive decision to go back to the hotel and play in the pool so we cut our losses and left later that night we went back but still it wasn t for us we are personally homebodies so if you are like us and don t want to hang out with people i d say skip disneyland go to the disney store and call it a day ,1,2016-07-18
3560,Who doesn't like it here,great fun as always very busy but still good good fun for all ages it is very clean there the only thing that would make it better was to have some express lanes if you have no bags to be checked it seemed to bottle neck there made so we didn t want to leave and have to do it again ,5,2016-07-16
3561,"...it has changed, but it's Disneyland...",when we lived in ca i used to go at least or times a year i had not been in quite some time and it has changed my granddaughters had not been since they were or so we thought it would be great we arrived early on the shuttle from the hotel which was nice first stop was breakfast in frontierland wad not crowded at all spent a couple of hours on all the rides in frontierland and pirates haunted mansion it was downhill after that the crowds arrived went on a few more rides after navigating through the crowds the lines were long and the wait times tooo long therr is just too many people now too many strollers and no one seems to be smiling anymore grand kids wanted to leave at about am sorry to say my memories have been shot the competitor done the road is better ,3,2016-07-16
3562,"Crowded, hot, long wait times....",this is our second time visiting the park we expected crowds which were definitely present wait times for everything were over minutes so use those fast passes as much as possible when visiting tomorrowland go past the matterhorn and take the first right to enter tomorrowland because there is a huge traffic bottleneck at the main tomorrowland entrance between star tours and astroblasters there are always a lot of strollers and scooters parked in this area and a lot of people trying to move through on the walkways going around the matterhorn to the back side avoids all this traffic it also seems like every time we visit the indiana jones ride is already broken or it breaks when we re in line as was the case this time food was over priced everywhere for a cheeseburger at the galactic grill we did have a decent chicken dinner meal at the cafe on the corner by tomorrowland that seemed more reasonably priced ,3,2016-07-16
3563,Magic sort of lost,it had been about years since we last visited disneyland as a family when our children were small so coming back was a treat for us the park itself was ok as we did not necessarily had to wait too long for rides however we did not really feel the magic the park employees were not really out there greeting and being super friendly or happy something we ve always noticed in the past it just seemed like another theme park nothing spectacular it is disappointing given the cost to enter the park not sure we will be back anytime soon maybe in years ,3,2016-07-15
3564,Disneyland--a timeless classic,we hadn t been to disneyland since the great thing about disneyland that although they keep up with times to some extent it never seems to be at the expense of the old favorites stepping through the gates onto main st usa brings back all sorts of nostalgic feelings even though the small town usa depicted was never part of my personal experience for those familiar with disneyworld in florida disneyland seems quaint and tiny the whole park consists of just the magic kingdom and you don t need a day stay to enjoy it all even when you throw in the california adventure park but it is most definitely worth a visit if for no other reason than this you can walk where walt disney walked walt died in and never made to his planned theme park in florida which did not open until disneyland was his vision his dream come to life and you can feel his presence especially in town square and main street so if your travels are taking you to southern california plan a couple of days to take in the disney parks in anaheim you will not regret it ,5,2016-07-14
3565,Happiest Place on Earth,it is the happiest place on earth i wish it were a little more affordable prices sure have gone up hard to take a family on a budget military discount offered to my son was amazing though i appreciate disney s support of our military families favorite ride hard to choose but indiana jones is definitely up there ,5,2016-07-11
3566,fantastic day,i got there early in the morning and had a list of places and rides that i want to go on spent day in both parks ,5,2016-07-08
3567,Amazing Place will definitely go again,the fireworks in the end along with the sound and light show really blew our minds never have i seen such an amazing and spectacular show the whole of disneyland is really a dream land i would love to visit again and again ,5,2016-07-07
3568,Family Vacation,best family vacation ever disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth we drove in from vegas for our yr olds first visit couple of things we learned the hard way is the monorail takes you into tomorrow land so our first day lost the wow factor of main street the boy only wanted to stay in tomorrow land day we entered the right way and the magic was there we also learned the hard way that you don t get the extra hour staying at disney resorts everyday to disneyland only california adventure disneyland only opens early tues thurs and sat i assume people plan ahead and know food is expensive and not the best the best food we found was the places on main street the best tip i can recommend is get there at opening you will be able to walk on most rides that first hours once if not more times we are planning our next visit already ,5,2016-07-06
3569,Disney Does it Right,i am sure that everybody already knows disneyland but it was a ton of fun we enjoyed it for sure there are plenty of recommendations about how to get the most out of your trip obviously use the fastpass as much as possible as you would expect it was quite crowded but that should not be a surprise there are plenty of spots to relax if you need or just step out and walk downtown disney ,5,2016-07-06
3570,Another great trip,i visited disneyland for days one with my year old son adult stepson and my mother in law one day with both my stepsons my son my daughter in law and grandson each day was equally enjoyable we utilized the fastpass system quite a bit and were able to ride all the rides we wanted by pm the first day and that was including time for a table service lunch at caf orleans thursday was busier but we still got on all of the rides we wanted i always love disneyland and never have a bad time there though it is quite a challenge to exit the parks during the evening right before the fireworks start since the former second entrance to adventureland from fantasyland is now closed off due to star wars land construction just be aware that it will take a lot of time to get from fantasyland to the exit if you can stay until after the fireworks and let the crowds disperse you will be much better off ,5,2016-07-06
3571,Happiest Place on Earth,my sister surprised me with an annual pass vyears ago i get to visit from las vegas frequently and we take her youngest kids with us yr old niece and yrs old twins nephews we cannot get enough of disneyland and disney california we re kind of obsessed with it we all love star wars too so all the new sw additions are amazing tips for newbies don t park hop in one day it takes too long getting through the lines and crowds if you don t time it just right we spend our time one park at a time get fast passes immediately i usually take a twin with me while my sis niece and the other twin waits in line at another attraction maximize time people as soon as you re eligible to get another fp get one this helps cut down time waiting in line do the rides in that land instead of running back and forth between tomorrowland and critter country where the lands are at opposite ends of the park use the train like a subway to get from one major area to another my husband says it s his favorite ride but i don t agree it s a great way to get from one area to another eat breakfast before you get there bring snacks and water bottles with you save food and beverage purchases for the special places my favorite is the mexican place by thunder mountain railroad the clam chowder by pirates of the caribbean is awesome and you must try the burgers in tomorrowland if you re a ride lover like my sister and i skip the shows and parades and do rides in the adjacent areas as lines are shorter you might be able to do haunted mansion and pirates a few times when fantasmic is playing sooooo much fun if you re new to the park study the map and layout ahead of time go to bathrooms on way to other rides take lots of photos as souvenirs shop at close by walmart and target for small souvenirs near the park if you re on a budget don t waste time waiting in line with characters unless you re in a big group and someone is shopping or on a potty break you can snap their pictures while in line get there early and stay late the rides are busiest p p so morning and later at night are not as bad for lines enjoy ,5,2016-06-30
3572,Great experience,great place to visit and definitely more than one day needed due to crowds an exciting and fantastic experience however lots of patience required whilst waiting in queues for rides highly recommend at least one visit ,5,2016-06-30
3573,"Manageable park, but give yourself two days",we went in the height of summer and found the park really crowded the wait time for rides was a bit of a hindrance to getting to see everything allow yourself two days and unlike california adventure park they have no alcohol on property ,3,2016-06-30
3574,Loved the Disney Magic!,we loved disneyland we got to do the paint the night dinner at blue bayou the service was great and the food was really good we then got tickets for our reserved seating more like standing and made our way down to main street to stand in line for our reserved seating once there we were told by a cast member carrie that we could not stand in line early and if we did then we will be told to get in the back of the line yes i know what you re thinking she was not having a magical day lol a lot of people did not appreciate her threat and tone and asked to see a manager drama my family and i had a wonderful time regardless thank you to casey starnes from dlr prep school for providing us with great tips we were able to have an amazing time in disneyland we couldn t have done it without her blog ,5,2016-06-29
3575,Where dreams come true✨,growing up i ve always wanted to go to disneyland the overall experience was yes magical the park was clean staff were helpful rides were enchanting we spent two days here and definitely needed it the fireworks display and colour the night parade in the evening were beyond my imagination if you can stay and watch the fireworks do it i would recommend this park to everyone and anyone it s fun and i didn t think the gift and food stores were too overpriced i thought it would be worse overall a wonderful and memorable experience and one day i hope to bring my kids back to enjoy the happiest place on earth ,5,2016-06-29
3576,"Love, love, love Disneyland",no matter how crowded no matter the weather i love disneyland getting there when the park opens provides plenty of opportunity to ride many of the big rides the paint the night parade is fabulous as is the th anniversary firework show we had breakfast with minnie and friends at the plaza inn and our girls granddaughter her step sister had a ball it s spendy but worth it they met so many characters great fun always i ve started going to disneyland when it first opened and my grandma took me had occasional visits throughout my youth and now as a mature ha adult go every year i love it ,5,2016-06-29
3577,Not nearly as good as Disney World,the disneyland personnel are by far inferior to the disney world personnel the park is smaller and many of the attractions were shut down due to them building newer attractions that was very disappointing especially when you spend dollars just to enter the park i thought we just had a unlucky visit at the park until the next day when we went to california adventure and experienced other rides that were broken down over dollars and of the major attractions were shut down very very disappointing ,2,2016-06-29
3578,Doable in 3 days,the place is small enough that you can do theme parks one each in day and able to ride and experience some shows the rd day would be to just relax and go over once again to those attractions that you want to there are several attractions that were closed though but it s okay the only one that s new i think was the star wars attraction my kids love the submarine nemo ride of course wear good walking shoes and comfortable clothes bring water if you can because the prices are triple i didn t like that you have to pay for the photo pass feature everyday when you download the disneyland app since you re barely looking at the pictures taken that day if you want to buy a particular picture then it ll cost you more use the fast pass a lot and it ll help you budget your time bring sunscreen even though the weather was when we went ,5,2016-06-27
3579,It truly is the happiest place on earth. The only time you see a child cry is from total exhaustion.,june is not the month to attend but we didn t have a choice because we visited for our granddaughter s th birthday november is my favorite month to visit not too cold not too hot and the christmas vibe is just commencing ,5,2016-06-25
3580,It's Disneyland !!!,myself my wife and two kids had a brilliant time it was completely magical and yes of course there is a lot of people there more than my children had ever seen but it was still fabulous we got to go on everything we wanted saw everything and did everything but we were pretty well planned top tips get there early like right when the gates open whilst everyone else is struggling through their buffet breakfasts you can be riding the rides no matter how early you are there there will still be people before you second top tip use the fastpass system if you don t know what that is then research it will save you hours of queuing you ll get to feel like a vip as you walk pass everyone else and if you have got younger kids it s a must a five year old active boy queuing for mins for a ride forget about it okay so it is a bit expensive but just look at them as disney dollars not real dollars and get over it how often are most people going to go a few rides do seem a bit lame but others are just awesome pick the ones you want and plan your route the park is actually amazingly well organised with lots of places to take a breather and soak it all in plenty of toilets and usually clean and well stocked food and drink outlets everywhere though not a huge amount of healthy snack options though you can find expensive fruit carts overall it was one of the highlights of our holiday and i am sure my family will never forget it thanks walt for having that vision all those years ago ,5,2016-06-23
3581,Fun time,went to disneyland with my family or we went on a tuesday the wait times are very reasonable we were able to see everything that we needed to see most lines for minutes or less a few of the larger rides were closer to minutes the fast pass was fantastic we loved everything about disney ,5,2016-06-17
3582,Disneyland - the original and best,as a regular visitor to walt disney world in florida disneyland feels strange yet familiar magic kingdom in wdw is not a carbon copy of disneyland and for me disneyland wins by staying at the grand californian we were able to take advantage of the early entry to the park and it really does make a difference by doing so we were able to get on three attractions space mountain buzz lightyear s astro blasters and finding nemo submarine voyage before the park officially opened as the gates opened to the general public eventually it became an average late spring day for crowds some lines getting over an hour but we were still ahead of the crowds and got on several more attractions matterhorn bobsleds pirates of the caribbean haunted mansion and big thunder mountain before heading back around lunchtime for a break upon our return we used our fastpasses for indiana jones adventure got onto it s a small world and took in the fantastic paint the night parade to end the day i say that disneyland wins over magic kingdom because several of the rides at mk seem to be a lite version of their disneyland counterparts pirates of the caribbean for example is much longer at disneyland and features two drops instead of one even the more modern rides like buzz lightear s astro blaster space ranger spin at mk work better as you have guns that you can hold and aim instead of the swivel guns at mk space mountain at mk probably shades it for me but it is effectively the matterhorn bobsleds with a different theme where mk wins hands down would be tomorrowland which at disneyland is looking very run down as a result of a failed refurbishment to give it a steampunk theme several years back to match disneyland paris and it s removal long ago of the peoplemover of which the track still remains it was a little disappointing that part of the park was closed due to the construction of star wars land and i think cast members aren t as cordial as their east coast counterparts but the overall disneyland experience is an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable day or days out ,5,2016-06-16
3583,What a Disappointment! Parades saved the day!,this place may be good if you have young children granted we visited on a busy sunday afternoon and evening however the park should be built with crowds in mind we only visited the disneyland park not the adjoining park thank goodness for that for adults i think it is a big disappointment if you are trying to follow your childhood dreams the place looks dated and old it was surprisingly small in area the crowds were crammed in you had to queue for everything and i mean everything food rides and toilets meant a queue the fast pass system was great until staff say that they are not issuing fast passes for whatever ride anymore we managed to use two rides or attractions during our hour stay temple of doom and haunted mansion the food was terrible couldn t even find a hotdog in the usa again more and more queuing i have never seen so many children crying and upset in one place the best aspects of the park were the character staff they did an excellent job store staff were not as enthusiastic so many young people in the park were doing a great job the saving grace of the experience was the day and night parades they were brilliant and again character staff saved the day the fireworks were excellent as well at times being obviously watched by security staff was off putting i would not recommend this park for adults go to the other parks in la we had an issue with ticketing that was very well handled by staff can t fault them on that it may be worth just going for the parades but don t get your hopes up for the other attractions if it is a busy time ,2,2016-06-15
3584,First visit!,after going to wdw a good amount of times we decided to finally make the trip out to wall s orginal plan for the th celebration we were advised on how small it was compared to wdw but being there it didn t feel too small the indiana jones ride was awesome basically the dinosaur ride in ak paint the night parade was amazing and had me feeling like a child again i freaked out seeing the evil queen out there were at keast villians out in the park while we were there my experience was absolutely dazzling and i can t wait to go back ,5,2016-06-13
3585,Daugther birthday/Christmas trip,we try to go to disneyland at least once a year if not more we returned for christmas and don t plan to go back the park is overpriced no longer decorated how it was before restrooms are dirty ,2,2016-06-12
3586,Awessome,can t wait to go again will definitely go again next year fast pass is great long lines but not ridiculous probably due to time of year we went,5,2016-06-05
3587,Fun,love the park as everyone knows it s expensive i recommend going during off season less people shorter lines ,5,2016-06-03
3588,Not Disabled friendly unless you are in a wheel chair.,i found that the park is not helpful for people that are physically disabled but still walk not in a wheel chair i am an amputee and i am not able to stand for long periods of time but i can pretty much walk anywhere disneyland did not accommodate me or my year old mother because i wasn t in a wheel chair if i stand in a line for an hour i will not be able to walk very far after having to stand in one spot don t get me wrong they do a wonderful job accommodating people who use a wheel chairs but they need to look at things a little different and also give a different kind of pass for people with disabilities people should only have to explain the disability one time i brought my year old grandson and my year old mother and i felt bad that i had to tell my grandson that we couldn t go on a ride because i couldn t stand that long ,4,2016-06-01
3589,Fun park but too crowded,stayed at a disneyland hotel was supposed to get to enjoy an extra morning magic hour day park didnt let people in until due to equipment issues day very crowded day california adventure half the rides didn t open until well after even though magic hour opened at ,2,2016-06-01
3590,A bit of a met fown,the rides were too slow bit very exciting the queues for food were ridiculous an excessive amount of retail stores the parade didn t start till about pm the fireworks were about pm waaaaay too late enjoyed universal more ,3,2016-05-30
3591,Happiest place on Earth.,no place iid rather be than the original if i lived closer i d be there nearly every day if you haven t been to disneyland you must go it s worth every penny i could write a book on the place so i will stop there ,5,2016-05-28
3592,should rename to disney wait,people said it was a very uncrouded day the middle of the week before memorial weekend but the park was packed with long wait for everything this includes all the rides including the simple ones also dining optiond are pretty crappy go to orlando instead ,3,2016-05-26
3593,More Crowded Than New Years Eve,we ve been long time premium pass holders spending of our last new years extra trips every year at the happiest place on earth decided to combine a last minute trip to disneyland with a business trip before our passes expire as we may not renew them due to the price increase we went in were shocked to discover the crowds due to all the ride show attraction closures in preparation for star wars land it was even more crowded than new years eve i still love disneyland but we are probably going to forgoe our annual family new years tradition and wait until star wars land opens for the next trip i feel sad for any first time visitor because this is not the happy place i so dearly love see photos that were taken at ish saturday from the bridge in front of the pirates of the caribbean which is also out of commission as a walk way ,2,2016-05-25
3594,My Happy place,it is a good family destination however a bit costly they will allow you to bring in you own food and have lockers to store your items until you are ready for them my suggestion is to go early in the morning and then take a break and go to your hotel for lunch and a brief rest before going back for the afternoon and evening events ,5,2016-05-25
3595,Honest review of Disneyland,firstly i love disney love it i ve been to euro disney and disney world florida and have been planning this trip over a year our transport got us there around am i decided to book a tuesday as figured it would be less busy than a weekend it was packed the queues to get in to the park were an accurate reflection on what was expected inside we could barely move between the sea of people i appreciate there would be a lot of strollers bit seriously people use them as weapons to get through every ride was almost an hour wait and we only had hours in the park got a pass for the indiana jones ride which was great until it broke down midway and we had to be rescued after they tried for minutes to fix it before getting us out went to splash mountain and that was also broken down disneyland itself is beautify the castle is smaller but still impressive and the shops are gorgeous and attention to detail amazing my boyfriend and i are very fast normally in parks but with a pass hopper we only got on rides all day it s a struggle to do in day most of the day is spent trying to get through the crowds in lines or stuck on roller coasters we were also stuck on california screamin which was closed once we got off ,3,2016-05-25
3596,Brought a friend for her first visit,my plus friend from australia had no desire to go to a kiddie park i told her trust me she had hurt her knee so we navigated the park with a wheel chair she was so impressed with the gardens and details that only disney can do we listened to the coke corner pianist and the dapper dan s we watched the disneyland band performance we did old people stuff like the tiki room yes it s old school but so much fun the golden horseshoe skit saw my friend picked from the audience she was thoroughly enchanted and it was fun to see disney through her eyes staff was brilliant with the wheelchair as well ,5,2016-05-24
3597,Not the happiest first Disney trip,this was our first trip to disneyland i have to say i was a little disappointment on how small the park is the castle compared to disney world castle the kids had fun on some of the rides but long lines lot of people made it hard to enough our time there what i don t like is that you have to wait hour in line to see a disney or super hero character not what i remember growing up from disney world when the characters would be walking around the park taking pictures with you signing auto graphs now you have to wait in long lines if you don t get there early enough you miss the characters the frozen characters the one s the kids really want to see you have to get there when the park first opens to get a ticket if not then you miss your chances the long lines missing characters price on things made the day not as special as i would ve hoped i can t believe too how expensive one day ticket is i was lucky my dad gets a discount w his company ,3,2016-05-23
3598,No good time to visit...you'll have to decide if it's worth the aggravation.,there is probably no time to visit this place and avoid the massively long lines except for tiny windows here and there ex week after thanksgiving however i thought that since most of the schools in the us and canada were still in session that may would have been a good time to visit i was wrong may is for graduates high school college and middle school we were overrun by the cap and gown crowds being bused in from all over california there were also choirs academic achievers etc in fact one group actually took over the indiana jones attraction and it was off limits to the general public i don t think that is fair especially to people who come from thousands of miles and pay tons of money thinking they will get to see at least the most popular attractions by booking all these large groups for may i am sure disney makes a profit but at what cost to the rest of us long lines hours plus for hyperspace mountain combined with reduced hours ensure that if you are lucky you might make it to rides that is if you have a big bladder and don t need to eat drink or rest that means that each minute ride is costing you about is it worth it my kid loves disneyland and seeing her delighted face is certainly worthwhile but this place has become way too expensive for a lot less you could go to the santa cruz boardwalk buy the kids an all day unlimited rides wrist brand and you could sit on the beach and tan while they play sounds so much better than standing in endless lines for everything at disneyland from rides to food to bathrooms those are chunks of your life you are never getting back plus you ll be walking always walking the gloriously underwhelming th anniversary has shut down the train the monorail boats etc to me the whole th anniversary thing was over hyped and poorly executed bottom line unless you are a huge disney fanatic or have kids that insist on disneyland save yourself a lot of time hassle and expense if this is your once in a lifetime trip to california why not explore some of the other terrific places this state has to offer take the scenic route up the coast and visit some of the fantastic beaches take surfing lessons go to yosemite ride a cable car in san francisco lay on pismo beach and knock back a few beers you will be less tired and less poor doing this than you will after visiting disneyland california adventure ,3,2016-05-23
3599,Star tours,my favorite ride by far definitely use a fastpass for it or get there first thing in the morning the rest of the park had a few good rides but this was my favorite ,4,2016-05-22
3600,Awesome holiday,we were flabbergasted by everything the colour characters shopping layout cleanliness etc there is a lot to do and you will be kept busy throughout your day,5,2016-05-21
3601,One Day Not Enough,great experience for kids and adults lots to do and lots of shopping or food available too for increased riding by adults try the single rider option on indiana jones and the matterhorn best food deal was the mangos and grapes sold at stand in frontier land or on main street the fruit was really fresh and sweet ,5,2016-05-20
3602,Disney for adults,we love taking an adults disney trip every few years here are a few tips and our favorite things to do if you re going as adults and in a small group get to the park at opening yes there will be families there at the same time but in my experience they head toward fantasyland or stop for breakfast etc hit the busiest rides first before they get too crowded space mountain big thunder mountain railroad indiana jones etc utilize single rider passes many rides offer these you ll still get to hang out together during the line and you most likely will not sit together but it is a good way to ride the popular attractions without wasting hours in line there are times we have ended up seated in the same vehicle we use this option for indiana jones space mountain radiator springs racers california screamin etc get fast passes for the rides you can t do single rider or don t want to separate on splash mountain big thunder mountain tower of terror blue bayou is a fun option for lunch or dinner,5,2016-05-19
3603,Happiest Place on Earth,if you go to disneyland get the day park hopper there is just too much to do in both parks and you really need days to do it all bring extra money for food because the food is amazing and you need to try it learn to use fast passes and be smart about them aside from peter pan you should never have to wait more than minutes if you use your fast passes right it s a great place and time flys by when you re there ,5,2016-05-19
3604,MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BRING........,patience we visited disneyland on it was crowded with many high school senior day kids in fact one of the parking lots was closed just for those busses to park i would recommend not visiting during mid may to late june this is the graduation season and many visitors are in the park upon arrival you will find that parking is for cars and motorcycles unless you have an annual pass that includes parking after parking you will catch a tram to the entrance plaza of disneyland california adventure and will go through a cursory security screening a word of advice selfie sticks are prohibited within the park after passing through security you proceed to the entrance kiosk and enter disneyland upon entering you are on main street usa and gateway to the lands of imagination of walt disney from here in a clockwise direction is adventure land new orleans square critter country frontier land fantasyland mickey s toontown and tomorrow land check the website for attractions that are closed for renovation even being packed people are moved orderly and quickly utilize the fast passes that are available tips be prepared for a lot of walking and standing start early pace yourself and end late exit the park to eat much cheaper bring your own water and snacks use the fastpass for those rides you really want to go on but do not want to wait in a long line if you want to eat at the blue bayou call ahead for reservations stay and watch the parade and fireworks show watch out for strollers they are notorious heel biters most important though enjoy yourself see it though the eyes of a child it is a most magical place ,5,2016-05-18
3605,Happiest place in the world,we weren t sure whether we should go there without our kids or whether we d enjoy it as adults but it was an amazing day an acquaintance on the same trip with us joined us for the day and we were all really impressed and totally enjoyed the day the cost is very reasonable the level of detail put in to every aspect of the park is incredible the rides are worth the wait comprehensively represent the stories they are based on and are enjoyable and educative service is great everywhere after we left we noted that we hadn t seen anyone smoke or drink alcohol at all during the day while there were masses of people there we also didn t see any rudeness pushing in queues arguing or even any unhappy children with so many kids there you would expect some tantrums but it genuinely was like we d walked under some pixie dust at the entry as all we saw was happiness all day despite some long waits for some rides they have signs with wait times and we learnt the wait was less than the signs said also the waits are moving through castles and buildings that are part of the ride and story experience so it mostly isn t like a wait as you take in the building story and artefacts we initially weren t going on the nemo ride as we thought it was for young kids but later the line was short so did and all three of us considered it a highlight the parade and fireworks blew my mind amazing and to think they do it every single night we were staying at the opposite end of la and people told us it would be hard and expensive to get there wrong we got an uber it cost about us when we left a car was there so no wait and the cost was about us money well spent and the trip was less than an hour there are an extensive range of souvenir shops with quality products at decent prices budget for this plan for a big day stay till the end to enjoy the parade and light show the rides get quieter after about buy some mouse ears and wear them with pride amongst the masses i loved mickey s house and you are able to get photos with your own camera or phone taken by disney staff some days are cheaper we went on a monday quiet day cheaper entry enjoy ,5,2016-05-18
3606,Happiest place on earth created from one man's dream,was here for an entire day literally mean the entire day from am to midnight we bought the park hopper so that my group of four can go to both park in a day it is expensive but it is worth going the coaster rides are all interesting and i highly recommend seeing both the firework in disneyland and light show in california adventure park if you are here this year highly recommend to watch the paint the night parade the parade song still stuck in my brain two weeks after my visit the parades were wonderful and magical i especially commend the staff in disneyland park for their dedication and help throughout my visit i lost my ticket and the staff went beyond their duties to ensure that i can still do park hopping to watch the shows in the night disneyland is truly magical and the happiest place on earth one man s dream is very well be this magical ,5,2016-05-18
3607,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.....",the good it s the happiest place on earth or it is usually the bad with star wars going in tomorrowland is closed and there is so much construction going on even in other areas maybe it was the week i was there but so many things were not open or working properly when i went to complain at town hall the guy was really nice but just gave me fast passes with of us having annual passes and of us having just paid for day hoppers they should have done more btw that was fast passes just for one person me which just ain t right ,2,2016-05-17
3608,Magical Greed,i am a socal resident during my last trip to disney i wondered for the first time if greed is overshadowing the magical kingdom and moreover the vision that walt disney had laid forward with increase in price you would expect the value to go up in regards to one s experience but not in disney seems like their objective is to let way too many people in the park that you would be lucky if you could even experience or rides well well no one ever forced me to go there its just that our pop culture has made this entity so powerful that it can just about get away with too many things walt disney may be shedding tears from his magical kingdom up there ,2,2016-05-17
3609,some rude employees,last time i was there i had an employee embarrass me about my purse being on the seat next to me it was buckled up and i thought since it was an awdward bag that this would be the best thing she addressed me rudely in front of everyone it was not a fast ride i would have known better i havent sent in a complaint everyone has their things just kind of ruined the nd half of my day,4,2016-05-16
3610,Everything is broken down,closed pirates mr lincoln safari boat ride and indiana jones went to the town hall to complain had to wait in line they then told me to fill out online paid adults child almost to watch obese americans eat cakes ice cream etc according to my child it was a great day ,2,2016-05-13
3611,Is the Magic disappearing???,we just returned from a family vacation to the magic kingdom and have to admit that some of the magic has disappeared huge disappointment was the fact that almost every ride we went on had some type of malfunction that created delays from to minutes and two completely closed down for the day we have since spoken with others who experienced the same thing one with an evacuation from the top of california screamin we also experienced extremely long lines when entering the park from the downtown disney side what made it more frustrating was that there were no line control barriers until almost at the gate so there was lots of jostling for position and crowding the entrance off harbour blvd however seemed to handle the crowds better the parades at both california and disneyland side and character breakfast at goofy s kitchen managed to convince us that there was still some magic left at disneyland but after more than years of going to the park it s gone from being the happiest place on earth to a themed amusement park perhaps disney management needs to re evaluate their service delivery to minimize ride disruptions and offer better crowd control on those especially busy days like mother s day and the marathon runs ,3,2016-05-13
3612,Love Disney But Things Have Slipped,our family loves all things disney we have visited anaheim a few times and as much as i hate to say it it s not what it used to be i still love the park the detail the rides but i think they have probably done too good a job of selling the california resident passes because on a so called quiet week the place was very very busy the first time we visited years ago we got ourselves a map and systematically ticked off every ride and every show in two days we had done the lot now after days we d not even achieved half of that the magical hour is nothing like what it was we spent half of it queuing to get in i can t believe on their th anniversary they are issuing tickets and taking security photos at the turnstile unbelievable you used to do all the ticketing aspect at the ticket booth and the turnstile was a quick entrance into the park there were rides closed for maintenance the monorail the disney train matterhorn and steamboat which we were forewarned about on the app but then several rides kept closing due to power issues those being pirates of the carribean haunted house space mountain this meant a lot of people looking for something else to do putting pressure on the other rides that said would we come back probably we would give it a second chance in the hope that things have improved please just be prepared for a lot of long queues make the most of the fast passes which ran out just after lunch enjoy the sights and sounds and smells that only disney has and don t get your hopes up about how much you will achieve in a day ,4,2016-05-07
3613,Fastpasses are a beautiful thing!,disneyland doesn t really need a review because you re gonna go anyway but i just wanted to share some tips fastpasses get them for your favorite rides before they run out for the day you can get a new one every hours and some of the rides don t count towards your time so check your fastpasses for that info if you re not interested in seeing the light parade get to the area you want to be in before it starts because then you ll be trapped and can t get anywhere until there is a break in the parade we got stuck and lost precious riding time we were just getting off of thunder mountain when the fireworks started and it was a great viewing place the worst that happened was space mountain now called hyperspace mountain which is my favorite ride broke down after we waited minutes on line luckily it was back up later on and thanks to our fastpass we waited only minutes per isitpacked com the park was considered to be hey it s alight but it didn t feel that way so i d hate to see it on a day it s considered to be packed all in all it was a great fun day and we can t wait to return ,5,2016-05-04
3614,Small and crowded everyday,not recommended go to universal studios the park is small and crowded no matter when you go i went on a tuesday in low season and it was still crowded you have to make a line even to go to the restrooms way smaller than the ones in orlando the park is made more for locals than tourists when in florida is the other way around don t waste your time ,2,2016-05-03
3615,Crowded,i have visited disneyland many many times in my life and planned this trip specifically because it was listed as a slower season while not as crowded as the summer or holiday season things became quite uncomfortable i went knowing many rides were closed due to construction on the new star wars land but it was disheartening to see how little they ve done to alleviate the bottlenecks this has caused in addition to the rivers of america being closed the jungle cruise the autopia the train the monorail and the matterhorn were closed the prices just keep getting higher while the offerings lower we enjoyed meeting star wars characters at the launch bay but it s hard to see so much space going to waste we watched the path to the jedi show in the old captain eo theater which ended up being merely a montage of scenes from all of the star wars movies i have always loved disneyland but this experience just didn t live up to the price tag i truly hope things change for the better ,4,2016-04-30
3616,Too Crowded and too many rides were broken,disney allows too many people into the park they clearly don t care about making the experience pleasant to the guest they only care about money i don t understand why they allow california residents to pay few dollars for an annual pass and flood the park at the expense if guests that pay full price clearly the california residents do not spend money at the park they bring food and drinks from home and are significantly less profitable to disney than out of state guests yet allowing then to flood the park at the expense of other guests convenience naked no sense in addition given how expensive it is disney should do better job maintaining their equipment nearly one in every rides wad either broken or broke while we were in line overall our experience was not pleasant at all we now refer to disneyland as the most miserable place in the world we are done with disney our vacation dollars will go much further somewhere else where you don t have to spend of your vacation time standing in line with sweaty people or spend minutes in line to purchase a bottle of water for enough is enough ,2,2016-04-28
3617,Too crowded to have fun,we visited the park on april which is supposed to be a moderate weekend for crowds we arrived at am fortunately which allowed us to ride about six rides by am after that it was so crowded we could barely move we held our six year old granddaughter s hand the entire time so she would not get lost or trampled by the crowds many lines past noon had minute waits we planned our day carefully and used the fast pass options which helped but it was less than the happiest place on earth for us we saw a few characters during the day pluto mary poppins and bert where were the rest we logged our walking during the day and walked miles by pm when we were too exhausted to walk any further fortunately our six year old was a trooper and enjoyed her day we couldn t bear the thought of the crowds for the evening events and went back to our hotel to swim in the relaxing pool ,2,2016-04-27
3618,Truly the happiest place on earth,i ve been to the disneyland in tokyo and hong kong before i ve never been to disney world so far my favourite disney theme park is the disneyland park in anaheim it is just right for my young family as it is not too sprawling but also big enough that we can easily spend at least days and up to a week there i have young daughters aged and and there was something for everyone in the family our family s favourites are it s a small world finding nemo indiana jones hyperspace mountain though i still prefer the original space mountain paint the night parade mickey and the magical map the fact that the california adventure park is just a short walk across the gates is also a big bonus ,5,2016-04-26
3619,Too many people!,i love disneyland but my last experience with my twin year old nieces was not good there were way too many people in the park and the lines were too long we paid over and only got on rides during the entire day they need to find a solution to this problem during the busy months ,2,2016-04-26
3620,Family fun at Disneyland,the best rides at disneyland star tours fp hyperspace mountain fp finding nemo it s a small world indiana jones adventure fp pirates of the caribbean haunted house fp peter pan s flight at night at around pm make sure you save a spot along main street to watch the breathtaking light show paint the night and fireworks the music coupled with the show made the whole disney experience magical and memorable just like my other review of disney california my tips are tips make sure you get there early when the park opens use fastpass for popular rides like star tours indiana jones adventures etc ,5,2016-04-20
3621,Fast Passes Are Your Friends!,disneyland is where we can all go to be kids again as long as you can pay for it luckily disney has re introduced the so cal resident passes that you can buy pretty much anywhere in so cal buying a few days worth of park hopper passes is way more affordable now leaving me no choice but to get down to anaheim as much as possible the best way to do disneyland is to use the fast passes hyperspace mountain splash mountain pirates of the caribbean and the cars ride in california adventure are the biggest waits so i would suggest planning your trip around those passes while you are waiting for your time to get on the ride you can wait stand by for other classics around the park make sure to wear comfy shoes as you will be walking and standing pretty much all day finding seating anywhere is very difficult scout out restrooms on a park map before you get there so you don t end up wandering around looking for them trust me that sucks if you can afford it take your kids to the minnie and friends breakfast at the plaza inn it s an all you can eat buffet you dont need reservations in the morning and tons of characters are just walking around table to table greeting everyone and signing autographs california adventure is more of an adult friendly park with an outdoor roller coaster a swinging ferris wheel and of course beer and wine take a walk through cars land at night and it s like you are really in radiator springs i love this place the fireworks at the end of the night are always magical as well but make sure to save your spot early because it gets crowded same goes for any of the parades seriously save up and take some time to have a wonderful family experience at the best theme park on the west coast ,4,2016-04-19
3622,List of tips for taking kids! ....plus review!,ok so everyone loves disneyland so we went with our two kids and instead of boring you with how great was which it was i ll give you the good tips i have strollers a must have get the disney ones yes they are a little small butifyour little one is out of nappies it is much better than dragging your own pram stroller in why because you can get bumped out of the tram lines getting in out of the park i saw this happen a lot to folks with bigger prams eating go to the area around the mickey s house the meals there for the kids are the healthiest in the park not fried has fruit and even the nutritional value is on the cool bag rides if you re a parent duo one of you can ride on splash mountain whilst the other one is slumming it in the winnie the pooh ride parade grab a spot about mins prior to the start of the parade if you want o be close enough for the kiddos to see it doesn t matter where you you want go get there early enjoy disney hope my tips help ,5,2016-04-17
3623,Getting way too busy,i hadn t been to the original disneyland in years and it was the first time i had taken our children there we had been to eurodisney a few years which we was not nearly as crowded my son just wanted to go on the rides but with lines up to minutes it s not a great experience for a year old boy as a foreigner i was surprised how of the people in the park were white ,2,2016-04-16
3624,5 day pass over 14 days,beautiful place overpriced for food and water do yourself a favour and try the pineapple whip worth lining up for my heart went out to the parents that couldn t afford the merchandise so expensive when their children began to cry just a thought disneyland if you can pay your ceo a ridiculous salary google what he is on surely you can reduce a bottle of water to or compared to around us even a stick of cinnamon churro was around us ,4,2016-04-16
3625,Happiest place on earth but my wallet is crying,i am constantly amazed about how expensive this place is besides paying day park fee you are constantly nickel and dimed for everything churro water if you like lead in your water like desani or for quality water for pretzel for soda for ice cream sandwich for an orange really i see orange trees all over the disney parks yet they have the nerve to charge this much for a piece of fruit forget about eating actual good food here you only get overpriced garbage next thing you know they will charge you for breathing disney air another thing that annoyed me is that the staff at the park wouldn t help my husband who recently had a procedure on his back with any sort of disability pass which they claim that they provide they told me that i would have to rent a wheelchair and of course that s more needless to say that he sat out the majority of the rides their lack of care attitude towards my husbands situation merits a one star rating ,2,2016-04-13
3626,Over Rated,great place if you want to be in a crowded place with screaming kids and sweaty adults there were a few rides that were fun for adults be prepared to pay dollars plus for a burger i question the moniker of the happiest place on earth make sure you get fast passes for every possible attraction you can or you ll be standing in line for upwards of an hour on off peak times ,3,2016-04-12
3627,It all started with a Mouse!,i love disneyland and everything disney yes the tickets are expensive but that is a price for up to hours am midnight in a park with unlimited rides and entertainment the more days you add the cheaper the price is per day its a great park the shows are top notch and they take care of the park and it always looks clean and freshly painted that s because it is you have to go in knowing it will be crowded and have lines that is just how it is go to a long line and while part of the family waits to get on the ride send someone to go get fast passes at the next big ride you can get another fast pass after two hours look at your fast pass for times fast passes will run out for some rides be smart and take advantage of the fast pass night time when the little ones go to bed or early entry times your feet hurt well sit down and relax a bit and watch one of the shows or people watch its a small world is a great ride to go on and relax and cool off get your hand stamped and hop over to downtown disney and grab something to eat over there and take a park break or go back to the hotel and cool off in the pool and come back to the park later don t give the park a bad review because you had to stand in line or the park was packed what do you expect just you in the park ,5,2016-04-11
3628,Coming back for a fourth visit from Australia means I must like this place!,despite the crowds screaming kids and waits in line there is something magic about this place the rides are fun for all ages hyperspace mountain indiana jones splash mountain for the big kids it s best to go on rides late at night when people are watching the fireworks and make sure you get a hopper pass for this visit my main focus was getting my five year old to experience disneyland mission accomplished he loved it this was the busiest time we d ever experience disneyland next time i would come back during february and ensure that i don t visit on a weekend to avoid the crowds and wait time ,5,2016-04-11
3629,A Wonderful day,my husband and i spent the day here with my daughter her husband and our year granddaughter my husband and i only did disneyland because the younger folk spent the next day at the adventure park we packed in a lot of fun in one day without too much effort we did use fastpasses several times my granddaughter is quite the adrenaline junky and she loved all the rides she went on the haunted mansion scared her enough that she got a little teary eyed but when it was over she still said it was fun the rides she requested to repeat were the big thunder railroad and the it s a small world we didn t get to see the parade because it was canceled due to the rain a few hints let your little one ride the tea cups early if there is rain threatening we rode it early and noticed that it was one of the only rides that remained closed once it got wet bring extra phone chargers by the time you use the disneyland app and take lots of pix send them to other family members you might have some pretty low battery levels we brought a really good one that can charge phone all the way twice plus we threw in an extra cheaper one so we left with plenty of juice left admittedly my daughter used lots of battery since she had an unavoidable issue with her business buy packable ponchos from home just in case ,5,2016-04-10
3630,Love it but too crowded,love it but too expensive and crowded we have passes and its always crowded now it used to be good on some days not anymore not sure we will renew too expensive for what you get ,3,2016-04-08
3631,Not Always a Happy Place,the long lines at various rides were daunting it was hard to find restrooms and not enough employees inside the park to answer qustions or give directions i was extremely disappointed that the steam train was not running as that was the main reason we went there store merchandise was inadequate we searched in vain for any merchandise featuring favorite charactors like scrooge gyro etc on the positive side they handled the overwhelming crowds very well and with good security spectacular fireworks if you can only visit one theme park in socal go to knott s berry ,4,2016-04-08
3632,Not great - prefer Florida hands down.,visited disneyland in anaheim in march this year was gob smacked at the entry prices i m not sure how the locals can afford to go here it cost us dollars for two people for one day park hoppers for both disneyland and adventure park both parks do not offer the fast pass system that is offered in florida to get a quick queue ticket you have to walk all the way up to the attraction and queue to get a quick queue ticket you then get allocated a time slot for later in the day you then cannot get another quick queue ticket for two hours park is old and needs updating especially in technology there is no wifi at the park there is a wide range of food outlets but again all over priced and not great quality park is very small compared with disney world in florida which is quite nice as you can get from attraction to attraction quickly but also due to it being small there are ride queues everywhere which can making moving around difficult they have some ok rides but they also have some dreadful ones hyperspace mountain being the worse and it had a queues constantly of hours it is just space mountain which the word hyper added was so disappointed would not visit again once is enough ,3,2016-04-07
3633,Happiest Place on Earth,i love disneyland i have been going since i was a little kid and have taken my kids since they were babies it is expensive it can be crowded to me it is still worth every penny i love the park it is better than disneyworld the shows are awesome the fireworks are magical it makes me feel like a kid and creates wonderful memories for my family i know my kids will one day bring their kids too they are teenagers and still love the park and they are all smiles when were are there ,5,2016-04-06
3634,Disneyland,while certainly not the equivalent of disney world the family really enjoyed our first visit to the original theme park disney enthusiast have to make this trip at least once it s a small world and pirates of the caribbean are different than disney world and the dole whip is a great dessert the star wars theme to space mountain was awesome,5,2016-04-06
3635,"Loved fast passes, spring break and never waited more than 25 minutes",with a and year old still a major hit this trip we did not have magic hours but arrived before and didn t miss them hit all the marquis rides by am using fast passes plus a little waiting pirates ended up being our longest wait or cars race cars were worth it now space mountain has a star wars theme don t miss the other star wars attractions nearby always love buzz too and don t miss soaring over california in dca ,5,2016-04-04
3636,Overpriced and Over-crowded.,it cost us nearly nz to go to disneyland for one day the park was insanely crowded we managed three rides as the queues were hours longs aside from the rides the rest of the park is over priced souvenirs and food totally not worth or wasting a day on several attractions were closed but you were allowed to walk on them seriously what is the point of walking on a stationary riverboat or steam train ,1,2016-04-04
3637,Really crowded,the park is good if you like to just walk around and look at the rides but if you want to ride the rides you will have to wait at least minutes the lines are just way to long thanks to the fast pass we got to ride at least one ride finally after about pm you can finally ride something without having to wait minutes other than the wait the park is clean and the rides are pretty average ,2,2016-04-04
3638,Disneyland,first visit to a disneyland with my family our kids aged loved it plenty of rides for them to enjoy we took a three day park hopper pass fast pass was the way to go to get to the popular rides with a long wait time also the disneyland app on smart phones through app store was useful to get real time time update on rides and to find attractions in the park ,4,2016-04-04
3639,Always a fun and enjoyable time with family,preferably pre purchase your ticket entrance once inside it is always crowded so try to plan which attraction are of your interest to get fast pass tickets in advance food is not the best bit expensive and not variety for adults nice experience and with days all attraction were visited ride ,5,2016-04-03
3640,85min wait line,sooo freaking crowded lines are so long min long not going again everything is overpriced too many dead ends and the thunder ride broke down my son did not like the waiting we has to leave ,1,2016-04-01
3641,Disapointed by Magik Kingdom,we visited disney world florida few years ago it was way better the disneyland park is smaller and the castle too the personnel organizing parades didn t do a good job people were walking here and there during the parades same thing for the fireworks a lot of crowd people saving seats spots for the whole family for and hour or more they wouldn t let you use them even if you have issues with your feet anyways no way to deal with those guys and nobody to complain to ,3,2016-03-30
3642,my favorite place in the world!,i have seen disney parks in florida hong kong japan and paris an of course my favorite one anaheim the original plus you have california adventure park next door so its two parks for one visit i stay at the disneyland hotel as i dont care for the other two on site disney hotels holidays like easter th of july fall autumn halloween and christmas new years are very special love it everyyear ,5,2016-03-29
3643,"Wonderful, but overpriced (new prices in 2016) & Fantasmic & other attractions are closed!!!",fabulous place but not a great time to visit and way overpriced especially with new pricing scheme introduced in person years old and older person or person depending on peak regular and low seasons also many of the best rides and shows including fantasmic are closed cancelled as they are building a new star wars attraction they should have lowered the prices due to fewer choices but instead have raised them some things they can work on food options need a major revamp all very fatty sugary and unhealthy at skyrocket prices shading for lines to make it more pleasant on warm hot days better merchandising exclusive to disneyland disney merchandising has been diluted bland better shows fantasmic was their best show but now that it s been cancelled due to new upcoming star wars attraction the paint the night parade is good but not great doesn t have the disney wow factor as fireworks may or may not happen depending on weather conditions they need a backup night show perhaps expand on the lights presentation better maintenance several rides including splash mountain and thunder mountain were down for mechanical problems several times after long waits they are overdoing on the star wars theme it s more star wars land than disneyland have been going to disneyland all my life but very disappointed with disneyland this time around too bad ,4,2016-03-28
3644,Probably the last time I'll waste my money here,expensive recently increased prices again overcrowded to the point of being dangerous if there were an emergency staff that mostly just didn t look like they wanted to get there this was the worst experience of disney i ve had being a regular of disney world in florida i recognise that i ve gotten used to the experience there a comparing the two is just like comparing chalk with cheese despite this i ve been to disneyland several times whilst never overawed this trip just failed miserably the only reason i gave it two stars rather than one was for the quality of the firework display very good just not good enough to convince me to return with the family anytime soon shame on you disney for not caring enough so evident throughout the day ,2,2016-03-28
3645,Terrible Overcrowding,it s official disney is all about the money as a second time season pass holder my family has experienced nothing but overwhelming overcrowding and wait times yes fast pass is useless also i and others that go to the park all say it s unsafe reconsidering bringing grandchildren to park ,2,2016-03-28
3646,can't get enough,our son has multiple disabilities and it was a struggle to get him to california watching my son s happy face when he met mickey was one of the happiest moments in my life his joy was infectious and there wasn t a dry eye in toontown ,5,2016-03-28
3647,Disappointed,beautiful parks and great shopping i love all things disney but my family was disappointed with dl we have been to disney world several times and there is really no comparison disney world wins hands down every time dl is small park entry is a nightmare we went for early entry got to the parking area at for the am opening parking did not open until once we got parked the tram took minutes to pick us up and we were on the first tram then the security lines were a nightmare not enough lines open causing a huge back up then we had to get in lines for the actual park again what a mess slow slow slow it was before we actually got into the park so much for the early entry we had day tickets but only went no need to go back anytime soon disney world is the way to go ,3,2016-03-27
3648,"Brilliant, fun and magic day!",amazing day get their early and plan to stay all day use your park ticket as a fast pass to avoid the longer lines at the more popular rides and you can avoid some pretty massive lines wait for the night time parade it s fantastic a few tips would be if you have a food allergy or special requirement you would be best to bring your own food as it s pretty much all fast food if you want a good spot for the fire works you are going to need to stand somewhere on main street from pretty early on as it fills up fast and they do not let you just stand anywhere to look up at them you have to be in the white ropes which fill up from early on don t bring a selfie stick they don t let you bring them in and take them off you if you do manage to get them past the security check it s a fantastic day brilliant fun ,5,2016-03-27
3649,Disneyland was crazy busy! Long lines and no shade.,our fault for going at a busy time but omg did not see any characters besides in the parade i have waited my whole life to go on space mountain and it did not disappoint it s a small world is a must very magical pirate s was great indiana joins very exciting although my year old was pretty frightened matterhorn fun but not worth a real long wait haunted mansion is one of my faves p s my family preferred california adventure sorry walt while i appreciate disneyland for being the original and a classic it did not live up to the more modern and amazing ca adventure ,4,2016-03-26
3650,Boooooooo!,i just don t get the draw to disneyland my husband and i took our year old for spring break huge mistake i know i wish i could say that it was a magical five days for us but i just can t some parts of it were but there are some huge issues that the disney corporation should really be forced to address first the entry one morning we got there at and we re stuck in lines waiting to get in until we wasted an our just trying to get into the park wr learned our lesson and slept in for the rest of our trip all of the lines were so incredibly long and it could have been solved by simply opening more entry stations it s almost as if they want people to be miserably waiting in line because after you gain entry that s pretty much all you do lines for rides were at least minutes long the majority are much longer second the amount of strollers being pushed through the park is insane i don t know how many times i was tripped and run into it was horrifying it s only compounded by the number of people inside the park it s absolute mayhem the whole experience feels like disney was sucking money and life out of us i can t get the time i wasted standing in line for everything back i feel foolish for allowing it there are so many other ways to spend my time and money instead of on the overpriced tickets crappy food and gift shop junk from china inside the park this really could and should be a magical place for families but it s not it s shameful boooooo disney booooo ,2,2016-03-26
3651,DREAM COME TRUE !!!!!,what can i say im this is the disney i had as a child i ve been to disney world and it is truly wondeful but this was a dream for me first off yes it s smaller the castle is smaller etc but it was wonderful my friend told me to go to mr lincoln and look for a bench he wouldn t tell me more it was the bench walt sat on dreaming about building made me cry so much history so much to see and do it was very crowded due to spring break but we still got to do most of items on check list pirates is so much better there loved it hope to go back ,5,2016-03-23
3652,AMAZING,this year they are celebrating th diamond anniversary and the parade fireworks world of colour show are amazing rides are still fantastic and having use of the fast pass is so helpful highly recommend a minimum of day park hopper ,5,2016-03-21
3653,A fun way to spend a day!,my husband and i are near years old and we just spent hours at the parks having a fun time with no kids this was our first trip to disneyland and we loved it while we do walk fast and don t have kids to wrangle around we did all we wanted to do in disneyland in hours before heading over to california adventure we loved lunch at the cafe in french quarter area where we had a french dip sandwich that was delicious we also had a dole whip float the line for dole whips was very long so we gave money to a person at the front of the line to buy their dole whip and ours we loved the cheddar garlic bagel twist from maurice s treats too tons of good food around and a lot of fun rides even for adults the paint the night parade was neat to see and the fireworks show at pm was amazing complete with a flying tinkerbell look for her we didn t do any fast passes or planning in advance we just got there before the gates opened and were able to ride rides before they got too crowded then we got fast pass for another ride and did some single rider lines too loved our disney day ,5,2016-03-21
3654,Female traveling alone is the best way to do it!,i did the days and really didn t need the rd day as i was by myself if i had kids and other family the rd day may have been needed they don t seem to care if you bring in outside food coffee etc longest lines were from pm to about pm used this time to take naps at hotel or relax people line up for parades over an hour prior to parade best place to watch fireworks is in front of its a small world ,5,2016-03-20
3655,A great time and some new experiences,my friend and i met up for our biennial disneyland romp and return to childhood in the s as always it was a joy and we ve picked up many tips over the years to enhance the experience and most importantly work around the crowding we have learned that overall it s best to get an early start and go right to our favorite rides in our case these are in fantasyland where we have vivid childhood memories from our experience this area will always be mobbed with strollers everywhere as well as mobs of nostalgic adults like us in search of that childhood pixie dust best to stand in line and get it over with on the more popular rides such as peter pan and and alice in wonderland then go through the rest for the trip back in time wonderful and well worth it also fun to see all the young kids experiencing the magic and making memories that will last them a lifetime once fantasyland is unbearably crowded we make our way to the more spacious and uncrowded frontierland where our vivid memories of scampering and climbing give us a nice break from the mob scene across from the mark twain paddleboat we ve found a fish and chips place where we can take our food and sit outside good fish and a nice lunch with great views over the river we found if you have lunch early you may find the lines at pirates of the caribbean very thinned out as others break for lunch we try to go on this fantastic ride at least once daily during our stay seeking out quieter spots and lesser known rides as the crowds build we sometimes make the pilgrimage over to the winnie the pooh ride another little kid ride that we find relaxing and magical by early afternoon the park is usually broiling hot with little shade and sheets of people heading in both directions for us that means it s time for a break coffee conversation and people watching on main street then heading back to the hotel to relax by the pool until later in the day we always get park hopper tickets and on this trip we spent much more time at california adventure and found this was the perfect place to spend our evenings the first time we experienced dusk and nightfall there and enjoyed the beautiful lights over the harbor we were hooked the spaciousness and lower level of crowding at california adventure make the perfect complement to disneyland park so that we could enjoy our visit to the fullest we enjoyed the parades and small shows at both parks and got to see many disney characters posing for photos with fans while we were sitting across from the mark twain riverboat we could hear the sounds of a couple of cowpokes having a noisy argument just out of view the talented roving actors and musicians are one of the unique features of these parks we also briefly visited downtown disney which has many shops and restaurants on my arrival there before my friend flew in and our three day park hopper tickets began the next day i found out that no ticket is required for downtown disney it s a fun place to hang out before your visit even gets underway re shopping we ve found that if you re looking for disney gifts and memorabilia be sure to visit every shop you have time and energy to stop in we ve found that a certain item may be available at only one shop we visit so take note of where you see things you re interested in this trip i found the mr toad mug of my dreams at one tiny shop in fantasyland in all our trips to disneyland are always a grand time if we had one wish to make it would be for disney corp to lower the prices so many more kids can experience the magic and make memories that will sustain them for a lifetime ,5,2016-03-19
3656,Great experience,i went this this theme park couple times and i also went to orlando disneyland tokyo disneyland as well i will like california disneyland is a way far better than other two i ride most of the rode with my young daughter and she also love this disneyland more than tokyo s one staffs are very friend and well trained to deal with tourist besides we don t have to lineup for so long even we went there on saturday i don t think they allow to bring food inside but you can bring your own water the food price is still affordable without a fastpass most of the ride wait max minutes if you don t want to wait more than that go early during weekdays will even better ,5,2016-03-18
3657,It's the happiest place on earth!,my daughter couldn t have asked for a better th birthday present she had an amazing trip and we can t wait to go back biggest tip is to learn and use the fastpass system between fastpass and single rider lines we never waited more that minutes even for the most popular rides ,5,2016-03-17
3658,Price increase with less to do/see during construction. Is it really worth it?,ridiculously expensive for a park that is under construction with a lot of activites rides closed during the construction or down for maintenance lines are unbearable and often an hour plus in length fast pass that returns you at p m on rides that are high demand make it crazy and then there are the fast pass rides that seem to constantly go down indiana jones why isn t matterhorn a fast pass ride too food cost are outrageous only item that seemed semi reasonable is the turkey leg for a hot dog and chips and at that there were no condiments other than ketchup and mustard that hot dog also does not come with a drink sadly it s what young kids like so we bought them this is supposed to be a family park too but the foods seemed more in line with adult liking maybe it s time for the corporate folks to take a look at their menus food offerings and adjust them to meet the needs of young children and young adults throughout the park character pictures and autographs on disney sold books seemed crazy also lines formed so quick that the escorts normally cut the lines quickly my grandchildren tried often to be in the lines for the characters but we would normally be at or about the point just before the line was closed not sure how that can be addressed but maybe they need rotations of characters more frequently on the good side wait there was nothing that great even with fast pass it was a constant wait the only good side came during parades when everyone seemed to clear the lines to go to the parades shortening the otherwise hour or more long waits to about to minute waits good rainy day activity depends on the amount of rain seemed park wasn t as full yet still had pretty decent line lengths even with rain overall i still have to rate this as good and say to my title yes it was mostly worth it it was a first ever amusement park visit for my grandchildren whom flew in from texas and they seemed to thoroughly enjoyed the experience even if they did get impatient at times with the waiting and the unavailable attractions that they had hoped to experience they loved the characters that were available to them for pictures and autographs and i am hoping this will otherwise be a lasting memory for them footnote why star wars land disney didn t do the original production of star wars seems like a waste of prime land that could be used for a more disney type adventure if it s a competition with universal because of harry potter i fear disney is making a bad choice obviously george lucas didn t see the need for an amusement park themed after his movie so why is disney going there my opinion strictly though ,3,2016-03-17
3659,What a disappointment,it was disneyland you expect certain things we had breakdowns on almost every ride c mon disney been going there since the s never been more disappointed fix the rides with as much money as they make you would think they would take better care of their park ,2,2016-03-11
3660,Very good but crowded,we went on a thursday and friday and there were crowds even when you had early entry we still enjoyed our visit but will not return as the park was just too busy it must be hell at weekends ,4,2016-03-09
3661,"Fun, but you need to know strategies to avoid long lines.",we went to both disneyland and disneyland california adventure in the same day we got there around and finished most of the rides we wanted to go to by pm if you want to avoid long lines i recommend their disneyland app which sort of tells you their wait times i also recommend getting fast passes that are free in both parks you can only get a fastpass after you used your first one or at the time it says you can get a new one at the bottom of the fastpass when you get a fastpass you could get in line for another ride until you can get another fastpass or until you can ride the ride you had the fastpass for make sure to get a fastpass for the most popular rides first so that later you can enjoy the rest if you go to california adventure park and want to go on the cars racers get the fastpass as soon as possible they go really quick i think they are gone by or earlier if you have any questions and if i could answer them please let me know ,4,2016-03-09
3662,Wasn't what I expected,i visited here in october it was my first time ever visiting any disney land after growing up watching disney films i had high expectations however when i got there i felt that it was not as good as people said it was i know disney is mostly based for young children but there quite a lot of young adults myself included that enjoy everything to do with disney so i was disappointed when most of there attractions were based for younger children i would ve liked to see something for older ones however they did have some good rides such as space mountain and splash mountain for young adults i would recommend universal studios instead ,3,2016-03-08
3663,The magic is dimming...,we used the lines app and tried very hard to pick the quietest days but it was a zoo maybe always is now which took most of the joy out of it disney needs to manage crowds much better for the vast amount of money we all pay dca was quite a bit better but sadly i am not sure if we will be back to either of them though i did really enjoy the night parades and a couple of the rides at dca too much waiting and being squashed in crowds for not enough fun overall sad miss the way it used to be ,3,2016-03-07
3664,Loosing magic,after years of attending as annual pass holder the park is loosing its charm and disney professionalism the crowds are getting larger price is up and the general clientele are getting rude what used to be happy courteous staff has changed and no longer as helpful my pass had issues that they could not solve the first day of the visit and after a half hour wait outside the gate they let me in with a one day pass and an assurance that this it issue would be fixed the next day next day no fix wait outside for minutes and finally after a long verbal exchange about it may take a month since it had a backlog one person stepped up and repaired the problem even if for only a short time as a paying customer i was unable to gain quick access treated like i did something wrong and had no access to my benefits for two days the magic for me has gone ,3,2016-03-05
3665,magical destination,my princess was floored by all the magic and the surreal experiences this place is well organized to meet everyones needs ,5,2016-03-03
3666,Disneyland Never Again, crazy long lines annual pass holders make it a joke lots of rides closed and broken down throughout the day once the parade starts you get treated like cattle by unfriendly staff when my and year old ask to leave after dinner you know something is wrong disney is all about the mighty they could care less about the families ,2,2016-02-27
3667,Truly Is The Happiest Place On Earth,this was our second trip to disneyland this time we did xmas day and the following days there we had previously done new years eve there so thought we were prepared for the crowds but wow nothing compares to xmas day i think all up we did maybe rides and the amount of people was insane the line up for security check was about hr but better to be safe and have everyone checked once in it truly was magical even with all the people boxing day we used our magic morning pass and it was so worth it we smashed out about rides in the first hrs so we weren t bothered when the park filled up again tickets for us aussies is a bit pricey setting us back roughly au for our family of for day hopper passes but with the as it was we went prepared for the price food throughout disney is amazing with something for everyone and every budget defiantly go to disney with a plan use fast passes wisely sit down each night back in your hotel and plan your attack for the next day it truly does help with getting to see and do just about everything yes lines can be sooooo long but really again its disneyland as long as you go prepared you will have a great time regardless of the crowds ,5,2016-02-24
3668,Why are you even asking???,happiest place on earth my and year old and myself loved every minute pirates of caribbean and indiana jones are awesome take bottled water and snacks for kids in backpack b c it is super expensive bottle water go to tiki lounge area and get dole ice cream floats so yummy nemo submarine ride was one of my favorites must try the churros ,5,2016-02-23
3669,Great but could use some improvements,entertaining only did park didn t do the adventure park since we only went day i went with an ur old boy and he was pretty entertained be prepared to overpay or some tips get ecv or stroller before going in that is the only location to rent one otherwise you are sol unless you feel like walking back only smoking area in the whole place as per map north of tomorrowland behind that mountain no bueno for smokers i asked an employee supposedly there s another one behind haunted mansion in new orleans but didn t see it water fountains are scarce you are force to buy water at almost bring a camelback or something rail is not working due to work on developing starwars area pain to walk all the way around download the app and or plan day strategically app or site shows rides that are down a lot of them so plan accordingly as well exit to left goes to shuttles going to resorts n etc tram to garage is on exit to the right these are not clear upon exit and u have to walk all the way accross upon leaving at closing escalator to rd floor mickey parking was broken either suffer waiting in line w strollers after you ve walked all day or go up the stairs to rd floor here s a tip we took escalator to th floor then caught elevator down to rd lol no charging stations anywhere in park there are a few charging lockers which are hard to find and or are usually sold right away bring those portable charging banks if you plan on using ur phone for photos all day app is excellent especially if u use your gps location but might drain battery see if you ll be there multiple days best time to go on rides are during parade fireworks lines are empty so night to see parade n maybe nd night to make up for rides if u don t mind missing parade nd time around characters were hard to come by app shows you but by the time u get there they r finishing up,3,2016-02-23
3670,Enough with the Star Wars,well disney will always be disney but now it s starting to seem like they ll just do whatever makes the most money or maybe even more so than before i know they bought star wars but that franchise could almost be its own park i don t mind a few rides related to it but it s starting to feel like they are try to force two things together that are totally different the kids still love the disney but it s not going to be the same experience as it had been for the last years ,4,2016-02-22
3671,Happiest place on earth,i ve been lucky enough to travel to disneyland several times and i ve loved every trip from the rides to the foods and all the characters it doesn t matter whether your or once you step through those front gates everyone has a spring in their step it really is a magical place ,5,2016-02-18
3672,First time,this was my first time and i think is overrated most people are locals that abuse of the anual pass and sometimes use the park as day care the lines were too long the food is bad and expensive one churro nothing really special ,3,2016-02-17
3673,1st time visit,try to enter the park as soon as it opens in the morning pick a couple of rides that you feel you must ride and get fast passes as soon as you can if you need to use a locker they are located halfway down main street on the right hand side they are for the day for an average size locker we fit a good size bag in the locker along with four sweatshirts we walked from our hotel to save on parking we stayed at the hyatt it was mile walk from our hotel to disneyland ,5,2016-02-16
3674,Always a great place to visit.,disneyland has been apart of my family for years and now i m taking my grandkids it s busier then ever but still worth the money to go,5,2016-02-16
3675,Still the most magical place,we love all things disney and there is no more of a magical place than disneyland every cast member is exceptional all around always a great family adventure,5,2016-02-16
3676,Not as magical as one would hope...,we decided to travel to take a trip to disneyland and i m sad to say that it isn t what we hoped it would be i think the biggest let down was the staff my husband and i found a lot of the staff and crew members to be rude and not as helpful as we anticipated aside from that we had a fun day and enjoyed seeing disneyland but i don t think we would take a trip back for a long time if you live in california or nearby then going to disneyland is a no brainer but if you have to travel there by plane i would say go to disney world people there are nicer ,3,2016-02-16
3677,Magical!,we were there background this was my first trip in years i am over still like most rides but my main reason for going was to help with little ones i went with my daughter her husband and children ages mo yrs old we have been to wdw several times over the last few years and i was anxious to note some differences weather great we missed the rainy sunday monday and tuesday were cool and we wore jackets or coats all day but wednesday was warmer and thursday ended up hotter resulting in some sunburns in spite of sunblock cooler days made the lines for splash mountain about minutes the kids rode several times they welcomed grizzly falls on thursday accommodations we stayed in a family suite at the castle inn not fancy but clean and we had bedrooms bath with an extra sink in the bedroom king size and queen size beds plenty of towels a microwave and fridge it worked out great for us the kids loved the castle theme it was a great location it is a short and easy walk to the parks minutes from our room to bag check i love that there are so many places to stay within waking distance to the park we chose a day non park hopper pass which was cheaper for us than a day park hopper this was a great choice for us and with the time we went there was no need for us to change parks we did ca monday and thursday and dl tuesday and wednesday we were at california adventure the first morning by bag check was relatively short and we easily exchanged our vouchers for tickets we got in line a realized it was for early entry disney resort guests only we decided to go to downtown disney which was a mistake because by the time we went through bag check again the lines were really long oh well they let you in the park about but the crowd is is held in carthay circle we headed right to radiator springs for what was already a minute wait we used the child swap and so some of the kids were able to ride twice it was my favorite ride there was a really long line at the fp distribution for rrs when we first entered and so went back later for fp to ride again we used child swap and fast pass for the rides we could and rarely had more than a minute wait tip whoever was waiting for the child swap would go and get our next fast passes other than radiator springs head to toy story mania first off because it does not have fp and lines get long i was also able to take the little ones to monster inc and chew chew train several times while waiting one morning my favorite time in both parks was at night there are fewer people and it is gorgeous many rides are enhanced in the dark including tower of terror big thunder mountain splash mountain and radator springs a real must on our nd day it was our early entry day and we headed right to space mountain minute wait and child swap headed to the matterhorn with about minute wait we were able to ride everything we wanted except peter pan our nd morning we rushed right there and the line was already really long like clear out of the entrance to fantasyland we chose not to wait and never made it back the theater production of tangled was hilarious the princess meet and greet was a short line and they were so cute especially with the baby the year old was inches and rode everything everyday that he was tall enough for at least once but winnie the pooh was his favorite and convenient for when child swapping in the area toon town does not open until am which is kind of a bummer it was fun for the kids and the littlest loved the little play area while doing child swap minnie s house is darling and the wait abou minutes mickeys looked short and said only minutes but was really long once you got inside after minutes and not even close we left it would be nice to have more places to meet mickey we enjoyed meeting many other characters at different timesin the parks ride closures there are always some during a slow time of the year and we knew that going in we did however experience temporary closures for rsr buzz lightyear splash mountain indiana jones and a few others while inconvenient we were able to use our fast passes to ride later it is hard to explain to a yr old though food we ate breakfast in our room but lunch and dinner at the parks it was all surprisingly good and portions were large enough in general to share thanks for all your suggestions highlights pacific wharf we shared soup bowls and a chicken walnut salad which was also served in a sour dough bread bowl all were reallygood flo s we had the ribs chicken and the roast beef all were good and the sides were surprisingly good i loved the cole slaw and pasta salad the kids liked the mac and cheese pizza port was pretty good the curry pizza was really good the pesto pasta just ok bengal bbq we tired the chicken beef and bacon wrapped asparagus skewers we liked the chicken best but liked the chicken the best here was the only place we went back and ordered more because the portions were smaller the chocolate chip cookies were really good too if there are not tables near here go through to new orleans and there is a terrace area with a to of tables you can eat at we made reservations for cafe orleans and had the legendary monte cristo oh my goodness so yummy we ordered but would have been plenty for all of us the fries were really good as welland the portion large we took the left over sandwiches and our orders of beignets back for later cozy cone we tried all flavor so of the bread cones and found them surprisingly tasty i liked the chili and pulled pork the best a bit hard to share but there was plenty for all we had an early breakfast adr at storyteller cafe in the grand californian a very good buffet and good character interaction loved the eggs benedict and the caramel french toast we were able to use the private park entry by showing our receipt you avoid the long bag check and ticket lines but end up at the same place in carthay circle all in all it was a great trip and i can t wait to go back it was liking meeting up with an old aquaintance and becoming great friends anxious to get back together ,5,2016-02-10
3678,Overpriced and so crowded,went on a saturday which i think was a big mistake of the rides we wanted to see were closed and the line ups for the rest were minutes only able to use fast passes most food concessions had very long line ups except the seafood one which was very efficient so many rides took people but only got on only one ride called out for couples to fill the cars i felt we were ripped off ,3,2016-02-09
3679,THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!,since i was years old i ve been in love with this place i really like that you can do pretty much everything in a day if you have to but i recommend at least to days if it s your first time there with day passes you can spend one day at each park and save money on the hopper pass with a day hopper pass though you get access to the magic mornings which will get you into the park an hour early on certain days check the disneyland website for which days are available for magic mornings getting in an hour early may seem like not a big deal but it saves you lots of time especially if you like to get a locker and coffee before riding rides or if you head straight to your favorite rides there are basically no lines d it s magical hence the name space mountain and star tours always have a long wait time so we usually hit up all the major rides in tomorrow land first get a fast pass throughout the day at the major rides there are tons of articles that talk about fast pass tricks so i won t go into that here i don t have any kiddos so i can t offer too much advice to parents but i know that they have a breakfast with the disney princesses that is apparently amazing also pack a sharpie and liquid skin antibiotic write your phone number on your child s hand arm and set it with the liquid skin if they get separated from you god forbid you ll receive a call make sure you download the disney mobile app so you can look up the wait times for rides and plan which attractions you d like to see and when it s consistently warm and sunny in california but plan to bring a light jacket with you and maybe a pair of jeans for the evenings it gets kinda chilly in the winter spring months check weather com for the latest weather predictions before you pack omg wear comfortable walking shoes do not wear flip flops unless you re confident they won t tear your feet to shreds don t worry about the way the look wear sneakers tennis shoes or a sandal that you can latch your feet will thank me later if you do get blisters pack some waterproof band aides or the strong fabric ones those are the best you might have to change them throughout the day but it s better than bloody feet also i always bring a second pair of shoes and change of clothing to leave in a locker in case i need them later you never know what you ll need to save on money and time you can pack snacks and leave them in a locker or carry them with you i usually pack something easy to eat like trail mix without the chocolates or snack bars something that won t melt during the day if you re carrying it with you also water is very accessible throughout the park so i bought a flexible water bottle and fill that throughout the day or you ask for a cup with ice and fill that up with water for a quick drink stay hydrated ,5,2016-02-09
3680,Always a blast,disneyland is classic fun for the whole family we live in arizona but love it so much that we purchased annual passes this year so that we could go as much as possible the character meet and greets allow you meet most all of your favorites and the rides are so much fun from the classics like dumbo and it s a small world to the new hyperspace mountain there s something for everyone and with all the food they have to eat it s lucky that you have plenty of room to walk off all those calories from open to close disneyland is always fun fun fun ,5,2016-02-09
3681,Too crowded! Too expensive!,as much as i love disneyland and live close by after my last visit last year i d vowed i d never go there again disneyland is all about making i am so disappointed the prices just keep going up everything in the park i e food and souvenirs are just too expensive and the crowd unbelievable an average wait to get on a ride is around hours you d be lucky if you could enjoy rides in day ,2,2016-02-08
3682,"HUGE Disney fan, but a little disappointing",okay let me qualify this review a bit i lived in florida near the disney empire for years i ve read books written by former executives about the disney concept and i ve visited the florida parks hundreds of times literally disneyland was a little disappoint for me in comparison the footprint of this park is quite small but that s okay unless there s a big crowd we decided to visit on the big game sunday in the evening the place was packed and it literally felt like standing in an elevator with thousands of people it was difficult to move lines were super long even by theme park standards minutes for any ride means you oversold the park i also noticed a lot of pealing paint dirty surfaces and overgrown foliage these are things i never experienced at a disney property before i know our experience would have been better with a significantly smaller crowd but friends who live in the are tell me that s only on a weekday if at all locals visit on the weekends and there are a lot of annual pass holders if you are a huge disney fan it s worth a visit to say you ve been to both the california and florida properties ,3,2016-02-08
3683,"Horribly packed at the slowest time of the year. Gross, gross lineups. Never again!",saying i hate disneyland feels like an evil that should not be spoken aloud but here it is we visited during the week in february because we read that the crowds are smallest at this time while this may be true the place is still the busiest place i ve ever been except for india no seriously by the weekend there was a soul destroying lineup to simply get through security just so that you could get into the life sucking lineup to actually get into the park so that you could cram yourself through the mortifying crowds to line up for every single thing kids were crying melting down everywhere parents were trying to pretend they were happy that they spent each to do this and on that last morning i felt only dread and actual horror at the prospect of going in thank god for california adventure park shining like an oasis on the opposite side once through the security line we surveyed the gross gross line to disneyyland and our and year olds both said i m not goin in that so we headed across the way to california adventure with no line to get in whatsoever while the attractions are pretty amazing both parks have the same thing going on to control the crowds outside each one wrap the line accordion style in and out of walls that will both hide the hideous lineup from view and keep it tightly controlled so as not to block the walkways though disneyland i understand this but thought it was also pretty deceptive because honestly one look at the actual lineup for those attractions in its full glory would make you turn and run for the hills while i appreciate the quality of the attractions i just am not happy to wait minimum minutes for each one the most popular can be minutes plus waiting time california adventure was better on this front as we seemed to breeze in and out of most things but i truly think that was blind luck right time right place by breeze in and out i mean wait only minutes per attraction btw people rave about fast passes but for the or attractions that actually give them in each park letting you rapidly enter between appointed times you can only hold a couple at once so you certainly can t rely on this method all day long when we wanted lunch even the restaurants had minute waits and that was at i get that you can strategize your day to maximize your time but when i m on vacation no thanks fact no matter what you re going to spend of your day walking from lineup to lineup and waiting in line this was my assumption going in but no one who has been said it out loud i am saying it out loud ,2,2016-02-08
3684,Happiest place on earth....sort of...,it was nice to take our boys and walk down memory lane with them the weather was perfect we chose to go in feb as it is a slower time to be at the park we can t imagine going in the heat of summer and standing in hr line ups it s worth it to take the kids out of school and go in the slower cooler season it felt quite busy and there were definitely line ups and fast passes to be used it s expensive that s for sure and as far as we are concerned the best place to eat is the chinese food place at california adventure oh grab a double margarita directly across from there the cars radiator springs is a terrific ride and a must all in all it was a fun trip to take would we go again hmm maybe when our boys have kids of their own i think we will save our money and take the them else where for a lot less money and virtually line up free in comparison ps wear good walking shoes your tired achy feet will thank you pps when you want to stop to pull something out of your stroller or bag step to the side please and if you want to take a leisurely stroll not sure if disney is the place to do that people move at a good clip and are often racing around trying to make their fast pass time last thing they need is the person in front of them making an abrupt stop or mr slow poke taking his sweet time it s disney people move ,3,2016-02-06
3685,Ohana Vacation 2016 - Disneyland!,our family has been going to disneyland almost every year since it truly is the happiest place on earth this year is the th diamond anniversary celebration so make sure you catch disney s paint the night parade and the fireworks show right after it is truly amazing make sure you re somewhere on main street or by the castle to get the best view ,5,2016-02-02
3686,Must do Research and be Patient. But it's Magical!,i ve been to disneyland probably a dozen times and yes the lines are and have always been the worst part but not enough to stop us from enjoying our time there do your research this will allow everyone from the first timer to the disney vet to evaluate whether it s worth going doing research will help you find out what attractions are closed high crowd seasons and any new rules events disney has in store go on pinterest blogs or disneys website for the info either get over the long lines or don t most disney lovers don t mind them bc your whole day or two is about magic and lines don t put a damper on that so let s say you get to the most magical place on earth download the line apps it s a live app that tells you what attractions are open or closed and how long the lines are this is a great way to check to see when a ride is closed in the am but opens up later bc you ll be able to see a ten min wait for splash mountain disney characters don t roam the park like you like to think they are stationed in very specific areas for a specific amount of time again the blogs and such will help you find your character if you want to i can t say enough that i just love coming here hot and stuffy and lines i always leave just loving it a bit more ,4,2016-01-31
3687,Magical Memories,my husband and i love going to disneyland we visited disney world once and won t go back it just doesn t have the same magic as the original we are prejudiced we admit it having gone here on our honeymoon celebrated a wedding anniversary here both of us having celebrated birthdays here a couple of memories stand out as to why you should go back again my favourite spot in the entire park standing in the pass through of sleeping beauty s castle with people rushing by on either side of me as i stand transfixed listening to jiminy cricket sing when you wish upon a star nothing makes me feel more calm and puts a smile on my face than that if you haven t yet visited on your birthday please do nothing like having tons of people all day wish you a happy birthday the first time we were at disneyland for my husband s birthday he wasn t certain he wanted to be singled out with the happy birthday pin it only took one little boy in line for indiana jones to excitedly say hey it s my birthday too to melt my husband s heart and agree it was special every one of us has our favourite rides for me it s space mountain probably because the speed makes me laugh right out loud each time i am on it whatever is your favourite make it a point of going on that ride first thing each time it will reinforce the fun and remind you why you love coming to disneyland it s not about rushing to new rides it s also the fun of reminding yourself what you love about being there i also would suggest looking at main street in a different way sure we ve walked it many times on our way to the rides next time enjoy the stroll reminding yourself which stores you want to visit when you need a break if you haven t dropped in to see walt disney s office please do the man was obviously a genius and taking the time to pay tribute to the creator of this magical place will be well worth it and being able to show your children that an individual man was responsible for the vision just may instill some creativity and ideas in your own finally some of us get to that point where we ve had enough rides while the rest of us are keen to keep going rather than try and keep this as a family event where everyone has to do the same thing recognize that we are not all on the same wavelength at home so why would that be different here my husband doesn t have the stamina or interest in continuing on rides like i do he makes his way to downtown disney and relaxes while i head back on rides for a second or third time if you have never gone on the rides alone do it you re surrounded by people who want to be there too and most times you ll be seated alone don t let others keep you from fully enjoying what you want to do can t wait to make more magical memories ,5,2016-01-30
3688,one day is enouhh,unless you are a disney fanatic one day is all you need at disneyland we were advised to get a day pass as there is so much to do our first day was fantastic the nd we went to disney california adventure which is ok but can easily be missed as nothing special and on the rd we went back to disneyland by then we were all disneyed out we had done all the rides on the first day so we spent our time eating shopping and going on some of the rides more suited for toddlers the most amazing thing about disneyland is the detail put into everything it is amazing the parades are a must and the fireworks amazing be prepared to queue this i expected so i wasn t stressed and disney is so well organised that the queues move pretty quickly having to pay us for parking everyday you visit the park is a rip off especially when you consider it costs a family of nearly a us for the day pass you d think they could throw in the parking for free food and souvenirs are also expensive so go for one day do and see as much as you can go mid week when less crowded take lots of money accept that you will be in a lot of queues and have a wonderful time ,4,2016-01-25
3689,Hype does not live up to expectations.,steer clear of the new year time period as we had four days of not being able to access rides and fireworks cancelled with no notification in queues many times for over an hour to have the ride break down and having to start again too many people with rides not always functioning was a major disappointment ,1,2016-01-23
3690,Great time but very crowded,we spent christmas and new years in disneyland we did an day trip and purchased the day hopper park pass and went off site on the other days knowing we were going in the most busiest time of the year we were not surprised about the crowds but you must at least once experience disneyland at the holidays it is magical and the holiday decorations are amazing they have the christmas parade in addition to the paint the night parade and even california adventure has a holiday world of color show aside from the wait time my kids and had a blast most lines for rides were about to hours even using fast pass we missed our fast pass times waiting in line for other rides however i thought even though the wait was long that you were still moving the food at the plaza inn is great other than that we only got quick bites at the turkey leg hot dog stands in fantasyland they have a stand that has humus and fresh fruits which was great the shopping was fun a lot of repeats however frontierland was my favorite with a lot of old west themed items also to find a store that embroiders your name on your mickey ears are not easily found but mad hatter at the beginning of main st has a huge selection and are fast the parades were awesome but had to sit in our spot about hours before it began if not you will not be able to see as the crowds were so huge we didn t see a lot of characters around the park however the character breakfast at plaza inn had characters each day we went my daughter met minnie chip dale eeyore pooh tigger captain hook peter pan max the mice of cinderella rafiki our second breakfast there we were one of the last people there so pooh tigger were playing charades with my son husband on who their favorite characters in star wars are the sky launch bay in tommorowland is a must do no lines unless you want to be a jedi and good shopping for star wars and super hero items they have xbox area that my year was excited with glad we got to experience autotopia fantastmic jungle cruise mark twain riverboat pirates lair on tom sawyers island and they are all closed for an undisclosed time with exception of autotopia to make way for the new star wars land sadly big thunder ranch will be closed permanently for star wars land take a stroller if you have young kids my daughter is and fought me in the beginning of riding in stroller because she is not a baby but both us were so glad we bought one after standing line for hours she was ready to be pushed around it was safer too when the crowds were large after a show or parade that we didn t get separated by all the people pushing to get out for that you can do and see the cost of admission to me is fair the food and shopping are expensive but its disney its worth it ,4,2016-01-21
3691,Smaller Disneyworld,it was my first time here and comparing it to disneyworld it s not much of a difference it s still fun rides are enjoyable and the expirience is one in a lifetime but lines are ridiculously long just like disneyworld my only downfall is the fast pass i would try to get a more organized and better system of having people get them and get on the rides ,4,2016-01-20
3692,Very disappointing!!,after traveling to many different places in america recently we decided to visit disneyland and california park at the end of our trip before returning to australia we were very disappointed when we arrived with prepaid tickets to find out that between the two parks there were major rides closed i cannot understand how they can charge the same price and close so many attractions we complained but very little understanding or compassion was shown i will certainly be advising anyone who is planning to visit to phone before buying tickets to find out which rides are not operating ,1,2016-01-19
3693,All you hope and know it to be!,this park is a little smaller castle also smaller than the magic kingdom in florida but many of the attractions are the same and in the same places it is magical for all ages but part of the park is closed for refurbishment adding star wars land can t wait tomorrowland has been star wars ized which made space mountain extremely cool and way more fun than the generic space ride it has been for years star tours was even updated for the new the force awakens movie with finn and bb just need to ditch jar jar binks can t believe he s still in this attraction star wars music and characters abound if you are not a star wars nut which i am you may not like the changes but we loved them indiana jones which is a great franchise was a little underwhelming it needs some new technology it is similar to the dino ride at animal kingdom but nowhere near as fun we unfortunately missed the parades which are always great but we did see a ton of characters if you have girls visit the royal hall where you can see princesses in one place very cool and a special experience snow white and cinderella were in character and spot on use the fast pass system still baffles me that most do not very weird that people will stand in line for over and hour when they can fast pass and go do something else and come back a little later and walk on the ride in minutes even on busy days wanted to ride the bobsleds but the line was always really long and no fast passes not sure why great experience and love having the two parks side by side for easy access and touring with downtown disney also right there and pairing it all with the grand californian next door what s not to like ,5,2016-01-18
3694,First time,it was our family s first time and won t be our last we stayed at a hotel across from the gates but it was busy in disney land and california adventure but we can not compare it because it was our first time will be back ,5,2016-01-14
3695,Prohibitively expensive,disneyland is now over a ticket even for kids i took my year old niece and my year old son in the beginning of december and even the kids were put off by the park my niece said everything looked old and broken rides were closed lines were obscene we went on a tuesday to avoid weekend crowds and averaging hour waits per ride it was a solid expenditure for of us to eat crappy burgers and fries in the park most of the trash cans in the park were full and overflowing on to the ground which seems pretty bad for a park taking in a fortune in admissions every day by the time it started to get dark i had to struggle to get the kids to stay they were bored and tired of standing in line i convinced them to stay and watch the parade but so many people were packed together that we were wedged into a corner where we could barely see conversely i took the same kids to knotts berry farm with three of my friends and had fun all day and went out for dinner all for less money than i spent just on park tickets for disney neither of the kids has asked to go back but we visit knott s two or three times a year i think disney hurts the wallet more than it is enjoyable ,1,2016-01-14
3696,You can never go wrong with a trip to Disneyland!,as an annual pass holder i obviously love disneyland i ve been at every different time of the year you could think of here are some of my best quick tips if you are going to spend more than one day or plan to come back with in the year buy and annual pass disneyland tickets are expensive this is not new news to anyone investing in an annual pass is a great idea especially for socal residents you can park hop with an annual pass and receive discounts through out the parks and hotels purchasing tickets always get the park hopper yes it is more expensive but its worth it to go to both parks if you are spending more than one day you can opt for doing one park per day if you would like and i would suggest purchasing before online when to go its well known that disneyland is visited all year round however there are peak seasons try to avoid the park at this time if possible my favorite times to visit are during the week tues thurs in jan feb oct nov if you want to see the parks at christmastime go before everyone is off school for winter break the second week of december on a tues or weds is usually a safe bet the parks are crowded during christmas and new years since its southern california the weather is usually good and on the warmer side most of the year if you are traveling to the parks in the summer season end of may beg of aug it will be warm bring the sunblock and a light sweater for evening if you get cold easily like me dont let the rain scare you away it doesn t rain often but if its raining you better believe i m there the parks are what i would consider empty on rainy days most of the attractions are inside or covered so you don t have to worry about it too much and the lines are always short i ve been on sunday s which are usually a busy day but the rain tends to scare people off so it felt like we had the park to ourselves superbowl sunday and play offs if you don t have big plans to watch the big games consider going to the parks on these sunday s if you can t make the trip during the week just about every holiday is busy i stay away from the parks on these days must dos parades get a good seat if you have kiddos if you are with a group take turns saving your spot i usually go with my daughter and we get ice cream and relax for awhile in our spot i would say grab a spot at least min before if you are there on a not so busy day and at least an hour on a busy day sometimes an hour and a half for a prime sitting spot if you aren t into watching the parades this is a good time to ride some rides a lot of areas are roped off and a good chunk of people are watching the parade so the ride lines aren t as crowded especially on a winter weekday fast passes these are a must if you re visiting on a weekend or peak season day even if you are there on a not so busy day or time they are still a good idea but if you plan your trip right you won t need them winter weekdays especially in california adventure are quite dead so rides like screamin and tower or terror you can walk right on or wait no more than min for just for the kids no way some of my best disney trips have been adults only california adventure has some great spots for wine and beer a yummy rita stop and fun rides for adults disneyland has fabulous eats and classic must do rides that call for height requirements eats i ve never been disappointed by a disney snack or meal my favorites are a turkey leg in california adventure churros from either park a mickey pretzel and some ice cream both parks offer the same snacks but its smart to bring your own as well especially if you are traveling with kids not to mention the prices of food in the parks are pretty steep i usually eat before entering the parks and have snacks through out the day if we want an actual meal we usually head to downtown disney then make our way back into the parks my best advice is to visit the parks during the off season anytime during the winter on a weekday the summer months are packed even during the week make sure your bellies are full before going into the park and bring snacks for yourself and the kiddos if you don t want to spend a ton of money when going to the parks with my daughter age i bring dollar store glow sticks so shes somewhat distracted from all the overpriced light up toys on every corner doesn t always work but it helps always bring a light jacket if you plan on staying through nightfall and you don t have to wear tennis shoes i ve done the parks in sandals but make sure your shoes are comfortable because you will be walking standing most of the day bring a water bottle with you you can refill them throughout the parks if you are traveling with a group designate a meeting spot because no matter how many cell phones you have or how close you plan to stay something always seems to happen and its good to have a place to go just in case if you are debating on whether or not a trip to disneyland is worth it hands down it is even if you have to go in the peak season its still a great time ,5,2016-01-12
3697,Little Halloween magic and falling apart rides....,it was our second visit to disneyland due to our curiosity to enjoy the park during halloween period in october unfortunatelly it made us a couple to reconsider to come here for the third time in the near future the main reason for our disappointment was falling apart rides same as a year ago nemo ride was closed due to technical problems half of rides in tomorrowland wasn t operating making waiting lines for the other rides in the land of future to be enormous for instance we spent minutes waiting to ride on the space mountain built in s can you imagine how huge line was for the brand new star tours ride however even if you will survive in the minutes waiting line you might stuck again in the ride itself for example we stuck in splash mountain ride right before it s huge drop it was scary to be balancing on the top and listening to the scary atmospheric song sang by the poor rabbit even that it was halloween it still didn t make us feel happily scared we also learned from the staff members that disneyland is planning to close half of the rides in order to bring new attractions related to star wars and marvel worlds as a result half of the park will be closed for more than a year we wonder if already half of the rides aren t working then what will be left at the end of the day and how big lines will be for those several working rides plus no one is expecting to decrease already huge usd ticket price speaking of halloween the decorations were nice but the whole atmosphere of halloween was blurred because of disneyland s th anniversary for instance day and night parades had no attributes of halloween the final firework above the main castle was all about the anniversary at least there was a special event of the nightmare before christmas in the haunted mansion besides this ride and several pumpkins around the territory of the park there was nothing else because of the horrible service not working rides huge lines and insane prices we could easily put for disneyland this time instead we will put as there is still some little magic left in this place we couldn t held our tears during firework above disneyland even that it was last disneyland s firework for us for many years from now on ,4,2016-01-11
3698,cali vacation,my child loved disney land we had a blast with her she got to see so many characters we had reservations at ariel s grotto where my child got to take several pictures with ariel my child was only years old when we took her and she still remembers mostly everything the lines can get big we went in september so it was just right weather was also good above all any kid adult will love disney land the light show and water show with fireworks they do are magical ,5,2016-01-09
3699,You are never too old to enjoy this magical place.,this review is intended for baby boomers who were around when this park was born out of one mans imagination we visit the park almost every year from out of state at the height of the winter holiday season including new year s eve and this review is intended for those daring enough to visit the park during the busiest days of the year believe everything you read in the guide books about the challenges you will face when visiting crowds are daunting and tightly compacted with cast members trying their best to keep guests from creating human traffic bottlenecks which happen more often than one would like to admit men don t laugh at the women in line at the restrooms as this time of year you will also be waiting so plan accordingly waiting in line can cause tension and no one is inclined to give cuts simply because you have a pained look there are a few lesser frequented facilities and i will suggest the area by winnie pooh and the adjacent dinning venue offers shorter waits unless your diet allows you fast food and you don t mind waiting an hour or more for stand up dinning dinner reservations booked well in advance are an absolute must on new year s eve like other major holidays on a rare occasion the parks will shut down admissions when they reach capacity we book dinner for the park we plan on being at all day we arrive as early as we are able and don t leave the park until we are finished late in the evening if you have the ability to splurge for dinner carthay circle at california adventure and blue bayou at disneyland are better venues if you appreciate a slightly more mature ambiance and menu and don t have grandkids to feed the nostalgia and quality of service and food at carthay are really quite remarkable if service seems a bit rushed just tell your server to slow it down and they will comply accordingly if you are like me and in the same age range as the park but still filled with childhood memories of your first visit find senior cast members and let them share with you the magic behind the scenes that still make this a magical experience even as the crowd presses in around you tiki maynard at the enchanted tiki room makes this tried and true disney oldie sparkle with new life as he enriches every show with humor and excellent voice characterizations that easily best the birds grandma pat is always working the fairy tale theatre venue now staging frozen and her stories of early park history walt julie andrews dick van dyke and other personages who have visited over the years is worth the price of admission she is the personification of professionalism and discretion so don t expect anything too gossipy but her insights into unique features about the park and its history easily rivals what the new cast members in those checkered vests can offer sorry no offense to all that disney university education which is incredibly impressive but hearing it from those who have nearly a lifetime of service committed to sustaining magic and imagination is something millions of us who are of a different generation value greatly park rides are rated by myriads of travel and park aficionados so my only caveat is you may want to heed those park warning signs or ask a cast member directly about the nature of the ride before jumping on board we spend a considerable amount of time enjoying the theatre venues such as mickeys magical map and aladdin which have incredible production value and very talented cast members with great voices and their fair share of acting talent sadly aladdin is going dark permanently to make way for another frozen production according to cast members while you do a considerable amount of walking which everyone warns you about what you may not have heard about is the standing for hours which is normal if you visit during the holidays no matter what dinner show package you buy get to that venue early and then plan on standing for an hour or more if you really want good views your feet legs and spine will take a real beating being still and in an upright position for an hour at a time why do we still go at the most challenging time of the year the holiday decor is always beautiful some rides like haunted mansion and the venerable jungle cruise have been significantly reformatted to better reflect a christmas theme the park keeps that special christmas magic around just a little longer while the rest of the commercial world is ready to move on the day after christmas if you are still a lover of what walt and his mouse created for us anytime of the year at disneyland still a good time to visit remember to exercise patience and understanding to all and be a good role model even when everyone else around you seem oblivious to the simplest courtesy ,5,2016-01-07
3700,Overpriced and over crowded.,been coming here since worked here for wed in the late sixties doubt that i will ever return of my own choice only if a grandchild twists my arm no longer a park feel just business everywhere ,1,2016-01-07
3701,Good but busy,i thought i did well planning after new years for it to be less crowded wrong the staff was pleasant as always their disability rider system worked well for my child if there was a way to figure it out for meet n greet area too would be great like for mickey will be back ,4,2016-01-05
3702,Awesome!!,our little aussie family of loved it we visited the st week in sept and the crowds and waiting times were at a minimum food was great we used the toy story parking facility so the shuttle to and from there was hassle free ,5,2016-01-04
3703,"Great time, but long lines",had a great time booking a day pass with one early morning we used the fast pass option where we could the fast pass option is on the more popular rides which means you can gate a fats pass which takes you to the a different line between a specified period so you go to a ride with the fast pass machine say am and the machine will spit out a fast pass ticket for whatever times are available for example am so you just go between these times in the fast pass line you can only get fast pass at a time between the fast pass times but you can go between the parks and have multiple fast passes the cars ride has a very long line and getting a fast pass say at am could result in the fast pass being say pm ticket and in some cases if you go after am may not get a fast pass at all as they would be gone for the whole day for some rides there is the normal line fast pass line and the single rider line which is used to fill in the spare seats on popular rides and i have never seen so many mobility scooters in my life someone told me people hire someone who by law has handicap ticket and a scooter and they use these people to go to front of line for every ride like a vip pass very sad state of affairs food is very expensive in these parks a hotdog which is inches long cost ,4,2016-01-03
3704,Family Vacation,disney security was really good felt like they are on high terror alert very long lines for security bag check long slow lines to enter the park once in it became obvious that the park is extremely over crowded we are packed in like sardines in a can shoulder to shoulder it s extremely unnerving people are pissed off and concerned about what will happen should an emergency happen fast passes for all rides are completely sold out by am so zero chance the kids can ride any of the rides we came here for so we re leaving no longer a fun trip for us headed back to hotel and home in the morning ,1,2015-12-28
3705,"Disney does it right, but timing can make a difference!",okay this is going to be a fairly long review so prepare yourself pros i will preface the review by stating i am a disney fan from there let s discuss the upsides to visiting disneyland there is a huge amount to do in the park though i won t necessarily hit each ride in the park disneyland boasts different park areas as well as main street usa go straight from main street and you will go under the castle before hitting fantasyland keep going from there and you will run into mickey s toon town however if you go right from main street and you will head into tomorrowland left from main street and you can go into either adventureland or frontierland either can then take you into new orlean s square and on to critter country each land tries to have rides or attractions for multiple ages as well as places to grab a bite to eat a major pro is that the food within the park has experienced major upgrades over the past years used to you could only count on chicken fingers pizza hot dogs and burgers today you can find enchiladas chicken salad sandwiches turkey swiss sandwiches burritos roasted chicken hummus and bbq to name just a few however what really impresses me about visiting any disney attraction is how much thought and effort has been invested in the visitor experience in every ride or attraction even the spaces alloted for waiting in line have decorations and visuals designed to make the wait feel very short or not like a wait at all in addition employees of the parks take extreme measures to make visitors feel welcome and give them the best possible experience one easy example is how many creature encounters you see in the park in every land at almost any time of day you will see people in costume prepared to greet visitors and sign autographs additionally the firework displays are especially impressive given they take place every night many years ago disney created the fastpass as a wait to minimize waits for people visitors can go to the fastpass distribution and receive a pass to return later in the day and skip the majority of the lines wait times for a fastpass are usually something like minutes significantly shorter than the standby wait time this solution has evolved over the years as standby wait times and fastpass return times can now be viewed in real time from the disneyland park app smart users will use these to their full advantage cons this kind of entertainment doesn t necessarily come cheap as of dec tickets start at day though that price per day drops as you find specials such as multi day park hoppers local resident prices or purchasing tickets through work corporations to name a few if you drive in traffic within the parking lots can be challenging and you can park so far from the entrance you have to ride a tram to to the entrance you can mitigate that wait by staying on or near property but that location comes at a steep premium there are all kinds of blogs which debate staying on versus near property so i won t cover that instead i will briefly discuss crowds afficianados used to say that there were off seasons and peak seasons however these days many argue there are only peak seasons and high peak seasons so be prepared for significant crowds any time of year the food has improved dramatically over the last decade or two but since you are purchasing food inside a theme park you should expect to pay theme park prices this is southern california so it can be very warm and visitor s should prepare for that i like the fastpass system but disneyworld has gone a step further integrating these electronically into magicbands which can be organized changed and synced with others through the app catch up disneyland tips take a hydration pack for each member of your group and stay hydrated throughout the day winter or summer you will also spend less on drinks inside the park a nice hat can either help keep you warm or keep the sun off of your head and neck stay on or near the park and hit the ground running right when the gates open then depending on your stamina you can go back rest take a quick nap and go back in to shut down the park if you are willing to commit to a multi day park hopper then you can game the fastpass system to an extent you can go to one park do a ride then send runners out with tickets to get a fastpass from first one park then another you cannot have more than one fastpass at a time unless the start time for the firstpass has passed so grab a fastpass for one ride wait in line for another ride then when the fast pass comes up grab a second fastpass before heading to redeem the first fastpass just some ideas ,5,2015-12-28
3706,Love it.,whats not to love about this place you come here expecting to queue and you do not a lot of just standing though as the lines keep moving use the quick pass system where you can this allows you to generate a ticket for a particular ride and give you a time to return and bypass most if not all of the queue the only negative thing i have to say is that there is not a decent coffee to be found in the place please america understand that not every one drinks filter coffee stay for the parade if you can as it is great and use the railway to quickly move around the park to the area you want particularly tomorrowland which is very busy at the moment due to all the starwars happenings ,5,2015-12-27
3707,7th Visit,i love disneyland we visited years in a row taking of our children each time september is pretty quiet with very little line ups for the rides weather was fantastic we brought in our own water and filled up our bottles at the many water stations also packed our own food ,5,2015-12-27
3708,Christmas Visit,growing up in orlando i ve gone to disney world a trillion times but have never visited disneyland my husband and i spent christmas day at the park and couldn t have had a better time most lines were minutes some of the more popular rides had significantly longer wait times i proudly wore my first visit button and employees seemed to light up and want to tell us something special about the park as we were waiting for our car to pick us up an employee was leaving for the day she saw my button and gave me a special christmas button it was so thoughtful loved the nemo submarine and haunted mansion and of course the star wars rides ,5,2015-12-27
3709,AWESOME!!!!,this place is huge and beautiful the castle at this time is decorated with diamonds unfortunately the fireworks were canceled but i went to the lands the were all great but my two favorites are tomorrow land and fantasyland paint the park was beautiful with great lights fantasia tic was breathtaking mickey was beautiful and was talented fireworks fit well you have to go to this awesome place ,5,2015-12-25
3710,Birthday at Disneyland,what a wonderful time we had we found fun things to do out of the ordinary like the play aladdin and waiting in line to see santa and then there was finding all the th anniversary penny smashing machines in the park the parades were fantastic the christmas one was great with everything decorated for the holiday then there was paint the night spectacular the fireworks and all the different projections on the buildings on main street and the castle really includes the audience in the program also the new star wars section that s not the name but it was definitely all changed to reflect the movies and meeting darth vader and chewie totally made the trip and the new galactic grill awesome i could go on and on i had a wonderful time can t wait to go back,5,2015-12-25
3711,They are taking us for granted!,the park is charging way to much for the entertainment that they provide my last trip to disneyland park was lackluster to say the least crowded crowded crowded park is riding on it s past reputation and has not kept up with new innovation the price of food is ridiculous and the waiting time for a ride is insane customer service is nonexistent i will need to wait several years before i forget my last visit i will say the unspeakable it sucks ,2,2015-12-14
3712,Local crowd taking away Disney Magic.,i want to start by saying we are huge disney fans with probably around trips to disneyland alone starting back in the s and going every years we like to go big with all trips being over days so that we can take our time and experience everything this is the first time i have ever left somewhat disappointed we all felt that a lot of the touches that made disney magical have left which sucked to see the first thing that got to us was the crowd for it to be the second week in december we were amazed at how many people flooded the parks but after some observations it became apparent that the large influx of people was from the local socal area the socal annual passes start around a year the same price everyone who travels spends on days so those of us buying plane tickets paying for hotels have to pay full price on tickets while k local teenagers being aggressive and paying nearly nothing get to clog the lines because they live nearby first hit against disney over the years we have made traditions of places we like to stop at and eat on mainstream and what not unfortunately disney has sold out to starbucks and now all the things millions of people loved are no longer available instead you get the same thing you can get on any corner in the world not very magical strike two we understand that things happen anytime technology is involved so a closure or delay here or there isn t a big deal but when different rides go down over and over extending your line time by a half hour each time you lose out on your trip plus the lack of maintenance was insane going through splash mtn was laughable at least different sets of animatronics were broken multiple lights were burnt out leaving the display in darkness and speakers did not work throughout other rides had similar problems and we saw these on the first and last days there but honestly all of that i could live with it was the cast members that really got to us the older cms were great everything you would expect but the younger generation was horrible more involved in their sidebar conversations than the guests not smiling looking annoyed when asked questions etc one or two can happen but it was such a regular occurrence that we all took notice and no one was pleased now the good at the end of the day once on the ride they are still a blast the new radiator springs is great the revamp of caldis is a great improvement the shows did not disappoint either we still had a great time but the immediate decision was we will stick to disney world in the future it may be the international fan base but the magic is still full strength at the lands younger bigger brother ,3,2015-12-13
3713,It's a whole new world!,we hadn t been there since our older son was and this time we took his and year olds wow what a difference it s bright and inviting and so expanded plenty of great rides places to eat hungry bear is fast and good and throngs of people if you can afford it hire a non affiliated disneyland guide we saw attractions in the time it would have taken to see maybe without the guide the guide took all the stress out of finding our way around with our noses in a map finding and getting into places to eat waiting in lines maybe minutes instead of minutes to over hours and dealing with children who do not have much patience for long lines who would the lines were ridiculous i know it sounds bratty to get a guide but what a gift they were and they did more for you than the vip disneyland guide who was three times or more the money don t miss the pm parade it s truly grand as are the fireworks if you have a tag team guiding service they can save you a bench for the parade people start lining up hours in advance spent two full days in the park my fit bit said i walked steps so wear very comfortable shoes a grand days oh find giradelli s chocolate shop and try the hot chocolate ,5,2015-12-02
3714,Magical Visit!,this place is the best disney by far main street is just gorgeous and the th celebration over lay is stunning the castle looks so beautiful ,5,2015-12-01
3715,Carousel of Possible Dreams,i joined a group from my favorite charity assistance league of newport mesa and rode the carousel early before the park opened this was to benefit another great community support group festival of children not only did we ride the lovely carousel but we went on mr toad s wild ride peter pan and the mad hatter tea cup ride it proves that there is a kid in all of us regardless of age disneyland is a place where anyone can experience pure bliss and leave troubles at the gate the staff was so very efficient and hospitable what a wonderful opportunity to revisit childhood memories ,5,2015-11-27
3716,DISNEYLAND!! NO PLACE CAN BEAT IT FOR ENTERTAINMENT VALUE,what more can be said about disneyland that has not already been said the happiest place on earth we spent two days here one day in california adventure and one day at disneyland midweek not during vacation time was great no large crowds or long waits for the attractions the weather was perfect mid s at california adventure the cars rides were fun and the toy story midway game was new and worth doing the live shows were entertaining as was the world of color water show after dark disneyland was charming as it was decorated for christmas we were able to walk aright in maybe minutes in line for indiana jones pirates haunted mansion and jungle boat cruise the live show at the horse shoe theater is entertaining small world buzz lightyear finding nemo sub ride star tours get a fast pass as it often has a longer line and the christmas parade is well done we have visited so many times had season passes when our son was growing up and it is always such a nice place to spend the day even as empty nesters clean safe well maintained and a great value for a full days entertainment you just never get tired of visiting and going on the rides which you have been on many many times it is still a treat ,5,2015-11-25
3717,The Christmas decorations are truly magical,we went the day after they put up the christmas decorations and it was truly magical they made it snow ,5,2015-11-20

3719,Felt like a kid again!,with just one day we stuck to disneyland park and that was a good decision the rides are great nothing crazy scary like other theme parks so i had a ball and got to join in as i m not an thrill seeker when it comes to this sort of thing i thought it was a bit twee very old fashioned and proper but fantastic at the same time if that makes sense i was surprised at all the dressed up little girls and bigger girls no matter what the age of the females were dressed up or at least wore a version of minnie s ears very cute in nz i doubt that many kids would have a clue about the traditional disney characters so it was interesting that the park focus was very much these old guys picked up a good hint on trip advisor about going back to the car parking building to watch the fireworks a great idea we weren t the only ones but very sensible unfortunately the fireworks hadn t happened hour after they were meant to have started so we ended up heading out without seeing them which was really disappointing plan ahead work out what you want to do and how best to see everything extremely disappointing was the cost of merchandise absolutely over the top i was shocked and decided my grandson wouldn t be getting a souvineer from here a wonderful attraction but man they milk you at every turn really greedy in my opinion ,5,2015-11-11
3720,Disappointing Halloween Weekend,we were excited to be at disneyland over halloween weekend and looked forward to the decorations and excitement we have never been during a peak season it certainly was eye opening first of all we got day park hopper tickets and because they were day we all had to have our picture taken why well the cast member recited his lines perfectly about how it was to protect us in case we lost our tickets and someone else tried to use them really i said so if we lose our tickets do you invalidate them and issue new ones no this conversation went around in circles for about minutes until i finally got him to admit that the real reason they must take your picture is to make sure you don t give sell your ticket to someone else nice btw you have no choice you must have your picture taken or they will not allow you in each person is linked to a ticket yes even the kids and when you re enter be sure you have the right person with the right ticket or you won t get in lines were outrageous and people working were crabby and generally unfriendly indiana jones ride broke twice in the same day space mountain also broke down tomorrowland future building is closed for a year to renovate it fastpass tickets were a joke more so if you get a fastpass for certain rides you cannot get one for a different ride until you actually use the first one such as space mtn and the star wars d ride i guess the most upsetting thing was how dirty the park was we have been here times over the past years and it has never been dirty never there were always people cleaning with rags sweeping etc there were papers food gum all kinds of things all over the park and we only saw one person in the two days we were there that was sweeping very disappointing walt would be ashamed we were travelling with grandparents in their s and at one point they just could not walk anymore they showed their handicapped state issues cards to access the haunted mansion and it took people to come over and be both rude and uncompassionate to tell them they had to walk all the way back to the front to the main building to get a pass they issues a fastpass and said to return in an hour but it was apparently a big inconvenience for them the next day they went directly to the main building to get a pass they were told that unless they rented a wheel chair they could not be assisted more so they were told by a cast member that it was a park and you should expect to walk around a lot and wait on line if you are here nice very nice luckily we were with them and the grandkids had us to run around with them but tell me does this mean that grandparents are no longer welcome into disneyland with their grandchildren unless the kids regardless of age push the grandparents around in wheel chairs completely unacceptable i do realize that people abused the privilege and were hiring people to go to disneyland with them to get line passes but please these people are in their mids this wasn t a joke shame on disney i guess like all things it has become completely and totally commercialized and the care and interest in making it a fun family friendly clean experience has passed it s a business and it has succumbed to the make money no matter what it takes mentality sad thing we were treated better and enjoyed knotts berry farm more now that says a lot ,2,2015-11-09
3721,Returned for Park's 60th Celebration,we frequent the disney parks in florida much more frequently than the ones in california but had to make the trip west for the anniversary celebration the last time we were in disneyland was for the th anniversary and not much has changed as far as attractions more has changed in california adventure separate review our plan was to spend an entire day at disneyland another at california adventure and the third a combo of the two covering the attractions missed on the first two days most disney fans upon arrival at the destination city would go to the main park first disneyland in anaheim and magic kingdom in orlando we thought the same but made the mistake of making our first day a saturday when planning this trip i knew the may be more crowded than usual this year because of the anniversary as well as the halloween season but i had no idea that my weekend days would include a themed weekend which would draw even more people than a regular weekend the crowds turned out to be almost unbearable it was comparable to the florida parks in the summer without the heat which we always avoid after experiencing it as a result of the crowds we accomplished less than half of what we usually do in a full autumn day from early morning to late night as a result we had to revise some of our plans and only concentrate on the must dos which was seeing the attractions specifically presented for the anniversary year and going on rides not available in florida this included the parades shows and fireworks which take up a lot of time since people claim their viewing spaces hours before the actual show parade we worked the meals and rides around the scheduled times of the shows and parades our day ended up seeing the disneyland band at the main street firehouse show with chip dale and goofy the laughing stock company at the golden horseshoe the frozen show at the royal theatre and the mickey and the magical map at the fantasyland theatre for rides we rode the main street omnibus roger rabbit s car toon spin fastpass and the casey jr circus train all not in florida after dinner we saw the fantasmic show with a fastpass obtained early in the morning and paint the night the disneyland forever fireworks was cancelled due to high winds so we had to save that for the final night we also couldn t fit in the afternoon soundsational parade so we left that for the final half day for meals we managed to get into caf orleans top on our list for their famous monte cristo and for dinner we had a reservation at the carnation caf both restaurants will be reviewed separately we spent a bit of time in toontown since it doesn t exist in florida the only negatives to this trip were a direct result of the crowds on the first day there was miscommunication on the restaurant lines and no communication in the fantasmic viewing areas the viewing areas were chaotic and each employee was herding the crowds in different ways we got there more than an hour ahead of the show time with our fastpass and were directed to our area only to be moved after we found our front viewing spot there were just too many people in the viewing areas and we re thankful there were no emergencies since we were packed like sardines all s well that ends well since it turned out to be a great show but as a result of this experience we decided to do a non park day on the next day sunday and continue on to california adventure on monday on our final day tuesday we hopped to disneyland in time to see the afternoon soundsational parade which we missed the first day we also rode small world which of course is in florida but it s a must for every disney fan on each trip we had a fastpass for the holiday haunted mansion and did that before dinner at the french market and dessert at the stage door caf we had time for a ride on the mark twain riverboat at night which we never did before the disneyland forever fireworks a great way to end the trip this last day was so much more enjoyable than the weekend crowded day as disney enthusiasts know advanced planning is advised to get the most for your money since the parades and shows happen at different times each day of the week get a schedule online preferred or as you enter each park so you can work your itinerary around the scheduled performances if they are on your must do list if you re just going to do rides then you have more flexibility just remember to get your fastpasses tip you can get a fastpass for a ride in addition to a fastpass for a show ,4,2015-11-08
3722,It's Disneyland ... Whats not to like,with the exception of the cost involved it is clean and several different ways to have fun some is dated but i must say some of the classic events and rides are still the best ,5,2015-11-08
3723,Love this place,honestly disneyland is such a fun place to visit especially with families it does not lack in fun and excitement and all the thought that must go in to making this park work so well does not go un noticed by me we have been bringing our kids here for years and even as they have grown older the idea of a visit to disneyland is always sure to bring lots of smiles to their faces ,5,2015-11-08
3724,Fun and crazy,just took our young children all under the age of to disney we had a three day park hopper which was more than enough time for us we did disney on our st day got there early which i strongly suggest unfortunately it was a saturday do not go on a saturday had a great morning but park was overwhelming by noon second day spent in ca we had a fantastic day way shorter lines and we planned our day around fast passes and took advantage of the switch pass only complaint if you want to eat in a sit down restaurant make reservations way ahead everything was always booked frustrating but the food we did have was great try a giant turkey leg that s a meal right there rd and last day headed back to finish disney better day not so many locals less busy for the st half of day took our yr old daughter to the bibidi bobidi boutique she had a makeover and got a princess dress it s expensive but she loved it and is a great memory second part of day no good we had collected fast passes to some of our favorite rides went to use them both were broken down they said they would be up in an hr went back they were closed so missed out on great rides the park closed really early pm for the halloween party but really everything started shutting down at so we paid full price for a much shorter day we didn t pay extra for the party as it would have been another each so we left at and went back to ca actually enjoyed myself more there this time again tried to eat out at a lovely looking restaurant which looked empty but supposedly was fully booked anyways i love disney and my kids did too of course we will go back oh one more thing in ca the water in the fake ocean was dirty had a tone of garbage in it not very disney i want the magic i certainly paid for it ,4,2015-11-05
3725,Hey! It's Disneyland!,sure it s crowded and expensive but it s somewhere you should take the kids if you can i ve been there with just adults and i ve been there with young children way more fun with young ones the awe on their face is priceless ,5,2015-11-04
3726,Disneyland VIP Experience. Both Parks.,coming all the way from australia and only having one day to spare i booked the disney vip experience i m not going to lie it was deathly expensive but i saved up for months and i m so pleased i did our guide for the day amy was terrific we didn t have to try to find our way around the parks we went to rides in both parks one day and we had front of the line access there was still a slight wait on some of the more popular rides but nothing like what we would have had to endure on our own if you have a bad back like i do or don t want to wait for hours with children then this is worth it i looked at it like this you can do all the rides you want to do in one day and pay for the vip privilege or you can spend days there to complete the same itinerary that s further accommodation costs food drinks and a lot of waiting in line the vip experience also gives you first class access to sectioned off areas for events we had an awesome view for the parades and fireworks and the place was packed without these areas we would have been rows deep in people and would have seen nothing the costs are a lot lower if you divide the total between people that is the maximum in one group you pay the same for one person or ten pay by the hour so get a group together divide the costs and go vip it s the only way you will get value for your disneyland day tips book a long time in advance this gives you time to organize your itinerary it s amazing how that will change keep the children in your group around the same age this way your group will remain relatively harmonious also be mindful that girls will want to do some things and boy another so try to have a group that likes mostly the same things you can do individual thing before or after you meet up with your vip host stick to your itinerary once you get there if you have a heap of people all wanting to do different things then it wastes time and you are paying by the hour you must pay a minimum of hours so start at lunch time after lunch it got a lot busier and that was when that front of line access was awesome don t waste time eating you can meet your vip tour guide at the restaurant of your choice so have a good lunch then something light on the go during the tour this makes the most of your time this is worth it it makes the day a pleasure and means that while the crowds are all around you you are not a part of it we also had front of the ride access so the kids got to be right where the action was every ride ,5,2015-11-04
3727,Expected More,i went on a tuesday morning and it was not very busy so a great time to go a lot of effort was put into the theme of the rides but the rides were poor aimed more at young children i was disappointed as it is not cheap entry at per person as it was not very busy when i was there i was able to do the whole park in a little over hours also the food outlets were terrible and horrendously overpriced as is to be expected at these attractions,2,2015-11-02
3728,This review is for Disneyland Park only,so the last time i came to disneyland park was nearly years ago and have fond memories of the place much has changed since then and i decided to come again the day before halloween perhaps that was my biggest mistake we arrived at pm and it was unbelievably crowded judging from the research i ve done after the visit i guess this park attracts more locals and it seemed that way wait times were at least minutes all around and fast passes were hours and desperate to just get out of one area we decided to brave a minute wait for a specific ride indie jones now granted the line does move so you re not really standing still for a long period of time that i have to give them credit for doing a good job so the above mentioned are things neither i nor disney have much control over apart from when i choose to visit here is what i was disappointed about i understand that rides get updated but there were a couple of updates that detracted from the rides indiana jones i remember there used to be a boulder rolling towards us in the end and the train would seem to hurtle towards it before dropping and that was the end of the ride now no boulder but you still have indie hanging from up there and i didn t understand a word he said very anti climactic haunted mansion has gone completely tim burton s nightmare before christmas now and towards the end there used to be a holographic mirror you went by and there would be a ghoul or grizzly seated beside you now i had a roll of christmas wrapping paper someone else had dr zeuss hat what the employees were sour whatever happened to the happiest place on earth you d think they were working in the most miserable place on earth they were not of good cheer friendly they were chatting amongst themselves and herding cattle speaking of herding cattle hey at least entertain us while we re waiting in line especially when the waits get pretty up there like minutes long a person or two coming out to entertain or talk to us in character of the ride would work i think club med does a better job at that i kinda feel like i dealt with a bad pimp during my visit they took my money under delivered and didn t care about my experience now i ve never been to a pimp but i m just saying we did have reservations at the blue bayou for lunch and that was good no complaints there but after hours we still had not finished our rides in adventureland and critter country and the riff raft was ballooning i threw in the towel and headed back to the hotel for a glass of champagne instead maybe i ll try again on a rainy weekday in january away from any holidays or events ,2,2015-11-01
3729,Don't waste your time on a weekend,we went on a saturday in october the only day we had free to go it was so packed we could hardly move wait times for the popular rides were two hours long fastpass distribution closed early we went back to splash mountain in our return window to use the one fastpass we did get only to find the ride was closed due to mechanical issues we did finally get on later traffic was herded one way after shows meaning even if you hadn t watched a show you had to go that one way which was usually the opposite direction you were trying to go to get to a ride and we didn t see any characters walking around we even dedicated time to go to toontown only to find there were minute waits to meet mickey and minnie my year old niece left disneyland disappointed with an empty autograph book she had bought with her own money overall the experience was not enjoyable and was a letdown we had traveled all the way from canada with an unfavorable exchange rate just to be stuck in crowds and herded like cattle disneyland lets way too many people in to the point guests hardly get to see and do what they were excited for walt would be aghast haha we did finally get on some of the rides we wanted to late at night and they were fun and slightly redeemed the park s image that is the only reason i m giving disneyland a three instead of a two ,3,2015-10-29
3730,Not the house Walt built,i have been to disneyland more times than i can count yes beginning years ago shortly after it opened to celebrate my rd birthday i want to make my perspective clear we have held annual passports times once as a couple and twice for our entire family of eight we have had many wonderful experiences here it is still clean as a whistle the rides are fun the employees friendly the food is great in some venues so so in others so why stars the price of admission has continued to skyrocket and what you receive for what you pay has become less and less one of our daughters a season pass holder until a month ago has not renewed because the price went up and they took away her parking pass and added restricted weeks it has become incredibly difficult for a family to afford admission at over for one day in one park plus for parking food prices continue to rise as well it is crowded even in late oct on a tuesday etc etc the shops lost their uniqueness years ago it used to be that the things you bought in one area were not in another they were individual to that land not anymore it has become very obvious that disneyland is now all about how much money they can make at what price will people stop coming the great entertainers are gone no more billy hill hardly any live entertainment sad very sad that said shoot me i still love the place ,4,2015-10-26
3731,Still crowded on a Tuesday in mid-October!,the attractions are aging the park fees keep increasing the lines are still long the food vendors are limited and i cannot agree that it s the happiest place on earth the only highlights are the nightly parade of lights and fireworks show we were there on a tuesday to try and avoid the crowds but seems like everyone else had the same idea we chose oct th out of necessity since we had no desire to visit the park on any of the halloween nights which costs an extra per person just for an evening session anyway lesson learned ,3,2015-10-26
3732,don't do it to yourself go to universal studios!!!,i wouldn t recommend going to disney unless you have kids under the inch height or if you love queuing up for over a hour and half disney doesn t seem to have a shut of point of how many people they let in apparently we went on a quiet day when ques where still so long we had the day park pass and did the california adventure park which was okay not as busy as the disney land park we just left after being in the park for an hour as i think queuing up for over an hour is a waste of time even doing the fast passes didnt get you in any quicker and you only really makes you cut of the line even the ques for food and drink lines were ridiculously long i would not recommend going to disneyland and think there are far better parks out there the rides need updating as there old and obsolete a lot of the rides are not disney based which you would expect to see in a disney park this was by far the worst theme park i have ever been to ,1,2015-10-26
3733,Happiest Place Still?,thought we could sneak in on an off tuesday evening in october for a nice evening arrived around pm and found lines at the parking garage first strike at the security line they were searching ladies purses i walked past and had a female cast member start yelling at me that i needed to get back in line i pointed out that did not have a purse i m a male she continued to yell at me even after i had gotten back in line we paid the entire daily admission per person for just hours but we knew that for the start the place was packed it seemed like there was a large number of people leaving but just about the same number arriving all of the fast passes were already taken and the booths were closed wait times river cruise minutes haunted mansion minutes this ride kept breaking down pirates of the caribbean minutes space mountain minutes long lines at all of the restaurants and you could barely walk without running into the crowds around pm we were able to get close to a restaurant and had a very nice sit down dinner close time was pm and the crowds never died down orlando is so much bigger and they seem to do a much better job of crowd control ,3,2015-10-25
3734,Fun,great escape you can get lost in this place don t just focus on the rides lots of entertainment and sightseeing too ,5,2015-10-24
3735,Too crowded and charged full price for not a full day,what made me mad was we normally leave during the afternoon crowds and come back around pm but couldn t there was a special event halloween party thus we couldn t do that also it was so crowded that we only spent a single day in the park and found other free stuff to do around la instead like going to the beach as disneyland closed early there were no fastpasses available during the afternoon so we ended standing in huge lines what a waste of time and we ll not be coming back anytime soon disneyland is packing in huge crowds so i m sure they could care less ,2,2015-10-23
3736,Disney Halloween Experience,disney is celebrating turning this year and my friend and i were celebrating turning so we decided to go to disneyland and celebrate with mickey et al this trip was booked by my friend who knowing i am a huge fan of halloween thought this would be the perfect time to visit the park it was my third trip to disneyland and yes the changes to the park attire of the characters for halloween was interesting to see i expected even more from disney though i hoped for just over the top halloween we booked and paid more to also do a hour halloween haunts walking tour which in my opinion on a scale of was a it wasn t spooky at all nothing seemed overly halloweenish or haunted and it just meant travelling through a crowded disneyland with additional people to try to not lose in the crowd the pro s to the tour were getting to the front of the line for the rides on the tour and trick or treating at two stops along the way but i wouldn t say worth the price disneyland is very expensive i still can t figure out why they charge an additional dollars to have the park hopping pleasure the are right next door to each other and should be opened up and covered under one price in my opinion also in my opinion disney should offer discounted rates for people coming just for the evening portion things i liked the disney castle was even more beautiful than usual as it was bejewelled and sparkly for disney s diamond anniversary i never ever get tired of seeing any of the disney characters and giving them a big hug getting my picture taken with them the mickey mouse head ice cream bars are most delicious well that s about it for my review i am sure i ll be back again some day ,4,2015-10-22
3737,As always an enjoyable visit,i think walt disney would roll over in his grave if he knew how expensive they have made everything i got two bags of carmel corn and paid a wee bit high don t you think with the increase in gate admission a family has to save for awhile to even visit for a day we also attended a day that they had the halloween fright night and had to leave at pm we knew before hand but i am sure some families were disappointed no fireworks or evening parade no discounts either it has become a greedy business ,4,2015-10-21
3738,Disneyland in the Fall,my boyfriend and i visited disneyland yesterday for my first time as a part of our california adventure road trip i was really excited to experience the magic of disneyland we chose a tuesday in october hoping to avoid big crowds that did not happen the park was extremely crowded but disneyland staff handled it with professionalism we were impressed we really liked the fast pass system recommend it as adults traveling without children we questioned the logic of parents taking kiddos under we saw a lot of crying kids frustrated stressed parents as for the happiest place on earth we saw very few smiles and we were caught off guard by that we really enjoyed riding space mountain pirates of the caribbean and indiana jones the most we waited the longest for the haunted house that had been decorated in nightmare before christmas with added touches for halloween it was the biggest ride let down very lame we ended our day with a train ride around the park and really enjoyed it disneyland all lit up at night is beautiful we enjoyed the fireworks from our hotel pool away from the crowds ,3,2015-10-21
3739,Wow,the lines are long too long for little kids too many people in the park to move with a stroller and this is off season looking at the adults faces around me very few are smiling day of our day park hopper tickets due to long wait lines we only rode ride all day we had special event tickets for trick or treat with mickey for a different day while the actual trick or treat was done quite well we took advantage of the lack of lines for the rides and managed to get on some with very little wait then this is not the disneyland of the past we will not be back ,3,2015-10-21
3740,Crowded,difficulty walking through the park due to large crowds and long wait times for most rides spoilt what may have been a good day i have experienced better times at the other disney parks fastpass not the easiest to use here ,3,2015-10-21
3741,One of Our Favorite Places!,disneyland is everything everyone says it is crowded but most certainly worth the time in line the park is a model of efficiency from the parking structure to the trams to the lines for rides try to go during the week and plan to stay all day there are some less expensive restaurants about a minute walk from the park that are worth walking to cocos tiffy s and don t forget california adventure if you have a park hopper pass tip get the fast pass for popular rides hardly any waiting in line and download an app that gives you ride wait times it helps ,4,2015-10-20
3742,"Prive keeps going up, people keep crowding in, we have noticed maintanance issues sliding.",the park cost an arm and a leg and another arm worst day was last saturday the lines for rides were blocking the means of walking around the park the fire department would shut them down if they saw the ciaos employees are all about the rules ask for a request and most will not treat you very nice they might meet your needs but very abruptly rules are rules you should have seen the signs in the parking garages and buses well not if you took uber to the park ok experience but it is getting worse and worse and less enjoyable i need to go back during the super bowl when no one else is there california resident passes should be more money why should it be cheaper for them to crowd the park than anyone else not a fun time still got to take the grandkids when the grandkids want to go ,3,2015-10-20
3743,Once only visit,i grew up seeing disneyland in movies and dreamed of one day visiting well i finally got there but was so disappointed it was crowded hot expensive and the long waiting times on rides was beyond ridiculous i was lucky to be on my own and saved time not having to wait for rides as i could go on as a single rider if it wasn t for this i think you would only fit several rides into a day definitely not a day trip but i wouldn t want to waste two or three days waiting in queues food was expensive and not that appetising i m glad i got to see it but definitely wouldn t rush back ,4,2015-10-20
3744,The Happiest Place on Earth,my four kids and i have had the pleasure of having disneyland in our own backyard we are minutes down the freeway from disney and have been enjoying it for years now my top five insider tips about disneyland the week after labor day weekend is the least crowded it s the week all the kids go back to school i let my kids play hooky that week every year and we go for the day we literally walk on all the rides christmas time at disneyland its the best they don t leave one detail out its magical especially at night all the decorations are up before thanksgiving the week before thanksgiving during the week it is not crowded this is a strange one but its at the top of my list the small bathrooms at the tiki room are the cleanest and the least crowded they are at the top of the stairs just before the entrance to the tiki room on the left eating at the blue bayou restaurant on a super hot day i have only eaten there once it was really hot out and the restaurant is dark and has cool air atmosphere fun and calming good food the corn dog cart it is at the end of main street just before the entrance to tomorrowland the best corn dogs i have ever had i hope you get to enjoy a trip there ,5,2015-10-16
3745,Magical,this is obviously a place everyone on earth should go to i have been several times and am never tired to see everything it doesn t matter what age you are there is something for everyone ,5,2015-10-13
3746,Disneyland Rules!!!,spent days on a multi pass with california adventure grandparents daughter and year old grandson musts fantasia fireworks paint the night and all the rides you can fit in walt disney had amazing foresight to creat such an amazing experience much fun for young and not so young magic magic ,5,2015-10-11
3747,Shut at 7pm,i m on a short trip to america and scheduled my first ever visit to disneyland upon getting there we were informed the park would shut at to make way for mickeys halloween party with two days left in the usa it was unfortunately my last opportunity to visit weekends are not an option as the crowds would be horrific i was gutted because i had been told the night time is the best part of the day due to lights shows and the magical atmosphere i was even more unimpressed that the ticket price hadn t been reduced to allow for the allow closure is pretty steep for a half job in the park itself it is a magical day and great to be surrounded by such happiness however the queues are ridiculously long and sometimes lacking in shade disabled people get to queue jump which i also strongly disagree with as they ride their mobility scooters then get up and easily walk to the ride i don t see the problem with riding the scooter through the ordinary line most rides had a half an hour or so wait and more time is spent getting on and off the rides than actually enjoying them when pm came around we got off the nemo ride and wanted to grab a drink on our way out the staff member was quite rude and ushered us on our way the same happened when i tried to take a picture of the castle lit up at night obviously disneyland is something everybody should enjoy once in their life but it is stupidly expensive for what it is and my own personal experience was ruined by poor timing in future they should consider keeping half of the park open for public use and closing half for the private functions ,3,2015-10-10
3748,Disneyland with my grandson,i have been to disney world well over times and i always enjoyed it disneyland with my grandson sebastian who is years was really special normally you would think that going to an amusement park with a year old might be a hassle but he was great we went on rides and he was laughing all the way they were all of my favorites he got to meet mickey donald and goofy and was thrilled maybe i should say that i was also thrilled the weather was perfect and we ate everything in sight including my favorite a mickey bar all i can say is you re never to young or to old to go to disneyland ,5,2015-10-08
3749,Amazing experience,amazing an example of how to do hospitality at the highest loved have to go back kids wife and i loved it clean secure friendly food a bit pricey but it is disneyland but the quality is good,4,2015-10-07
3750,Classic Disney,the day after we did universal studios hollywood my wife and i did the disneyland experience it was quite the day first of all disney ain t cheap we bought day park hopper tickets which means we had access to both parks on site disneyland and disney california it s for the regular day pass and another or so for the park hopper upgrade so after all that for two we paid about just for our admission we also had food and drink onsite which is of course also very expensive relative to the out of park options the only other negative was the huge crowds on a tuesday in october which of course are uncontrollable we knew we d be paying a pretty penny for disney though so we can t fault them for either of the above the nice thing about paying top dollar for a theme park experience is that it s consistently amazing everything was dialed in and even with the huge and unexpected crowds we were able to move through the park relatively easy and hit pretty much all of the popular rides disney is great at traffic management and moving people through the attraction lines quickly they also have really nice theming to watch or interact with while you wait on average we probably waited between and minutes for most rides and the longest was the last of the night space mountain at about minutes that was tough my favorite ride was soarin over california in the disney california park it really makes you feel like you re flying through the air over the california countryside the roller coaster california screamin was awesome too and had a pretty short wait time for the volume of people waiting for it the themed rides in the regular park were great too we were also able to see kind of forced to see due to the crowds the parade at night and fireworks which were a delightful surprise i highly recommend the parade our disney experience was just as magical as we could have hoped for even with the huge crowds we ll be back as soon as we can ,5,2015-10-07
3751,The original & the best Disney Park,i have made ten seperate trips to disneyland from australia since i love this theme park it is the bench mark that all theme parks try to compete against disneyland is an example of how a great theme park should be fun for all ages not just kids disneyland will bring your childhood to life it has rides shows restaurants that will amaze you keep you coming back for more but be sure that you allow at least three days to comfortably see all that this park has to offer ,5,2015-10-07
3752,Great family bucket list item,this was our first trip to a disney park and we had a blast we got a three day parkhopper and split time between here and california adventure we had a great time at both but for me disneyland was more about the nostalgia i got goosebumps seeing all the rides and sites like the castle that i grew up watching on tv we rode all the original rides and enjoyed some of the new attractions too it could use some updating in places but overall it s a great place to visit the crowds were not too bad unless you want to see the parade they tell you to line up something like hours early because people start getting spots along the route at that time we opted out and did not see the fireworks over the castle but i did go in to take pics of the castle lit up at night afterward and it was an awesome site we used the fastpasses for pretty much anything we could at both parks and those are great i would love to go back to see the halloween or christmas decorations one of these days ,5,2015-10-06
3753,Always a good time,love this time of year every one is very accomidating a little busy but still a good time if you take your time ,5,2015-10-05
3754,Holding on - youngs won't notice magic is disappearing. But it is.,holding on to what they can as the operations get away from them traffic patterns onto disneyland drive totally unacceptable victims of their own success i think i did appreciate the ability to do a fast pass for the rides with insane wait times an excellent system some attractions really need updates yes tiki room i m talking to you lots of things down for refurbishment at tomorrowland place has serious deferred maintenance issues but they can make up for it with staff quality and there are lots of good ones and too many surly ones for a place like disney they are holding on but not likely to return for a good long while and it won t hurt their bottom line ,4,2015-10-04
3755,Magical experience,a trip to disneyland is never going to be a budget family experience but it is certainly one that will create memories for a lifetime all of the cast members they don t have staff are there to make your experience has happy as possible even the sweepers stopped and offered to take pictures for us so we could get the whole family in and you won t see trash anywhere we discovered a few secrets which made the visit extra special ask for a complimentary map on the jungle cruise for a special souvenir get the kids to ask if they can wake up jose in the enchanted tiki room ask if you can go into the wheelhouse on the paddle steamer make good use of the fast passes and head to popular rides early and you ll get to do everything in days and have a ball ,5,2015-10-02
3756,Disappointed,overpriced for what you get nothing but stores to spend money in they should include both parks for the price of one i feel sorry for family with kids,3,2015-10-01
3757,It's Disney!!,hard to have a bad review of the happiest place on earth we were there on a day that the park closed early due to mickey s halloween party however we managed to make it through the entire park and see just about everything in one day it s not to be missed even if your kids aren t with you it s just as much fun for adults as it is for kiddos,5,2015-09-30
3758,Everything we wanted and more!,i don t really know what more can be said about disneyland it was truly a magical experience for my family we had a day park hopper i feel this was perfect we never felt rushed but we were there from open till close every day it was unseasonably hot when we visited but we just made use of the rides with good airconditioning and dole whip became a family favourite i think we made good use of the fast passes we had planned our visit to coincide with a quieter period after labor day and visited mid week but it s always nice to lessen the wait time the longest wait we had without a fast pass was about minutes the cast members are just so lovely and it s worth doing some research about little things they can do to help make your visit even more special my kids loved exchanging pins my kids loved chatting to the people this led us to meet and good manners go a long way food isn t cheap but we didn t feel it was too expensive either we took snacks to eat when in the queues and packed lunch once or twice but we also found that many meals are plenty big enough to share stage door cafe does a fish and chips that was more than enough for both my boys and we were quite surprised with the healthy options around the place kids meals are usually offered with carrots or apple slices etc necessarily we saved and planned for a long time to make our holiday happen i m so glad we did we d be back tomorrow if we could be ,5,2015-09-30
3759,disappointed,my favorite ride the pirates of the caribbean is closed for refurbishment but will re open on i was a little disappointed but made the best of everything we could get on ,5,2015-09-24
3760,"Labor Day Week...HOT, HOT, HOT,",i ve been lucky enough to visit disneyland a dozen or so times throughout my years i love it and i would be an annual pass holder if i lived in california we arrived on labor day to a pretty busy park and pretty lengthy wait times and to degrees labor day was the only day of our trip that fantasmic was showing so we did the dinner package at the river belle terrace i highly recommend this option we chose to travel the week of labor day expecting smaller crowds a website even suggested that our travel dates would be ghost town dates not so much we were at disney september m f with park hopper tickets as the week went on the crowds did decrease and strangely enough friday was the least crowded day there was a bit of a heat wave temps were just about or just over degrees for our entire visit i was so thankful that i had read on tripadvisor that you can ask for a cup of water at any of the walk up food counters we did this several times but we also started the day wilth a bottle of water that we brought into the park with us and we purchased several bottles of water at the parks as well you really notice the lack of shade in many of the line ques when the sun is so hot be aware we did notice a lot of people using umbrellas to shade themselves misters would have been so welcomed it s a small world is a great ride to escape the heat but once the ride is over you sit in the full sun as you wait to get off of the ride another tip i read is that you can view the parade in front of its a small world yep it s true we watched both the day time and night time parades from here we also discovered that you can view the fireworks from new orleans square traveling the week of labor day was visually fun as well as every day the park seemed to receive a new touch of fall decorations over night the haunted mansion opened with it s haloween overlay the last day of our trip super busy attraction but they added a fast pass to it on this trip we also discovered how gluten free friendly the parks have become ask for an allergy menu at any of the resturants for options not only gluten free but dairy free and egg free well that s all i can think of for now we have now visited during record rainfall earthquakes and triple digit weather you never know what you re going to get but chances are with a positive attitude and a bit of planning your visit is sure to be magical ,5,2015-09-23
3761,The Original and still great.. Try and Get here for the Halloween Celebrations,second visit in three years my year old son and i s avourite was star tours the jedi training academy space mountain the haunted mansion raiders of the lost arc my wife and i got soaked on splash mountain heaps of great stuff to do here and we found a french restaurant by the new orleans themed area very good value with a healthy option available for health conscious folk being an aussie i m still fascinated by mac cheese great day out heaps to do and despite huge queues and thousands of people everyone is ridiculously polite quick tip for aussies remember to stick to the right when walking make use of the fast pass system this park got quite busy before the parade at p m the pirates of the caribbean broke down as did the matterhorn during the day ,4,2015-09-23
3762,Best place ever!!!,this is definitely a place to at least go once in your lifetime so many rides happy people great food and just makes you feel like a kid again great for family fun or a date disneyland is for everyone ,5,2015-09-23
3763,Happiest place on earth!,disneyland who doesn t love disneyland even if you don t have much time i highly recommend one whole day at disneyland and another whole day at california adventure that s all the time we had this last trip we went in january with a year old a month old nana aunty mom and dad so of us total this was my year old s first trip to disneyland we knew we wouldn t be able to park hop so we saved a little bit of money by not getting the park hopper we just made sure to go to the right park on the day that we wanted to see the special event like world of wonder or the parade be sure to check the schedules ahead of time because we went during a not so busy time of the year they weren t doing the aladdin show during the week we were there wednesday and thursday we also knew that we wouldn t be able to do all of the rides in the one day we had at each park so my son and i went over all of the rides and i had him pick rides that we definitely wanted to get to we also had a few additional rides that the adults wanted to do on the list as well as some other shows and special things we made sure the jedi training academy was also on our schedule we definitely took advantage of the baby swap of us plus the year old went on the ride first while the other one stayed behind with the baby you just tell the cast member when you before you board the ride and they give you a pass to use the fast pass lane when they were done the other one of us went on the ride along with the year old again so my son got to go on some of the rides twice rewind a little bit at the beginning of the day be sure to get to the gate atleast minutes before the gates open if you get the early morning entry be sure to take advantage of that we also went to customer service and got a pin for my son for his first time visit and one for my mother in law for her birthday and all day long everyone was saying happy birthday to my mother in law so if this is your first time or if you re celebrating a special occasion be sure to stop by and get your souviner pins as far as meeting the characters go in the morning mickey and minnie always seem to be out front for a souviner for my son we went to target the day before and got him a t shirt so the characters can sign it for him i thought this was better than the autograph book so he would have something he can wear for another couple of years if you want to do this you need to make sure that you re not wearing the shirt they can t sign shirts if they are wearing it i ended up having to buy my son a new shirt right at the entrance that day we saw minnie alice in wonderland the mad hatter goofy chip and dale we went and saw pooh and eeyore out by the winnie the pooh ride we also saw donald and daisy in toon town in the evening and waited in line to see mickey at mickey s house we ended up seeing goofy again too after that we saw merida at night right as we were walking out of the park we saw mickey and minnie again too for other souviners we also went around and got penny presses wherever we could find them we brought a roll of pennies and quarters with us for this we probably made of them and also bought a penny press book we also did the jedi training academy i believe they have several times a day that they do that we made sure to get there minutes before the start of the show and had my son sit down early you really need to make sure that they are excited about it so that they can pick you but be sure to tell the kids if they don t get picked they need to not get upset not all kids get picked but they sure to try as far as food goes the official rule is that you cannot bring in food or drinks but as long as you are not bringing in a full meal for everyone they are ok with it we brought a small soft sided cooler and filled it with bottle of water frozen this will act as ice to keep everything cold and melt along the way so you can drink later make sure to wrap a paper towel around it absorb the condensation another bottle of water cold and a few snacks cliff bars and a couple uncrustable sandwiches frozen pb j i also made sure my son had a fanny pack and he carried a juice pouch and cliff bars with him for lunch we had soup bread bowls by the pirates of the caribbean ride cheap for theme park and filling for everyone not much seating so we just sat wherever there was a spot we also ate at the caf at the jedi training academy nothing fancy there everything in the theme park is expensive so just make sure to budget for it i also heard that the fried chicken at the plaza inn is very good but we didn t get to try it the rides are all great my son didn t like the indiana jones ride so much so it s a good thing we did that first but we wanted him to try it the rest of the day was good after that since we were there in january it wasn t as busy we were able to get through all of the rides that we wanted to and didn t wait more than minutes for any ride most of the rides were minutes or under we even went on some of the rides a couple times disneyland is expensive not going to lie about that but its worth the experience just be sure to budget well be sure to also have a budget for ears we all got ears and also got our names stitched in them and the year its fun for everyone old and young if you have littler ones years then staying near the park isn t a bad idea so you can go back to take naps our son was so we didn t need to go back to our hotel we just went all day and crashed really hard at night we didn t stay near the park on one day we drove to the park and parked in the garage its very convenient everyone whether you re a kid or an adult should visit disneyland at some point put it on your bucket list ,5,2015-09-22
3764,Substandard Ride Reliability/Availability,our family drove down from canada with our rv fortunately this wasn t the main focus of our trip some of the pros disney band was good the parade was good the park has a lot of attention to detail some of the cons over priced food insane lineups we averaged rides a day reliability of the rides was substandard splash mountain had a break down when we were in line with fast pass a raft ride in california adventure broke down when in line with fast pass pirates of the caribean closed the fast pass apparently has quotas and could not be used for the cars ride in california adventure the art transportation sign outside of disney is out dated we got on the wrong bus route has changed and sign is not updated another problem was we had a day art pass these are only consecutive uses so be mindful if you take a day off disney park long story short the kids moderately enjoyed disneyland but if i never see the park again i can t say i would miss it i will however check out there public stocks because that place is a cash cow with the markups ,2,2015-09-22
3765,"Best day out ... Even for an ""oldie""",this trip with a group of teenage basketballers was the best fun i ve had in years sure there were queues and the food wasn t cheap but it didn t matter watching youngsters having the time of their lives and enjoying the moments was worth every dollar of the fairly expensive admission ,5,2015-09-22
3766,Great time again!,my daughter and i visited here in august we have been many times it is always wonderful coming back we had so much fun the crowds weren t too bad have seen worse my only negative would be that the cast members seemed really miserable and unhappy i don t know if it was because it was the end of summer and they were exhausted but we felt that they have been much friendlier in the past apart from this had a wonderful time ,4,2015-09-19
3767,Very Disgruntled,loved disneyland until yesterday tried to go into parking structure but were diverted to the toy story lot where we waited for a bus to bring us to the park we paid the regular to park miles away and arrived an hour later it is clear disney does not care about guests when we went to city hall to ask about this we were told there is nothing they can do about it it wasn t the case of the lot being full because as we left and hoards of people were still streaming in the parking structure was open will not renew pass ,2,2015-09-19
3768,Our grandsons 6 th birthday,well what can i say disneyland is the most amazing please around yes it is pricey but every cent you spend there is the best dollar you will spend for fun and family entertainment we took our grandchildren and daughter for the year olds birthday it was not our first trip to disneyland i can remember how many time we my husband and our kids have gone guessing it could be or more it never gets old it is always evolving the only part of disneyland that needs work is tomorrow land but i now know it will be upgraded very soon the best place we went was minnie s breakfast the characters there are so kind to the kids of all ages my year old grandson was hugged so tight from tigger and the fairy godmother granted my daughter every wish we are just an average family that can find joy and happiness in the magic kingdom we also think disneyland is the best of all the disneys ever built fantasmic is the best show created do not miss this show now go and have fun you can not do this park justice with a day pass days at the least have fun enjoy ,5,2015-09-17
3769,"Ouch, the price! Half the rides closed.",came here from australia and was pretty disappointed at rides being closed tonnes of kids to be expected and lots of older men by themselves creepy the amount of people abusing the disabled access was ridiculous truely disgusting lines were long for everything and little shade in c heat would not be back ,3,2015-09-17
3770,Disneyland - 60 years - and stands the test of time!,i have vacationed in disneyland since i was and my grandson has accompanied me since he was that s a lot of wonderful vacations at the happiest place on earth we vacation elsewhere but have spent from days in disneyland and california adventure for eight of the last years and will return next summer if not before i recapture my childhood and it is only enhanced when i see my grandson having an absolutely fantastic time riding the many attractions and just meandering through the parks people watching and exploring the myriad of shops i think the only down side are the huge strollers and many appeared to be parents with just an infant the park has tried to corral them but unlike the rental strollers these are sometimes three across and they just don t enhance the visit especially when they mindlessly stop in the middle of the walk ways or streets or block the entrance and aisles in the stores i get the love of disneyland for all ages but these little ones won t remember it and mom and or dad look worn out and frazzled go when the kids are old enough to actively participate and enjoy this grand experience ,5,2015-09-16
3771,Amazing,me and my husband and children had a day pass for both parks we had a great time the ratatouille ride was amazing just some staff could of been nicer and friendlier and the waiting times for some queues where wrong they said minutes but waited about minutes and the fast pass machines were not working most of the time and then every day there where technical problems or there where broken carriages on another of rides i think with the money you pay to get in they should be able to maintain these issues asap but overall we enjoyed our time and the show in the evening was amazing ,4,2015-09-13
3772,Ran the half marathon then....,always a thrill to go to the parks a little disappointed that some of my favorite rides were down and that it s not autism friendly ,2,2015-09-12
3773,Great fun,we had great fun and the park was as good as we imagined beautiful parades especially the night one and the fireworks were impressive the park was not too crowded and the attractions were great the gluten free options in restaurants were great ,5,2015-09-09
3774,Brilliant!!! My kids loved it all.,almost all the local kids were back at school and we went on week days most queues for rides were min or less staff check bags before you enter the precinct no selfie sticks but personal water bottles were okay ,5,2015-09-09
3775,Wayyyy downhill lately; Frightenly bad crowd control.,the park has gone way downhill lately especially in regard to crowd control i visited on labor day which i knew would be busy i ve been to magic kingdom in fl on christmas day when they ve had to cap attendance so i m fine with dealing with crowds bigger than this however the way disney performed you d think they d never seen big crowds before they mismanaged the traffic parking so badly it took an hour and a half to park at am once we were within miles of the park cast members kept telling us we shouldn t have come on labor day which is something a customer should never be told multiple rides were down with no signs out front at first including most of tomorrowland the monorail couldn t run in the heat but they had no backup plan so guests were forced to walk to downtown disney hotels in the high heat large crowds major heat stress health risks our security person was a rude clueless woman which was frightening on such a crowded day at a place like disney to make matters worse disneyland s own actions led to the chaos rude cast members kept saying labor day is one of the worst days of the year if that s the case why did disney hold a marathon that weekend bringing in more guests why did they allow the day to be open for annual passholders they did nothing to cap attendance then couldn t handle it and even complained about it to paying guests ridiculous for how much money you pay disney should be used to this by now and have some standards ,2,2015-09-08
3776,Unhappinest place on earth.,i used to love disneyland i hate to say it but it sucks horribly now they let it get so crowded you can barely move they hardly ever change anything so there is never much new to see what they did change is now you need a fast pass to even see fantasmic at all or pay ridiculous amounts of extra money for actual seats they hardly changed anything in fantasmic anyway same old story same water effects you can see much better in las vegas maybe i am too old for amusement parks but standing in line in the heat all day for two minute rides is not something i find enjoyable ,1,2015-09-08
3777,Magical any time of year,visited between xmas and new year because of other commitments omg busy busy busy the one week off for there xmas holidays and there big footy final in california at one stage we thought they are letting in too many people crowd crush evident i was amazed how quick disney staff took over the crowd control but as aussies we kept walking on the left wrong as they drive opposite to us that s how it works on foot to pick your month to go it can get very hot in summer months be patient if you see a wait line for minutes that s good hop on then if you go back later it could jump up to hours wait yes it happens highlight for us the endless disney shops on main street all xmas theme in the streets kept up until end of january the xmas themed parades were amazing run to the minute good viewing wherever you are this is the best time to jump in a cue if you don t have a fast pass remember some rides you cant wear reading glasses for obvious reasons so wear contacts if u can that day winter months are no different to melbourne so wear layers as when the sun comes out in california its quite warm still every disney park is layed out exactly the same you will know this straight away if you go to others where to go downtown disney is where all the restaurants and major shopping is easy walk from the park so cute seeing all the kids dressed in there frozen outfits this themed shop was huge everything and everything was there a little girls dream come true we did disney in a day with no fast passes but it was go go go grabbed coffee on the go drunk it in line don t expect melbourne standards its like drip filter coffee starbucks in downtown disney always packed staff throughout the usa were just learning how to make the new latte coffee s that aussies kiwis love don t expect chocy on your cappuccinos either go to the bakery for supplies to take back to your room and there s a great juice place just near this for the healthy teenagers stock up early for the next day as they sell out fast because that s what everyone does to save time and money expect to pay plus tax for the mickey mouse shaped bread loaf tastes like sweet sourdough for wining and dinning napa valley wines are the best not a bad drop of chardy compared to australian wines tipping essential they only earn per hour here so we often tipped of bill they love us aussies we loved showing the yanks our colorful money as they cant afford to travel here much so if you can show them some pics of oz they love that and you will get the best service hope these tips help ,5,2015-09-08
3778,My Top 10 Tips for a Successful Visit to Disneyland, do early entrance when you can it will be the least crowded experience at the park you will get immediately get a fast pass for a ride then go wait in line for another pay attention to the fast pass times always have a fast pass some rides attractions don t count and towards the fastpass at a time rule get a fastpass for fantasmic to get better seating make a plan focus on one land in the park at a time so that you are not running back and forth all over the park all day see the fireworks and parade at night you won t be disappointed at night on the adventureland side of main st they open a back walkway behind the stores use it for a faster exit research and understand the rider switch pass single rider disabled rider fast pass and others to know what you can take advantage of while in the park exit the park and go eat at story tellers cafe at the grand californian before pm for a less expensive dinner during a full day take a mid day break head to the grand californian park the kids at the little rocking chairs and movie playing near the fireplace in the lobby then head over to the bar and get an adult drink don t take yourself or anyone else to seriously remember you are creating memories make them happy ones ,5,2015-09-06
3779,MAGIC!,i came to disneyland for my birthday this year with my girlfriend i have not been since i was but now living in arizona we were able to go easily it s only about a hr drive this was the best birthday of my life this place is just so amazing nothing beats it you gotta be a kid at heart to be here if you can t appreciate what it is then it s not for you everything is perfect service characters rides food shows stores etc there s a hundred stores to buy plenty of lovely things from a variety of kid friendly and adult rides a lot are cutesy ride throughs for movies but they re still great expect lines and don t be impatient about it it s just what it is get fast passes when you can and go early weekday is less busy than weekend for sure august was great too not as many kids because they re back to school but it s hot we were here during the th celebration which is amazing the decorations for it are so beautiful the parade paint the night is so fun and colorful the technology is spectacular the fireworks are magical expect tears if you have a way of being on big thunder during fireworks do we happened to and it was so cool take advantage of the parade fireworks to get to usually busy rides can be frustrating getting through main street during these things but within the park is fine we watched them the first night and then we were ok to not see them the other nights as they re the same we didn t watch fantasmic but i saw it online and it s so cute too i m sure better in person we passed it for a minute and it looked cool if you re coming here come with plenty of money great gifts and items to buy and food is pricey it s a money needing vacation this is a must go place couples families kids or no kids gay friendly and just so amazing ah can t wait to go back ,5,2015-09-06
3780,"Still the Original ""Happiest Place on Earth""",the first thing that hit me was how small the castle was being season pass holders at disneyworld we are used to the towering cinderella castle i loved how close all the attractions were some of them were a little hidden so you had to look at your map carefully here is my list of thoughts matterhorn too rough but fun no ac in food service areas tomorrowland terrace is inside and air conditioned in orlando there are small difference in almost all attractions unless they are video based like soarin storybook land canal boats is still wonderful and updated the stroller and wheelchair rental is outside the gates you get your tickets go inside then have to go back outside with a stamp to rent anything frustrating i like that the entrances of disneyland and california adventure are about yards apart ,4,2015-09-04
3781,Have always LOVED Disneyland!, friends and i went on the hottest day in august i would not recommend that the hot and humid air makes people very cranky and many people were i love disneyland and because of the cost and because i expect it i want the best from their castmembers this time i did not get that i stopped a cast member to ask directions and she said i can t answer you i m on a tour and she turned around and walked away rude rude rude i was in shock because all of the times i have been there not once have i ever encountered anyone cast member who was rude i went to guest relations to make a complaint and the guy acted like a jerk like he was making fun of me i was not happy with that either he took down the name of the cast member who was rude but i noticed he did not spell it right he didn t want my name of any other info the only reason i was making this complaint was because people expect more from disney and they deserve it since it costs so much to go there if i did not complain how would they know that this person was rude while i still love disneyland and i will still go there i want a deserve not to be treated rudely ,4,2015-09-02
3782,Wow and Wow,one of those places that live up to the hype and you wont regret spending most of a day here just remember where you are it is for the kids and it is rightly so very expensive the attention to detail is outstanding the availability and waiting times for rides are completely unacceptable they put on a consistently good show i had a five day pass and went times ,4,2015-08-28
3783,Real Disney but different than Paris or Orlando parks,this specific disney park was established in by walt disney himself and although some new attractions were added the park is a lot smaller than the other parks i visited what is the same the cast is really good the food plenty all is very well organized and there is plenty of joy on the faces of the guests the park is more focused on families with smaller kids because the amount of thrill rides is not as big and because of the age of most attractions space mountain is by far the nicest ride indiana jones and starwars are also fun but really dated one of the hidden gems is the abraham lincoln attraction in main street it is a big hidden but very impressive our food experience was not bad but i was amazed how little healthy choices there are because of the limited size of the park and the limited number of thrill rides we spend about six hours in the park including the lunch time i can imagine that some think that the dollar a person entree fee is a little high compared for what you get in other attractions in socal the first thing that guests that did visit other parks before is the smaller sizes of the castle and main street ,4,2015-08-27
3784,Always great fun,i don t know how many times i ve been here but i always love it this is a little magical oasis from the real world ,5,2015-08-27
3785,Out Of This World.,we travelled from australia to do disneyland and oh boy what a trip it was it was totally breath taking our and year old kids where in heaven so much to see and do we spend weeks here off and on through the parks our daughter had her th birthday dressed up as cinderella and with cinderella so much great stuff i can say about this place but you really need to experience it it s another world when inside ,5,2015-08-26
3786,Where it all started....,basically the moment i walked onto main street my eyes welled with tears there is nothing like the feel of disneyland just a truly magical place we had such an amazing time a lot of rides here are a little older but that makes them even more special with the use of the fast pass and great planning we were able to go on everything and indiana jones twice a great great ride the shows are great and we loved meeting the characters in february a lot of rides were closed at once which was a bit disappointing as well as the castle being covered up for the th anniversary but we still loved every minute ,5,2015-08-25
3787,Disappointing...,i was able to compare disneyland to disney world and must say that i was disappointed cast members were less than friendly in a number if instances and that made for a much less than magical experience given the chance again i would opt for disney world over disneyland ,3,2015-08-25
3788,Save your money & go to Walt Disney World,yes it is the original park i was excited to see that piece of history of course it is amazing to view all these iconic pieces from the s but here is the major issue the cast members were very unpleasant maybe i m bias because i am an annual passholder at wdw and so was my friend who i went with both of us were so surprised by how many unhappy people worked there we met cast members who were amazing but as the day progressed the level of disgruntled employee progressed as well they were unknowlegable or just dismissive they didn t want to pin trade and made it seem as we were annoying them when we asked i get that it was a hot summer day but these are paid employees of the disney brand they need to step up their attentiveness and be more likable walt disney world cast members really have a massive leg up on their west cost parent it s great to go to this place once but i don t see any reason to go back except for the holiday celebrations and decorations ,3,2015-08-24
3789,Who gives em' 1 star??!,i mean it s disney for pete sakes you know what you re getting into when you go there it s expensive but sooooo worth it yes the lines are long but we found they typically moved faster than the signs suggested as we are child free i can only review adults attractions twilight zone tower of terror was so fun we luuuuuhved it and wanted to go again do it at night it s way cool space mountain is an icon ya gotta ride it i don t think a roller coaster is as thrilling when you can t anticipate the next twist turn but it s still plenty fun matterhorn might be considered politically incorrect with the stereotype but that s why it s funny use the app to plan ahead but use the gps map on your phone to navigate way easier than paper maps and the constant signing in required for the app they need to fix that it s brutal plus it gave us error messages about every rd try ,5,2015-08-23
3790,Fun for all ages,it s expensive but a classic restaurants are very helpful with my two little boys who have severe food allergies chefs come out and talk personally close to a lot of hotels only a ten minute walk from red lion hotel ,4,2015-08-23
3791,Save your pennies and pre-plan for best value,my party consisted of adults teen and kid my sister has done disney world in fla times since my year old niece has done it times since they both love disney world i tried to tell them disneyland was not comparable but my niece insisted on it for her birthday both of them had a blast disneyland is less crowded and has some attractions disney world does not my sister was also awed by its location to so many hotels within walking distance she is a master at timing rides and fast passes so we were able to do everything we wanted and some duplicates in one day a family who prefers to wing it should plan on at least two days the paint the night parade lasts minutes and is spectacular we waited for the midnight show and had a great vantage point near the entrance gates get your spot about minutes beforehand the earlier show is cram packed so do the late one if you can disneyland is expensive so i rate everything on value if you or someone in your family loves disney then it s a good value you ll get a kick out of seeing the wonder in your kids eyes but be prepared to spend a small fortune you are allowed to carry totes and back packs into the park and ours were filled with snacks and bottled water this beats spending scads of money on disney food every ride has either a place on the ride to stow backpacks totes or has storage cubes outside the ride don t listen to anyone who says splash mountain doesn t get you that wet all of us were soaked and i mean head to toe socks shoes underwear the whole nine yards honestly i deducted a circle because i find more vacation dollar value doing something else i know that s a personal thing but i tried to consider the average family viewpoint in my review and i think it s a lot of money for what you get by the time you add up the tickets hotel food souvenirs etc wheelchairs can be rented for per day and motorized scooters for ,4,2015-08-22
3792,Not as magical as our past visits,disney is an incredible place however the th anniversary brought very very long waits and way too many attractions broke down on our party of during our day stay one day we were at the park between am pm we were in line all day and add it on four rides that is it we waited an additional hours in other rides that all broke down while we were in line and we were unable to ride them it was a disappointing and expensive day the other days went well for our family ,3,2015-08-17
3793,The best of the Disney Parks,to be clear i ve not yet been to any of the parks abroad but my reason for loving disneyland over the other parks must hold true and i do love all disney destinations hotels and cruises but in disneyland walt s loving touch still permeates the experience there s just something truly magical about disneyland itself if you must go during school breaks and holidays be prepared to wait in line take advantage of the magic morning if you can utilize the fast pass system catch the last shows and parades of the day after many people especially those with children have left the park during parades and certain shows is a great opportunity to hop on many rides check for single rider lines at some of the more popular rides have a montecristo sandwich at cafe orleans or blue bayou blue bayou is a little more expensive but it s inside the pirates of the caribbean ride so the atmosphere is incredible make reservations early like a couple of days early in fact make your lunch reservations for am and ask for a table near the water railing am is your best chance at getting that table toontown has some great interactive photo ops ,5,2015-08-17
3794,"Love Disney, but HATE Roped-off areas",we love disneyland we go appx once every two years we ve noticed more and more areas getting roped off for fantasmic fireworks parades bands etc although we love these features we hate the chaos the roped off areas creates last night the crowd was forced behind pirates in new orleans square along where indiana jones the jungle cruise are this was an absolute zoo with the crowd claustrophobic i don t freak out with crowds but this was ridiculous i ll avoid those areas during show times in the future but as always staff was friendly and helpful food is better than expected fast pass is awesome if you get a good system with it and the magic is there the castle looks cool with the th anniversary decorations and the new light parade is fantastic ,4,2015-08-16
3795,Fun but to crowded,enjoyed seeing disneyland we have been to disney world in florida may times disneyland was very crowded and not very clean loved the fireworks ,3,2015-08-11
3796,So many different levels of enjoyment...,disneyland is one of those places where every time you go it s different in my case i was born and raised in southern california so i ve been at least once a year and it s always a good time we ve hit a point where we don t feel a need to make it on every ride we go where our mood takes us and don t kill ourselves to stand hours in line for a ride honestly i can t remember the last time i waited over an hour for a ride disneyland and california adventure changed their fastpass policy sometime in the last two years in my opinion for the worse as an engineer i understand why they now strictly enforce their fastpass times but as a guest i hate it when you get a fastpass for any ride you now must come back within the window there may be a grace period after i know there is in florida or you lose out on that pass it sucks and it makes for more planning in any given trip especially when you hop between parks fastpasses are still an absolute must just make sure you can actually go during the time you get they are free though so if you miss your window it s not the end of the world based on my tens of times there these are my recommendations rides space mountain mandatory buzz lightyear great for kids and competitive people splash mountain if you have time to dry before it s cold if not talk your friends family kids out of it i have actually had to buy clothes before because i was too soaked and didn t dry before i froze canoes physical exercise to justify whatever you eat next matterhorn fun fact the last park employee i spoke with said they still call the monster harold storybook boats i am the only one in my family that loves this ride but i think it s awesome you get to sit for minutes and look at adorable small villages indiana jones prepare to be jostled big thunder mountain surprisingly really fun if you re riding while the fireworks are going off note all of the rides are really pretty great but these are a few that i for sure recommend restaurants plaza cafe i love the pot roast and if you go late enough in the evening just camp out and watch the fireworks from a cozy table with a cup of coffee such a nice way to enjoy the show mexican restaurant in frontierland still don t know the name of this place but it s been a mexican restaurant with different names for as long as i can remember great for lunch or dinner blue bayou expensive but treat yourself at least once if the waiter doesn t point it out make sure to stare at the tree and look for the shooting star on the roof the other restaurants are fine too but these are my favs several of the others are basically overpriced burgers pizza and chicken sandwiches i ve been on dates with friends with my family and with extended family it s great always but best enjoyed with people that are going to enjoy it just as much as you ,5,2015-08-10
3797,Not Disney World but Magical Time just the same,ok ok so here is the deal my family and i are big disney fans we absolutely love disney world in florida and go at last once a year for the last years some years we have gone twice this was the first time going to california disneyland let me start by saying it is much smaller in size much more compact this means that the crowds are ridiculous we went on a saturday in august so everyone was there we got there at am when doors open and left at midnight we had to go on as many rides as possible we did all the rides we wanted we did not ride peter pan mr toads wild ride alice in wonderland mad tea party dumbo snow white s scary adventures the carrousel mark twain riverboat great moments with mr lincoln astro orbiters pinocchio s daring journey the many adventures of winnie the pooh davy crockett s explorer canoes or gadgets go coaster i wanted to name them all to show you how many we did not have time to do in a hour day with only one quick lunch stop so in case you want to do all the ride i suggest getting a day pass most lines were hour to hours we utilized the fast pass system as much as possible i suggest looking at the map to see what rides accept fast passes and start getting them as soon as you get there on the rides you don t want to miss a fast passes are every hours all the rides were great the people were friendly best rides there are the indiana jones ride for those who love disney world the castle is about a quarter of the size must watch fantasmic get a fast pass for better area to watch must watch aladdin the musical simply amazing the new parade they have paint the night is a must do we are not parade people however i would watch this over and over again if i could the fireworks are also good try to watch them on main street it actually snows great touch ,5,2015-08-10
3798,Never too old,we were there for the th anniversary it was amazing the night parade was magical the fact you can t have selfie sticks in the parks was a blessing as was a nightmare at universal we didn t get to enjoy park fully we didn t know when we booked was the anniversary if visited again would do so outside peak time still magical ,4,2015-08-10
3799,"Disneyland, how has it changed in 10 years?",my wife and i are huge disney fans we have just returned to australia after a week stay during july august at disneyland we have celebrated our th anniversary you might be horrified with the lengh of stay but if you have a year and a year old you need to pace yourself when visiting the parks we had a day hopper pass for the family that saved us heaps the last time we visited was years ago in summer when it is hot and you have small children in toe think gte get there early do your research beforehand get the unofficial guide to disneyland and it will save you a lot of pain here is what is different after years food better quality but much more expensive and less choice merchandise way more expensive cast members maybe its the heat but we came across way too many grumpy employees in serious need of some pixie dust are they being treated badly by management last time the cast members made the visit special this time around not so walt disney wanted to create a park where families could have fun together everything has become very corporate and increasingly expensive for the average family this is a shame i honestly think disney is damaging their brand by charging for a pencil we did not buy much we were planning to come back in years for our th anniversary not so sure now it is still a good place to visit but not fantastic as before dl has lost some magic and soul i hear a rumour that toontown is going to be demoulished to make way for star wars land i hope this is not true i have inspired countless people to visit disneyland over the years now having been here again i am not so sure anymore i hope things change for the better ,4,2015-08-09
3800,Childhood dream come true,this place is fantastic all childhood favourites and recent addition makes this place a great holiday destination for children and adults lines can be long its disneyland after all but if the fast passes are utilised properly then there will be enough time for all your favourite rides ,5,2015-08-08
3801,Loved our visit,we live in florida so we were expecting more than we should have being disneyland is so much smaller however we left feeling amazingly impressed with the experience here very pleased not overly crowded for being the summer parking was easy will come again ,4,2015-08-07
3802,Family Favorite,our favorite place to be we are all adults and love every minute we are together when in disneyland although we live hours of driving from here we had annual passes for the last year and went a total of days ,5,2015-08-07
3803,DISNEYLAND HAS THE SAME MAGIC AS MAGIC KINGDOM,my family and i went to disneyland for a day back in july for the th anniversary it wasn t too hot and the lines weren t even that long along with that there weren t many tour groups and nobody really smelled i guess in california people know how to use deodorant the only problem i had with guests were the foreigners who don t know how to walk and even some of the people who live in america i m sorry but in america when we are going down to toontown we walk on the right side of the path and when we are heading back up to fantasyland we walk on the left we aren t in england i really enjoyed how friendly the younger cast members were the older cast members were actually not very nice at all like they are at walt disney world they didn t look happy to be there and when we asked one of the older ones who looked like he d been there from the start a question he answered with a very bitter attitude and i actually felt like i was at six flags some of the rides i have to admit were better then the ones at magic kingdom in florida two rides that are at both parks are haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean i love both rides at both parks but i like the ones at disneyland better because they had a different stuff and they felt longer i especially like pirates and the little swampy feel at the beginning of the ride the food was better then at disney world s too my burger wasn t burned like they are at disney world and it was juicier the french fries were also nice and they actually had potato in it and if you re there during the th i highly recommend getting the mickey or minnie th rice krispy treat on a stick mine was very good and i liked the white chocolate diamonds on it i also liked the tigger tail that my sister had i do however have one complaint about our experience and that was the firework show i had heard so many good things about the show and i was very excited to see it since it was special to the th anniversary however that specific night we were there the show was cancelled due to clouds but when i looked up at the sky all i saw were stars and a cloud here and there i don t know what the deal was but i was very very upset with disney and then the cast members were rude when we were trying to main street but they wouldn t let us through i ended my disneyland experience disappointed because although the food was good and the rides were good i wasn t happy with the cast members as a whole there were nice ones here and there like the one that gave us free fast passes to go on space mountain but altogether they didn t give off the magical feeling like they do at walt disney world they were hanging out with their friends other cast members and being rude to the guests my personal favorite cast member experience was when i was trying to get help and two cast members were having a personal conversation and paid attention to the guest me standing in front of them waiting for help disneyland is very magical and it was a fun day going on the rides but the people who don t know how to walk the rude cast members and the canceling of the firework show really ruined my experience will i be back maybe if i ever go back to california but maybe i ll try california adventure next time ,4,2015-08-06
3804,Mixed feelings,we were excited to visit for the th year celebration however the long lines and broken down rides put a damper on our spirits still enjoy the disney atmosphere but seems some cast members in california could use a little refresher on the disney magic certainly not as friendly as florida it is convenient to walk from park to park and not have to take a bus ,3,2015-08-06
3805,DisneyWorld is way better!,small park large crowds not many thrill rides outdated fast pass system you only need a day base ticket to do both parks don t be fooled by people who tell you to get a park hopper or a day pass ,3,2015-08-06
3806,Super Family Vacation,disneyland the happiest place on earth there isn t much to complain about here the place is magical good trip for families as well as couples young and old can appreciate it ,5,2015-08-06
3807,DisneyLand Loosing the Magic,i just visited disneyland in ca on technology is not the way to go at the front gate print your tickets i tried to use ticket in my email to enter the gate and had multiple problems the scanner cannot read the bar code and as a result we were penalized after waiting in line minutes we were told to go to another line and the attendant yelled at us in front of all the guest for going to the front of the line which we were told to do after frustrating minutes finally they let us in even thought are bar code would not work also there is a good amount of abuse with people not wanting to wait in the lines and claiming disabilities so i found the walking people are penalized because of all the fraud and people working the system the attendants working the line seem to be overwhelmed and frustrated i think walt would be disappointed ,3,2015-08-06
3808,Always a homerun,great themed parks within a park go to chicken dinner restaraunt for very best food in the park besides blue bayou lol and a great place to watch fireworks from great show btw ,5,2015-08-05
3809,The magic is getting expensive,i have been visiting disney since i was years old and it s always fun the place the people and the coasters are superb but this last time tickets were dlls for park day i remember the days when they cost dlls also the superb churros are now bucks when they used to be dll i m worried that the dream of walt disney to create a theme park for middle class is morphing into an elite park for upper class only one day we wouldn t be able to take our kids without expending thousands of dollars p s rides are closed during fantasmic and opened when it finishes so run or stay close to the one you like the most and be the first in the line ,4,2015-08-05
3810,Best time out!,this was an amazing days of our trip i really want to take the kids here to save time use the fastpass service and plan your rides an hour in advance it is no extra cost and only takes a little extra planning make sure you bring hat and sunglasses of course and if you are a woman do not wear anything red with polkadots unless you want to have kids pointing at you all day saying minnie mauus the rides are amazing and you can also get an entry into california adventure which has some of our favourite thrill rides including the hollywood tower if you are riding the hollywood tower and a woman do not keep your belongings in your bra thinking they are secure they will fly out and hit the roof and come crashing back down with force like a ballbearing in a paint shaker ,5,2015-08-04
3811,Disappointing when compared to Walt Disney World in Florida.,this was a bit of a disappointment when compared to walt disney world in orlando fl much smaller and very very crowded even though they do a good job of hiding the lines it is just uncomfortable and way too pricey compared to what you get in florida at walt disney world ,3,2015-08-04
3812,An epic adventure,disneyland is huge we had a three day pass to cover both parks within the complex and definitely needed every one of those days use the fast pass to cut down on some of the waiting time but still expect to queue for forty to sixty minutes per ride the great things about these queues was that the waiting area itself is interactive and has you moving through buildings rather than just standing in a line the rides are certainly designed for family s so don t expect thrill seeker level i think everyone has to go to disneyland once in their life though i would recommend this complex to everyone two days would reasonably cover the rides if you are not with kids with kids you would need the full third day ,5,2015-08-04
3813,"Fun time, go early!",much less pomp and circumstance compared to disneyland orlando but many of the same or similar rides and attractions with a few new ones mixed in top two tips arrive early as close to opening as possible and get the app for ride wait times on your phone we walked from our hotel so we had no parking experience we utilized a park hopper and with kids aged were glad we did we went on about rides from to then headed over to disney adventureland for the rest of the day wait times for both parks were much worse in the afternoon we didn t need to utilize fast passes for anything in disneyland and didn t wait for more than mintues for anything however wait times were much longer in the afternoon according to the app and we skipped some of the rides younger kids might desire such as peter pan certainly not a cheap day single day park hopper passes were about each bottom line was we had a good time and went on every ride and saw everything we wanted to see ,4,2015-08-03
3814,Fantastic....but crowded,well worth the hr flight from oz if you can go early in the morning to get on the rides you want use the fast pass whenever you can and pace yourself it does get bloody crowded but that s what to expect the turkey legs are awesome take plenty of water in the summer time ,5,2015-08-03
3815,Strategic planning for a Disney summer visit,we have been to disneyland times in the summer and always have a lot of fun is it hot and crowded yes are there long lines for the best rides yes is it expensive yes it can be but we ve always followed a few basic tour rules that help us see the most and wait the least amount of time rule get to the park before opening time and head to the most popular rides first e g space mountain indiana jones it means getting up early but a disney vacay is not a restful one but you can often ride multiple times on the best rides with little to no wait time in line when the lines start to get long start using fastpasses and go on to other rides attractions e g small world etc or go have lunch rule use fastpasses as much as possible for california adventure too we never stand in line if the wait time is more than min get a fastpass for later and move on also read up about different rides on line some have monster long lines and are not worth the hours you ll wait we found this our years ago on the nemo submarine ride rule be willing to crisscross the park to get to the most popular rides first this is much harder to do if you have little kids but my son was able to do it at age we used a cheap umbrella stroller from home when necessary when he was tired there are really popular rides in each of the lands so to get on them before the lines get super long you have to ride one then leave that land and carry on to the next land and popular ride most people do not seem to do this they go to one area of the park and stay there until they ve done all the rides there it does mean more walking but you get more ride time rule always carry snacks and water with you so you can eat in line and not waste valuable aka less crowded ride time eating save a bigger meal for later when the park is crowded rule stay as close to the park as possible you may get a better hotel price farther away but it takes much longer getting to and from the park on hotel shuttles we always stay somewhere close enough to walk you ll also be very happy about this when you see the long lines to get on the shuttles at the end of the day ,5,2015-08-02
3816,Third Year in a row,disney is always a super fun day there is so much to do and see and experience there are rides for every level of thrill seeker and for every age of adventurer always one of the more expensive parts of my la trips but always worth it ,5,2015-08-02
3817,Don't miss the 60th Celebration and Paint the Night,wishing they would enhance the fast pass program like they do with florida otherwise still the happiest place on earth especially for the th celebration,4,2015-08-02
3818,Disney night,i m more a universal studios person but when i go to disney i go with a partner in crime the best experience tho was able to see most of the electric parade the best thing to do is eat at the country place and wait until the parade starts find a table near the bushes and stay there ,5,2015-08-01
3819,"Crowded, but worth it!",i have been to disneyland multiple times this was the first time i have been there in years we stayed on property at the paradise pier hotel i have also stayed at the disneyland hotel in the past the park is very very crowded the best way to explain it would be like a concert on the floor during the parades and fireworks it is shoulder to shoulder people some of which are pushing wheelchairs and strollers through the crowd while on this trip i noticed a couple things that i wanted to mention as possible improvements the monorail i am not sure why disneyland allows people to get on this as a way to rest their feet and escape the heat the monorail makes stops one in downtown disney and then in tomorrowland people would get on and just ride and ride around and around to rest this makes the lines incredibly long we waited for monorails to come in dd before we were finally able to get on i think they should force everyone to get off at each location if they want to get back on they should have to get back in line i understand that disney has a deal with coke so i get that they do not sell other products inside the park but i was very annoyed to learn they have also banned companies such as rainforest cafe espn zone and starbucks from selling other products like red bull the only energy drink you can purchase is monster and the only water is dasani fast pass i wondered if this system had changed since i was here years ago much to my dismay i discovered it hasn t you can only have fast pass at a time and to get it you have to go to the location of the ride this makes for a great deal of walking around i am not sure why disney doesn t just put fast pass machines inside the gates of the parks since you can only have at a time why not just allow guests to pick which ride they want a fast pass for when they first get there rather than making them walk all the way through the park to get the fast pass they also allow too many people at a time to get a fp the lines were shorter but we still had to wait for at least minutes for the rides we did get a fp for other amusement parks i have been to allow guests to purchase a special express pass to the shorter lines i understand this limits who gets them but the fp system is not really good in my opinion it needs an overhaul lastly i think disneyland has too many parades and shows this causes so many bottlenecks which makes people including cast members grumpy they either need to close one of the parks rides totally down and only have it open for people watching the parade or show or else only have them once a day trying to get through the crowds during fantasmic world of color or the fireworks show is nuts if there was ever an emergency of some sort disney would have a huge problem on their hands they have just gotten out of hand it takes away from the rides and experience all together all in all i love disneyland i probably won t be back during summer though next time i come i will do it during the off season to try and beat some of the crowd size ,5,2015-08-01
3820,A dream fulfilled,the original park and home of enjoyment a dream come true to get to disneyland even if a kidult forever remember the fireworks display above the disney castle beautiful ,4,2015-07-31
3821,Reunion trip..,i would never have gone in july if it had not been for a reunion with my bff from high school i felt the park capacity was way past the danger level does greed trump safety i guess so plus unless you stake out a claim on a piece of sidewalk there is no viewing room to watch the paint the night parade people place clothes towels blankets bags just about anything to save a spot then they are off doing whatever then get all ticked off when they come back and find others are standing too close to their spot it s ludicrous and so not worth the stress and tension if you do choose to go in the summer and during the th celebration i suggest you plan minimum of three days otherwise i doubt you will be able to do even half of the attractions i will return during the off season and after the th good luck to you all ,3,2015-07-30
3822,Best time to go!,i went during the th anniversary i had limited time but i knew it was probably my only chance there are so many special things due to the anniversary celebration i got a chance to see the parades and the shows that i wanted i also was able to visit with characters and go on all the rides i wanted i was by myself so single rider was a great option i stayed all the way through close so i could ride even more rides i highly recommend a couple of days to dedicate to these parks i was only able to go to disneyland but i am hoping to one day come back to visit california adventure ,5,2015-07-29
3823,Will NEVER get tired of this place!,i have been coming to disneyland my whole life since i am only a short hour drive away and my family and i have always been annual pass holders i know people will always say it is too crowded but that is usually when people go during the peak of tourist season summer christmas time new years etc or whenever there s a school break even if you are a tourist and have a couple of kids just take them out of school for a couple days i recommend on a monday tuesday during the slow season and you will have a much better experience we come here as often as we can and i will do the same with my kids in the future can t wait to be back ,5,2015-07-28
3824,Too crowded,we ve been here before and enjoyed it but this trip was a bust most of the lines were hours long it was definitely not worth the price it felt very crowded even the fast pass lines were slow ,3,2015-07-27
3825,Family Vacation,love disneyland is very hectic but well worth it plenty of fun rides for entire family take plenty of water to avoid paying for over priced drinks ,5,2015-07-26
3826,So disappointing compared to Disneyworld,we have been traveling to disney world a lot over the last years as my kids totally love it we just came back from our orlando vacation and because of a business trip to la we had a day to visit disneyland we laughed at how small sleeping beauty s castle is compared to cinderella s really no comparison also everything in disneyland is shot the umbrellas have big discoloration you find trash left in corners park personnel is not as useful and polite as in wdw it honestly felt like an ordinary theme park now indiana jones s ride is great and not existent in wdw but that is about it the other park adventure is nicer and newer but again it lacks the magic tip we parked at the grand californian ballet and walked to the parks not from the inside the hotel it is a very short easy and fun walk and at the end of the day we got back from the internal gate to the hotel and paid for the full day totally worth it in our opinion ,2,2015-07-25
3827,Brings the kid out in you?,it s nice it s cheerful it s fun the parade and fireworks were great yes it s overpriced it s overcrowded there s long lines and it will bankrupt you but seeing the kids faces when they see the disney characters is priceless and of note people on ta who complain that disneyland is much smaller than disneyworld please don t forget about florida s humidity and rain which may not make it the happiest place to visit and the weather at disneyland is usually great and would only go to disneyworld perhaps january to march believe me you will boil ,4,2015-07-24
3828,Enchanted and Fantastic!,there is too much and not enough to say about disneyland recently several couples with new babies asked me when they should take the child to disneyland my answer now disneyland is for parents and children the youngest of infants will have huge eyes looking at all the shapes adults become young and refreshed again dreams are reimagined perhaps you can tell i love and live disneyland go often alone or with friends and family always a treat ,5,2015-07-18
3829,"Set a tradition, repeat, enjoy!",as a california native disneyland has always been a happy place and is obviously in a class of its own thus i won t wax philosophical about the park but i will share some tips and insight i ve gained over the years park in the mickey friends structure prior to living in socal i typically stayed on property so i never really dealt with the parking situation now as a passholder i park in the structure for the tram ride if you park in the toy story lot you ll take a bus to the esplanade the plus is that you re in a lot as opposed to a structure but i m not a fan of cramming into a bus and driving through anaheim streets i like hearing the tram spiel and being out in the open air i ve never had trouble finding my car this is coming from someone who ends up in the lot on the complete opposite side of a mall and it s so well regulated there s an escalator to each floor just take a pic of your floor and row plus right it down to be safe they will try to route you to certain parking areas depending on the expected crowd and avoiding everyone heading to the same place but more often than not you can circle around to where you want to go buy tickets online if you re a passholder it won t be a concern for you but it s so much more convenient to buy tickets and print at home when your ticket is scanned they ll swap the paper for an actual ticket that can be used in the fastpass machines black out dates if you re a passholder and want to get into the park on a black out date the workaround is to renew your pass that day if you sign on the dotted line you ll get a pass good for that day only you can also upgrade your pass if the price difference is the same or more than the cost of a day s ticket they ll give you the same day pass plan ahead unless you ve been to disneyland before it s difficult to gauge how much time you ll want in the park even if this is your first time i would recommend a day hopper at most this isn t disneyworld there are only two parks i also enjoy downtown disney almost as much as the parks so i would budget time outside of the park too it s better to upgrade as you go than have a multiple day hopper you don t end up using overall if you re a ca native definitely use the passholder calendar as a guide for your vacation summer is just packed plus the heat can be rough fall isn t as busy up until the launch of christmas season if you go on the off season it will be a much more pleasant and smooth experience ,4,2015-07-18
3830,Always a fan of anything Disney,we visited on july we are a family of with teenagers the park was open from am to midnight and we were waiting at the gate at am we only had one day for disneyland and we were able to everything we wanted to if you have small children who will be greeting characters and riding dumbo would want to allow two days the park is very compact but has many attractions arrive early as the lines aren t bad until about am i do think minutes was our longest wait all day and that was for peter pan s flight which had just reopened that day we have been to disney world but this was our first trip to disneyland some of the attractions are the same as the magic kingdom but yet slightly different the nighttime parade was so awesome definitely stay for it i will definitely come back to disneyland some day as we love everything disney ,5,2015-07-17
3831,Fun fun fun!,my daughter had such a great time at this park be it at the start of the day or almost midnight it s a park you can spend an entire day at i felt like such a kid here and i ll definitely be back again for all the fun ,5,2015-07-17
3832,Disneyland,had a good time so much to do only got to spend day there which wasn t enough time to do everything only problem was a minute wait in line for a ride but you get that at most theme parks the ride was worth the wait though,4,2015-07-17
3833,Chaming and Classic,for those of you who have visited walt disney world or are visiting as an adult after a long time ago of visiting as a child or an adult visiting for the first time with extremely high expectations prepare to be underwhelmed my husband and i fit those categories and felt this way initially but grew to love this place after being immersed in it s own quaint charm disneyland is in my opinion the epitome of that classic walt disney vision compared to all the disney theme parks those touches create an atmosphere of magic that will leave you nostalgic after you leave ti feel like the prime age to visit is between the ages of but its enjoyable for everyone my month old went on quite a few rides and enjoyed himself as much as our year old though i feel like there are fewer big thrill rides that will excite teens and adults i personally enjoy the classic rides better anyway it takes about days to navigate and explore the park but if you are going during a high peak tourist season i would allow at least days to see all the attractions the park does get quite congested during those peak seasons and can feel claustrophobic in a few areas i wish the walk ways were wider in some parts to alleviate that feeling as far as wait times go if you plan ahead and utilize the fast pass system it definitely goes a lot smoother and can even make a congested summer day bearable overall it s a great place to make memories my year old calls it her favorite place on earth and it is definitely a family favorite we love disneyland ,5,2015-07-17
3834,Fun,we loved it we have children between years old they had a blast had no problem getting on any rides cast members were friendly and helpful ,5,2015-07-16
3835,Nice day although this place is not as good as the Orlando Park.,we visited disneyland as we were in the area and felt that we must visit as this is the original park we didn t find the queues to be as long as the ones in orlando which made the day more bearable on reflection i felt that this park could do a whole lot better and have more rides attractions to match the park in orlando if anything i feel that this park should be superior to orlando the one thing which spoiled the day a little was towards the end of the day we wanted to leave the park at around pm and make our way to the imax cinema just outside the park unfortunately we didn t get out to pm and missed our movie this was due to the disney parade which was going on although this is quite spectacular i was extremely disappointed at not being able to get out of the park and started to feel a little claustraphobic and panicky as there were so many people what made it worse was that the staff in the park kept on directing us different routes to bypass the parade and get out although when we got there the route was blocked and we were advised to go a different way this became most frustrating and the only way i can describe this is disorganised chaos as stated previously there were lots of people and we found ourselves trapped and not able to get out not a very nice feeling this should not of happened and there should always be a way out for people i also understand that there were many annual ticket holders who had arrived to see the fireworks which were cancelled due to a technical error i love disney but after this i am left feeling a little disillusioned ,3,2015-07-16
3836,Emil at Soarin' Over California,why did we listen to cast member emil he unsolicitedly told us the wait time for the single rider line would be as long if not longer than the regular line emil can i please have an hour and a half of my life back we went single rider to test it out after waiting in that horrendously long line and you were very wrong fast passes for the popular rides were gone way to early or you get a fastpass at am for a ride that gives a return time for pm and can t get another friggin fastpass for two hours do they let too many people into the park many regular lines were over minutes do the math that s a lot of boredom for per person ,3,2015-07-16
3837,Smaller Crowds and Great Weather,i lived in california when i was a child and have so many happy memories for disneyland that i had to bring my year old grandson here we loved the weather here compared to disneyworld during the summer and the crowds were much smaller compared to disneyworld loved it and so did my grandson ,5,2015-07-16
3838,Happiest Place on Earth.,it is not cheap but definitely worth your money get a day or more pass for both parks and you get the most value if taking young children plan more than day and head back to motel for afternoon rest a hotel with shuttle is important because even the closet hotel is a long walk for children bring or rent a stroller for any child up to because they will get tired if you want to see characters expect line lineups they will just cut you off whenever it s time for character to leave so beware if you just want glimpses of characters they are near the entrance in main street in the evening and they wander in toon town a lot plan your favourite ride early in the day get fast passes for popular rides car lands has a huge wait but you can lineup before park opens and then rush to get fast pass if you go single riders you can get on rides a lot faster food in park is expensive but you can bring your own food in no one seemed to mind when we did lots of little girls wearing princess costumes take comfortable shoes and bring change of clothes because i saw a lot of tears from uncomfortable kids but you t shirts costumes outside park e tea clothes are good idea if you want to go on rides that will get you wet the parades are very good assign someone in your group to save seats or take turns so you get a good view in front of ice cream parlour on main street is great then you don t have far to walk to leave park sit on corner so you have more room good idea to get the disney california adventure app on phone do you can see the wait times for rides ,5,2015-07-16
3839,"Take the family, it is SO worth it!",what an amazing experience suitable for any age so much fun and so many wonderful things to see polite staff everywhere great food a bit pricey but nothing too outrageous and a genuinely good feel to the place ,4,2015-07-14
3840,Magical Memories every time!,if you have never been disneyland is a must plan for a full day in order to experience most of the park our family will sometimes take a midday break and go back for the parade fireworks and more rides utilize fast passes for the more popular attractions that usually have longer waits ,5,2015-07-14
3841,Get there early for less lines,what a lovely place i think going to disneyland for my st birthday was the best decision i made all day ,5,2015-07-14

3843,How can you not love it? It's Disneyland!,after many years i finally made my first visit to disneyland yes even as an adult disneyland is magical if you aren t into the rides although they re pretty amazing there is so much more to do the shops are great the food is great the mint julips you have to find them and the beignets are amazing the parade and fireworks are nearly life changing the entire visit was so amazing however don t think that you can get it all in one day you really need to make an effort to spend several days there to take most of it in ,5,2015-07-14
3844,Forever Disney!,we have been passholders at disneyland for over ten years i still think it is the most magical park ever built but disney needs to stop and really think about showing some appreciation to their die hard fans prices have tripled over the past ten years that is the only reason for the reduction of one star i am still a fan and there is nothing like returning to disneyland to escape the real world ,4,2015-07-14
3845,Let's talk food,four food tips carnation cafe for breakfast is a great option the apple granola pancakes are a winner the kid s multi grain waffle wasn t the bacon and sausage are average just get the pancakes matterhorn macaroon at the jolly bakery is a unique option we liked the cake better than the topping the pineapple soft serve in adventure land is the first i ve experienced it is great and a must the plaza inn for lunch or dinner is the best food in the park the fried chicken dinner is a winner and it comes with green beans mashed potatoes gravy and a biscuit game set match ,5,2015-07-13
3846,Can't compare to DisneyWorld,while it was nice to go to disneyland nothing beats disneyworld no comparison we were done in hours and the crowds were awful ,3,2015-07-11
3847,Not So Happy at the Happiest Place on Earth,so the day started like you would imagine my husband and i skipping to the sound of all the disney classics and catching our eyes on the characters that shaped our childhoods it was a friday in the summer holidays around degrees celsius and there were american families on vacation aswell as the thousands of international visitors neither of us are massive ride fans so we didn t go on any rides however from what we could gather the average wait for a ride was hour there was little to no shade for a minimum of mins of that wait sometimes all of it and unless you were wearing a strong and water proof sunscreen hat and sunglasses you were sure to be sun burnt the quality and authenticity of the rides however seemed to be of high standards considering how many people used their fast passes to ride multiple times in a row handy hint fast passes have allocated times for specific rides whether you decide to use them or not take note of the times to avoid further waiting the line to purchase fast pass tickets was sometimes as long as the lines to ride as the day went on we became quite lost with the amount of different lands and trails within the park aswell as not knowing the times of any shows or parades it wasn t until i asked a cast member for a copy of the show guide that we were also given a map to navigate ourselves around this eventually became easy and by the end of the day we were able to find what we were looking for easily there is plenty of souvenir shops and old boutique style eateries to accommodate to all wants and needs however we found it really hard to find an inexpensive sit down meal we eventually went with big thunder ranch bbq it was an all you can eat bbq which for us was fine but a little pricey considering neither of us ate much all you can eat by the way means refills of the slaw beans ribs and chicken that you are given to in buckets to share there is no limit to the food refills and the food is all of fine quality we sat down to watch the mickey and the magical map show which even as adults we found to be good the kids around us seem to have enjoyed it and there were guest appearances from characters from the jungle book mulan pocahontas the little mermaid lilo and stitch and the princess and the frog there was plenty of seating all in the shade with ramps and a buggy station for prams for families at the end of the day we sat down to enjoy the parade at the entry of disneyland this was probably one of the best parts all your favourites come out to celebrate through main street usa and this made us zoo excited to come back for the night show we didn t realise this until the day however if you have a one day ticket they actually give you a stamp out and as long as you provide your ticket at reentry they will allow you back in this gave us time to go visit downtown disney and then go home for a quick nap and a freshen up before we returned for the fantasmic show and the evening parade what a disaster we returned to we decided to head in while the first evening parade was happening as we figured we would be able to grab a quick service meal such as a hot dog or something similar however once we stepped inside we were automatically ushered straight through main street usa and through a cast and crew only section which i m guessing is where the parade ends which ended up taking us to tomorrowland and leading us straight into a can of sardines and a major traffic jam people were complaining and poor parents with prams and people in wheelchairs were left idle as they were unable to move around without mowing someone down or injuring themselves it was a complete and utter mess eventually we managed to make our way down to the round about where walt disneys statue is where it became even more of a joke they had sectioned off parts of the park in order to maintain control of the crowd which was an absolute failure on their part as people began to riot and become highly frustrated with the staff and yelling at them to be fare the staff weren t exactly the most helpful of people and instead of giving an explanation as to why we were unable to spread out into the area they just were rude and not understanding as approached we realised that there was going to be fireworks happening and then everyone seemed to calm for a while that was until they put an announcement over the pa stating that tonights fireworks would be cancelled due to technical difficulties well this caused a massive wave of confusion and anger and guests began heading straight for the door or for the staff in order to leave or complain eventually we were able to move around slightly and by this time we decided that maybe we should call it a night once we were back at our hotel we kept an eye out to see if the later fireworks would be on but we did not see them at all even though we had the perfect view from our room ,3,2015-07-11
3848,A Few Tips...,who doesn t love disneyland if possible avoid summer christmas and spring break dates much shorter lines at all of the rides during dinner time or during the parade consider flying in and out of longbeach airport smaller airport with far less hassle and crowds than john wayne or lax ,5,2015-07-10
3849,60th Anniversary is a blast. Great shows and the usual very good rides. Paint the Night is WOW.,so disneyland you go in with high expectations to match the high entry fee yeah the rides are quite good space mountain indiana jones some others are hidden gems thunder mountain railroad rode it times but it s disneyland if you want roller coasters there are better parks but the parades and experiences there s no where else with production value that high the afternoon parade is pretty fun even for a sometimes grumpy dad in his s after a while you re overwhelmed by all these songs and characters you ve known and it s just fun the fireworks show is very very good they s made the castle part of the light show so while it can be a good show in the plaza for it s really good facing the castle fantasmic is bombastic and full of color songs and an attempt at a plot getting a good location can be tricky and small kids should be frightened and the new electrical parade paint the night wow soo much color it s like burning man if the artists had million dollar budgets and family friendly characters truly a fun show tips yay for fast passes use em on long wait rides space indiana jones etc keep em active have someone be a runner and go get them for the area you ll be in a couple hours another tip go on a day when california adventure park has early admission i think the am crowds were smaller on wednesday ,5,2015-07-10
3850,The Happiest Place on Earth,how can you not want to go to the happiest place on earth take in as many rides as you can even the kiddie ones especially the kiddie ones take loads of photos fill up on funnel cakes cotton candy hot dogs fries corn dogs popcorn ice cream overeat overdrink just generally overindulge there s always tomorrowland ,5,2015-07-07
3851,Too many broken rides,i have been to disneyland in anaheim many times and have always enjoyed the experience i am not sure what happened when i visited it last week we firstly visited the haunted house and waited over an hour in line then minutes in the elevator which takes us down to the cars i thought well it is summer and this is to be expected we then found that ride was not the only broken one the tower of terror was nearly a hour wait as of the elevators of were broken space mountain had a longer wait than normal another hour and a half and i saw the theme reoccurring i felt sorry for the parents and children on roger rabbit ride it too has some issues with equipment and times were longer than usual the children behind me in line had waited over an hour and were bored and restless as were other children around me and i am sure their experience was not a positive one i heard their parents complaining and not wanting to return i am not sure if they were having problems in the hot weather or crowds were larger than normal sadly it means that the longer you wait the less rides you are able to particpate on of course there are the express passes but you can only use them within a set timeframe by the the end of the day we were fairly tired and it was a hot day we had decided to visit the california adventure park section and go and eat at the alfresco tasting terrace surprisingly the reception area girl told us the place was full or in their words their commitment compliment had reached optimum quota numbers we were told we could go and try the fast food places opposite firstly if we had wanted that style of food we would not be trying their establishment and secondly its a strange thing to be pushing other places which do not attempt to serve the same style food she did not seem to see the problem finally after explaining our options she offered their restaurant terrace which apparently had not reached the commitment quota compliment as had the downstairs section why was this the last option we happily accepted this as we could choose a glass of wine and have some local cheeses etc we were perplexed as to why this option was last inexperience on her part she had another person working with her who did not say anything to us about it either maybe they were both inexperienced in hospitality as much as i enjoy disneyland this experience was not the best one i have had ,2,2015-07-07
3852,This is the happiest place on Earth!,the rides at disneyland never get old i could go there every year and never tire of it the cast members in the park are always nice and professional i always plan our visits according to a crowd calendar and cooler time of the year and that makes the visit to disneyland all the more pleasant while it is expensive i enjoy shopping at disney and appreciate the photo pass feature and the fun disney photographers one of my favorite vacations ,5,2015-07-04
3853,Disneyland visit,it has been many years since i visited disneyland this time inwas disappointed very crowded expensive food and drinks very long waits fir rides but the kids live it ,3,2015-07-04
3854,"broken rides, crowds",went to disneyland yesterday and it totally missed my expectations there were broken rides everywhere indiana jones barges to the island pirates of the carabean peter pan some would be down for an hour some would be down more went over to the california adventure park and the elevator ride only had one of three elevators working and the crowds if you are going to have broken rides then reduce the number of people entering the park there were a lot of disney characters but those lines were long always the park is getting old and tired they should either get their mechanical act together or reduce the number of tickets available i recommend six flags or another park you get some of the same kind of thrill rides without the high entry cost sad,2,2015-07-02
3855,What a huge disappointment,its sad when you spend that kind of money to take your family to disneyland and its a complete disaster what has become of the friendliest place on earth the cast members were so rude you have to know the minute you even think of applying for a job at disneyland you are going to be working with the public there is no excuse for rudeness my family was yelled at treated like animals and were made to feel like we were an imposition to them and in no way did we feel welcomed ,1,2015-07-02
3856,Truly the happiest place on earth,my sister and i both plus visited the original disneyland when we had a month in usa we went to many placesin our travels but this stop was the one of the most memorable experiences we only booked it originally so we could tell the grandkids we had been but my daughter in law insisted we get a day pass at least as she had been there what great advice could have done or days easily from the moment we arrived it was so fantastic the staff are so happy it filters through to you as well it was like being a child again we didn t know where to look first we actually ran to the teacups ride we did everything on offer had photos with mickey and minnie and every character we came across the daily parade is so cool we were so excited then come nightfall the water show in the lagoon was just spectacular then we proceeded to do it all again the following day we had sore faces from smiling and laughing for days and never wanted to leave do yourself a favour if there is on thing you should treat yourself and your family to in this life its to come to the happiest place on earth you will remember it always we will ,5,2015-06-30
3857,It really is the happiest place on earth,i have been here many times and it is really the happiest place on earth the park is always spotless the staff are alway very helpful and happy the only downside is the waiting on the rides ,5,2015-06-28
3858,"Pricey, poor rides",we are returning visitors to disneyland every time we go to california we visit the park this was our th visit it was however almost to the day years since our previous visit to the park and since then someone in the managment must have given priority to profits over maintenance of the rides prices was higher than ever but i have never experienced so many breakdowns and problems with the rides we experienced several cancellations due to technical problems which is really annoying when you already have spent half and hour in the line in the haunted house it was even worse it broke down while we were inside the ride with an unexpected half hour wait in the basement as a result during our stay in california we have visited disneyland universal studios and six flags two of the three gave value for money disneyland did not don t go there we have been there for the last time ,2,2015-06-28
3859,Magical no matter your age,it s impossible for me to rate disneyland resort lower than five stars though i grumble when they raise ticket prices even in a down economy what the hell is that about and grumble when parking prices go up i ll still happily shell out the money to get my disney loving behind into the park as often as possible being an ap holder definitely has its benefits the discounts small though they may be add up to savings and when you have the ap that includes parking noticing when they raise prices at the lots doesn t hurt quite so much i can t tell you how much i appreciate the kennel club and the fact that they allow you to bring your pooches to the park via the mickey friends tram we drive up from san diego and the bonus of being able to have our dogs close by being able to see them and walk them around between the parks as often as we want is huge my only wish is that they offered some kind of discount or frequent kenneler program or something i mean yeah per dog isn t bad but when you re doing that more than once a month it also adds up i love every attraction in the park as well as all the shops i love the hidden gems and the hidden mickeys that are scattered throughout the different lands even after all these years all these visits i still can t contain my excitement when the tram makes its one and only stop at the front of the resort yes it s expensive stupidly so but it s also an experience that s well it s magical it is there s so much to do to see to eat and to enjoy the classic rides the newer rides the crazy foods the spectacular parades and fireworks and if all else fails find yourself a bench curl up with an ice cream cone and people watch i d bet money you ll see something that ll at least bring a smile to your face ,5,2015-06-27
3860,Hurry up and wait,disney has great customer service great attractions and shows the drawback is the crowds are so large even on a tuesday that you stand in lines the great majority of the day the light show and fireworks show was great however due to the huge lines we were very limited to the number of rides we could take space mountain and california scream roller coaster were great don t waste your time on the matterhorn it is so jerky that it is actually painful nemos submarine ride is a dud the mr lincoln attraction is interesting but parts of it are very dated the tickets are very expensive and even with fast pass the waits are atrocious you can get much more bang for your buck at other southern california theme parks ,2,2015-06-25
3861,Fantasmic Dinner Package,was hard to sit on the ground for so long we did enjoy the show though a few of the rides were not working for a while was a bummer after standing in line for splash mountain for over hr to find out that we could not get on the ride at that time loved the th celebration main street night parade the fireworks ,4,2015-06-24
3862,Family of 15 at Disneyland!,well after treating our family of teens and one year old to disneyland and california adventure i have to say i believe fun was had by all crazy expensive for that many people but i believe a happy memories most of the teens went off by themselves and at times we were lost grandparents my highlight of our visit other than being with family was my husband getting to go up to the wheel house on the paddle boat once only walt disney was able to invite people in now the captain can invite and we got chosen two days were not enough to see and do everything because the lines being so long but we knew that going in really is a magical place we all enjoyed we were lucky to have a wonderful travel agent from wishes family travel sarah mcclure who took care of all our needs for our family trip ,5,2015-06-23
3863,Leaving wanting more,we enjoyed our first visit to disneyland park access was easy from our hotel attractions were all great lines were really long for some rides thank goodness for fastpass walk ways were extremely tight and moving around was an issue more room could have been used biggest complaint is the fantasmic show runs up against the fireworks so you can t see both and you are not permitted to stop to even look at them as you are told to keep moving along ,4,2015-06-23
3864,Trip of a Lifetime,went to disneyland for daughters high school graduation amazing trip and as magical as always wish they had more food vendors around the park get to the park when it first opens to take advantage of slower times until about am we walked on whatever rides we wanted to during those times and walked around without bumping into people use the train for getting around the park it s easier than maneuvering thru crowds memories that will last forever thanks walt ,5,2015-06-21
3865,Memories Will last forever,this was my first time visit to disneyland and had a fantastic time we spent full days in disneyland and day in california adventure this is probably the best way to visit the disneyland resort as you need more then day in disneyland if you are able to plan your day and know your way around the park it is recommended to use the fast pass options available to you have less time waiting in lines and also look at getting a photo pass so you have added memories and not always buying singular rides on photos one price for you entire stay make sure you have a go at everything even if you think it s just a kiddie s ride ,5,2015-06-21
3866,Amazing!,what an incredible place a dream come true everything is amazingly organised beautifully clean and so well maintained and laided out the attention to detail in everything is incredible the rides were great and the queues were nowhere near as bad as we thought they would be we had the disneyland apps on our phones and that was so great for planning where to next the merchandise is everywhere and pricey which was to be expected we still managed to leave with minnie ears t shirts and various souvenirs the evening parade and fireworks display were spectacular and not to be missed the crowds for that were insane but again the disney staff had it all under control so it didn t feel like a too bigger deal ,5,2015-06-21
3867,The Happiest Place in the Universe!!!!,what can be said when so much has been written about this classic this american original it should be on the bucket list of every human in the world no american enterprise has affected so many people in so many positive ways for almost years disneyland has been a treasure to cherish go you ll leave with a smile on your face a song in your heart and a million memories to keep ,5,2015-06-20

3869,Over-crowded And Over-priced,a two day pass with lunches for a family of four set us back over wait times for the more popular rides was about minutes way too crowded and over priced to warrant a return trip ,2,2015-06-18
3870,The classic Disney Park,i have been here times and loved it every time i visited it i like it better than the huge disney world in fl,4,2015-06-15
3871,The Ultimate Disney Adventure,of course being the original disney nothing compares to this it is every childhood memory brought to life you are caught up in the disney magic from the moment you arrive be prepared to walk a lot the park is designed in a fashion that each land has its own area and walking to and from rides can be wearing on the feet once you pay your admission be prepared to pay out big dollars for food and drinks all with disney style all staff members are in disney mode which makes for a day full or fun and memories you will need to stake your claim early if you want to see the evening parade along main street and then move towards sleeping beauty s castle for the evening fireworks which this year due to disney celebrating its th year are even on a grander scale tinkerbell will even make an appearance and fly around the castle as the fireworks display goes off if this is the only amusement park you visit on your trip it will be well worth it it really is a magical kingdom ,5,2015-06-14
3872,They do it well!,the disneyland experience is expensive and when you re buying tickets for a family of you want to make sure you get it right we went with a day park park hopper by about way through day we were sure we d done the right thing we enjoyed having the freedom to return to our hotel in the heat of the day for a swim and rest we were able to experience every ride across both parks some multiple times on day one we were thinking our boys are verging on being too old for disneyland however the place grows on you and the tradition of disney wins some of the rides in disney are exactly as they were years ago making them a little tired and under whelming when we wanted to pick up the pace we d go to the other park for better rides and a more grown up experience the aladdin stage show was great boys loved it the cars ride was awesome and the tower of terror was very exciting both night shows parades were great don t miss them we found some good food was ok although it s expensive we ate twice at the la brea bakery just outside the gate for a good non disney option bring water bottles and snacks for keeping kids happy lines can be long research the fast pass system cause it works a treat ,5,2015-06-14
3873,Amazing but use fast pass and early entry or you wont ride anything!,over day of our holiday was spent queueing for rides at various theme parks disneyland was the worst my advice is to arrive by am and get on any rides you can and get fast passes for others by am fast passes were for pm so dont stay in bed if you want to get on the rides at lunchtime you might as well kick back and go on the kiddy rides or watch shows or go for lunch at this time the park is also boiling and so busy you can barely move even better get a stamp out and go back to your hotel for a siesta then return later for rides while evryones watching parades or heading home it needs to be planned like a military campaign or you will be disappointed now after saying all that disneyland is beautiful brilliant fun and full of smiles and happiness we loved the popular rides like space mountain indiana jones splash mountain food drink prices were high but not as high as paris water is about coke frozen lemonade pizza slice about you can take water and snacks into the park we recommend the pizza place by space mountain w bought a socal citypass that gave us days disney cali adventure day universal day seaworld terrific value a brilliant experience but totally exhausting one final tip when you are too hot and sticky and its degrees go watch the lincoln show in the coldest air conditioned theatre in the park ,4,2015-06-13
3874,Love this place,adults with no children this is my place to go when i truly need to get away first week in june wasn t bad most schools not out so while it was crowded it wasn t unbearable since we tended to leave after fireworks we weren t too impacted by grad nights single rider is a great way to go if you have the opportunity to do magic morning do it even if you hate the idea of setting the alarm we arrived about minutes after it started so we missed the big crowd but the mickey hands greeting down main street was unexpected and just delightful and we had time to do some of the rides that don t have fastpass and that we wouldn t have waited for otherwise we generally didn t want to wait more than minutes we spent about two days total and liked that mostly because it gave us a chance to ride favorite rides again and again and i especially like soaking in the ambience of each land nothing like having a latte and beignets while listening to jazz in new orleans square did the canoe ride for the first time ever and wish i had done it twice don t miss the flag ceremony about pm very inspirational only negative was the unbelievable crowding at the paint the night parade but staff do an amazing job of crowd control i think it s best when you can get out of the i need to ride everything attitude and just sit back and enjoy it the th anniversary decorations especially on the castle are gorgeous and fantasmic the parades and fireworks especially the fireworks are great everyone is so friendly even the visitors i went to celebrate the th anniversary and already can t wait to go back ,5,2015-06-12
3875,Ticked off the bucketlist - an Aussies perspective,i recommend adults get a one day pass with a hooper and for families to get a two day without the hopper adults can get around that little bit quicker and take advantage of single rider lines of you don t mind riding alone families can save some money and take their time in one of the parks at a time got there at am lines were short enough they certainly got busier around you can have a fast pass concurrently for each of the parks don t expect to find anything healthy to eat other than a banana in the park meal options for those looking for something other than a hotdog and lollipop should byo best tip get a fast pass to radiator springs racers as this one was out of fast passes around pm must see at disneyland adventure park disney s aladdin radiator springs racers california screamin must see at disneyland park nothing really went on indiana jones adventure the nemo submarine and space mountain and all were ok i left at pm so can t rate the night festivities checked it off the bucketlist won t be coming back unless i have kids i d certainly recommend for kids ,2,2015-06-11
3876,Excellent family fun,everything will sound cliche but this was a good time i marvelled at the efficiency that the park handled massive crowds fast pass is the way to go on several of the rides space mountain is a classic star tours is fun pirates of the carribean is entertaining no individual ride makes this park spectacular it is the overall experience ,5,2015-06-11
3877,Too many broken rides,we spent three days at disneyland california adventure our first day four of the five rides we were on broke down we had a fast pass for the haunted mansion and had to wait minutes in the fast pass line we waited over half an hour for pirates of the caribbean and the ride shut down just as we approached the boarding area the cast members did not offer any compensation such as a fast pass as is standard practice in disney world the parks were very crowded during the week as the th anniversary celebration was in progress and the park was definitely understaffed never got to ride splash mountain or big thunder mountain as they were continually out of service we had no problems on our prior visit three years ago in early june but we were very disappointed this trip i am giving an average rating vs poor because the nighttime entertainment was outstanding ,3,2015-06-10
3878,A great family vacation,i wasn t going to write a review because honestly either you re willing to spend the money and admittedly it s a lot of money or you re not and it won t matter how little or how much you spent you re either going to love it or you won t i mean it s disneyland for us we went to celebrate our oldest daughter s high school graduation we took three kids all old enough to be independent meaning no constant hand holding no fear of tiny lost children and avoiding the fantasyland rides almost entirely because our older aged kids were more interested in the grown up stuff however i realize that very people have pointed out something that is becoming more and more important in this day and age disneyland is entirely accommodating to guests with food allergies and physical mental and or emotional disabilities they don t advertise this and i believe it s because they probably think to themselves well of course we can accommodate your needs this is the happiest place on earth why wouldn t we cater to your every desire and honestly that s what we got we had the fortunate ability to receive a disability access pass that allowed us to bypass standing in long lines our son is disabled and long lines were the primary reason we considered not visiting until we learned about the possibility of alternative arrangements we still had to wait our turn but without having to actually stand in the line we could enjoy the parks at our leisure because we knew that whenever we were ready we could use our pass to meet our needs for any ride it worked a lot like a fast pass but on every ride not just the fast pass rides if you have a member of your party visiting the park with a disability stop at city hall when you enter the park and speak to a city hall cast member i promise you they will do what they can to best meet your needs you might not get a pass but you will not be overlooked and they will give you help in any way they can more importantly our son has specific diet needs and how surprised were we that you could get a gluten free hamburger bun inside disneyland needless to say he was excited at being able to enjoy a cheeseburger for lunch just like everyone else the chef came out just to take his order and prepared it personally in an area separate from other food prep it isn t a perfect system the kitchen is shared but a separate food prep area helped for sure and our son never had any issues while we were in the park conversely we ate at a restaurant just outside the park and he had an omelet only for us to discover a couple days later that they re made with pancake batter mixed in and it totally explained why he was sick that evening but the food in disneyland never made him ill he had gluten free options presented to him any time we stopped for a meal all we had to do was ask the chefs were completely knowledgeable about what would trigger allergies for instance we were going to order him chili and the chef denied the request because he knew it was not gluten free we totally dodged a bullet thanks to him for the same price of admission as everyone else paid without any extra fees at all whatsoever our son with serious food allergies was able to eat off the same menu as the rest of our family and he never got sick once it was work every penny just to see him that happy and without feeling like he was being singled out ,5,2015-06-10
3879,"A Quick, But memorable trip",if you have a chance to see the paint the night parade do it they ve created this parade especially for the th anniversary diamond celebration of disneyland it reminded me of the starlight parade at disneyland when i was a child it has all your favorite disney characters and every float was mesmerizing mickey closes out the parade and his float is so spectacular i couldn t stop staring tip there are two showings one at pm and one at pm the earlier one starts at small world and ends at city hall opposite direction for pm i personally would recommend the pm one and standing on main street where it connects with the main disney statue roundabout once the parade ends you can fill up the street and watch the new and amazing fireworks show with a perfect view of cinderellas castle ,5,2015-06-10
3880,Fantastic seeing the original disney,having been to disney world florida many times it was fantastic to have the opportunity to visit the original park smaller in size than magic kingdom but that didn t stop you from filling a full day and still not doing everything loved being able to ride the monorail around the outside of the park and back again ,5,2015-06-10
3881,We Loved It!,we spent two days at disneyland with a park hopper ticket so we could come and go as we pleased between disneyland and california adventure park i liked this arrangement as when we got tired of one park we could walk to the other we stayed at the candy cane inn awesome it was walking distance from the park so we were able to arrive when the park opened i highly recommend staying close by as we did not not find the crowds bad at all in the morning quite pleasant we were able to go on any ride we wanted without a fast pass some we were able to walk straight onto with no wait the longest wait for a ride would have been about half an hour which was not bad at all we just went to attraction after attraction whatever we felt like we did notice the park become much busier in the afternoon strange that people arrive so late in the day we left about for a swim in the hotel pool and returned about nice to have a break the park became very crowded hard to move about pm i m guessing people come for fantasmic and the fire works well worth it it did not bother us too much as we loved disneyland said i wanted to move there but agree they could think about limiting the number of people so it is a better experience that would be the only negative for me make sure you wear comfortable shoes my feet got very sore the second day i wish we had longer there so our visit could be more relaxed the rides are out of this world fantastic not just for kids by any means we are a married couple with no kids and i think we enjoyed it more than if we had a cranky kid to push around both parks are worth seeing but california adventure just doesn t have the old school charm of disneyland we will be returning one day and will stay at the same awesome hotel i think it is worth the money but you have to arrive early enough to be able to do the rides without much of a line up had one friend who went there late in the day and avoided doing any rides due to the line ups no wonder she hated it also stay for the fantasmic show and fireworks amazing ,4,2015-06-10
3882,Not the same as it used to be,i love everything disney so i don t like to complain but the park has become very crowded and there is not much of a slow season anymore we are not locals but have had annual passed for a few years we find that when the park stays open til and it s a cold evening the lines become shorter it does seem like the locals have taken it over as mentioned in someone else s review crowded with teens rudely running around with no supervison when we first went it was lots of families and had a much different feel we are going one more time and our passes will expire and won t be renewed makes us sad because it used to be our go to vacation the shows are really high quality and the cast members try hard to help and control crowds but people have gotten so rude lately so it s a difficult job i would say by all means go but be prepared for lines and lots of pushing and crowds everywhere ,4,2015-06-09
3883,Happiest Place on Earth? Really? Can I get whatever drugs you're on?,i haven t been to disney in years i only went because i have a three year old and our family was going the only day we could all attend was a high peak day out of ten crowds and a really hot day after returning and have a few hours to mull it over i ve come to this conclusion unless you re a sadist or have a child i don t understand why you d go there a family member paid for our whole trip lucky us and we were beyond grateful happy so maybe i just feel guilty that he had to pay so much i dunno i did at least hours of solid internet research and looked at every disney secret tips and hacks video out there but no matter how well prepared you are it won t prepare you for the sheer crush of sweaty humanity and the lines ooooooooh the lines insert horror flashback here things that struck me as odd they don t offer double strollers like legoland so you ll have to rent a locker or pack lighter there s not enough shade seems like really poor planning they aren t equipped for the crowds they ran out of first trip and birthday buttons some of the workers seemed like they didn t get the memo they were supposed to be happy nice friendly i m looking at you grumpy ticket lady i was surprised by how dirty some of the bathrooms were again it felt like they weren t prepared for the crowds the iconic pickle popcorn ca cars land you can get only every week or at least that s what i was told why not have it all the time my son loved it s a small world pixar parade ca and meeting the cars in cars land it was a wonderful trip in that regard but the crowds heat are the absolute worst there are so few places that you can take refuge i d do the extra hour drive to legoland almost any day of the week than deal with that circus again they really need to get their act together in terms of crowd control especially for that hefty price tag ,2,2015-06-09
3884,With high prices also comes good quality.,with high prices also comes good quality what theme park manages to take in hundreds of thousands of people daily trample over litter and trash the place and still keep everything looking and smelling brand spanking new for years disneyland has and still does disney is such a quality organization and they do it right in all aspects of their business as a former cast member in the gaming industry i know first hand the many depths that disney goes to be superior to their competitors they make things right for the consumer babying them treating them right making them feel like a kid and surrounding them with bright colorful shiny toys colorful lights lights and more lights spectacular fireworks and entertainment heart touching sounds childhood memories disney characters come to life exciting attractions yummy food you name it disney gets into your brain and right into your heart it s no wonder that billions visit disney every year no matter how much a family may struggle financially they will still manage to take the kids to disneyland at a pop famously known for it s overpriced food disneyland seems to have recently made food items more affordable or at least they seem more normal due to inflation and rightly so with the hundreds of thousands of people that pass through their gates daily at pop entrance fee they make an additional slaughter off food and memorabilia with that also comes great quality if you know where and what to order new orleans has a few must have treats take their lobster roll for example did you even know disneyland had one you can find this tasty treat in new orleans square an affordable must have treat or how about the famous bread bowl clam chowder s media fl yelpcdn com next door at hungry bear you ll also find one of the best funnel cakes you will ever have a sinful treat with just the right crunch smothered in whip cream chocolate and brownies don t forget the fried green tomato sandwich dipped in ranch tdf remember to also stop by the tiki room for a dole whip from hawaii before you leave don t pass up a raspberry coke and cream cheese filled pretzel at the coca cola refreshment corner or how about the best snickerdoodle you will ever have where else can you find one of these sinful magical delicacies hopefully some of these food tips will make for an even more magical day for someone the ultimate disneyland food experience can be found at club if you ever have a chance to go it s a once in a lifetime opportunity for most goals for amazing alcohol concoctions check out catal restaurant in california adventure or crystal cove on top of ariel s grotto ,5,2015-06-09
3885,Busy,been to disneyland multiple times this time was different it was very busy probably due to the th anniversary staff was rude i have never been there and experienced such rude staff food was not so good lines were ridiculous ,4,2015-06-09
3886,Magical,nothing like disneyland to make you feel like a kid again we had so fun but be prepared to walk a lot it s a good idea to go online and check the hours and they can change it was disappointing to find out that one of our days they were closing at but yet you still pay full price for the day shorter hours should mean a discount ,5,2015-06-08
3887,Herded like cattle,we bought sunday evening tickets as part of a conference deal good from until closing the park was jam packed impossible to move in some places the rides are about minutes long but the line ups can be minutes of slowly wending your way back and forth along chain link switchbacks maps are provided but the signage on the ground is terrible no large directional signposts to point towards rides or sections of the park and hardly any staff to ask for help that s until about an hour before the parade starts then they all appear from nowhere in order to herd pedestrians on one side of a white line and to corral parade watchers on the other best things are the star tours ride in tomorrowland minute wait minute ride haunted mansion in new orleans square minutes wait minute event ride and the disney train which circumnavigated the park the fireworks don t always happen and can be canceled if it s windy that happened to us not saying don t go but just be prepared to spend at least four or five times longer in a line than on a ride staff are preternaturally cheery ,3,2015-06-08
3888,Prefer Disney World,i don t think we will be returning anytime soon we booked our trip far in advance before any mention of the hour day disney was less than prepared for the event we arrived at am and by am the place was a zoo we also sadly learned that line cutting is permitted in disneyland one family member is permitted to wait on line while the rest of the family joins later we saw this on many occasions and asked a cast member who said they try and accommodate everyone we asked the cast member to explain that to our year old who was disappointed when she was the cut off point for one of the dumbo cycles the cast member declined perhaps this is a west coast thing where line cutting is ok we don t see this happen on the east coast in the amount we observed at disneyland we even cut our visit a day short because of the poor crowd handling and cast attitude we won t be back anytime soon ,2,2015-06-08
3889,"Always an enjoyable time, even in the rain!",we love coming here this time it was our wedding anniversary everyone had fun helping us celebrate it was cold rain for most of our trip but we still found things to do and now we have nifty ponchos sigh and i got sick and the first aide people were very helpful don t be afraid to ask for help they just want to see you feel better and get back to your vacation thank you disney people ,5,2015-06-05
3890,Walt would be disappointed,i ve been to disney world literally hundreds of times my second hs job was in the magic kingdom and numerous family members have worked there so i m more than familiar with the inner workings of disney properties this was our first trip to walt s original park our kids go to a private school and finished a week before the public schools so we thought we could beat the summer rush and enjoy a couple of relaxing days in the parks boy were we wrong every school in the anaheim area was at disneyland for end of year trips the good the weather was definitely better than florida lots of hotels close to disneyland two miles or less tram ride was very short and parking was easy because the park is so much smaller the bad there are probably half the rides for basically the same ticket price fireworks were cancelled because of high winds the winds weren t bad but i expect this had more to do with the park being landlocked with houses and commercial property all around it crowds for the parades are crazy the park is smaller which means the parade routes are smaller fewer places for people to view incredible crowding two rides in disneyland were completely down two rides at california adventure went down one of which was radiator springs racers which kept going down all day i complained to guest services but they didn t really seem to care they told me that when a ride breaks they give complementary fast pass tickets i explained that this doesn t compensate when you are next in line and the ride breaks a fast pass still ends up being another minute wait for the same ride all in all it s nice to say i ve been here but i ll never come back someone told me that most visitors to disneyland are locals and that s definitely how it felt it was run more like a local hometown park than a major production like the magic kingdom whenever we leave disney world it truly feels like a magical experience unfortunately i can t say the same for disneyland ,2,2015-06-04
3891,Disneyland in a Day!,it s true you could spend several days or a week at disneyland to really experience all it has to offer ride every ride and take in all the shows but not many of us can do that to make the most of your trip download and print maps and show schedules at home in the weeks before your trip have everyone in the family or group mark their must see do for each of the lands in disneyland adventureland tomorrowland etc since you won t be able to ride every ride and see every show in one day at the park make a list of your top activities as a group for each land the day you visit be sure and get an updated schedule with show times this will also have a list of any rides or attractions that are temporarily closed for maintenance next up grab a locker on main street to store jackets and a change of clothes if you re staying late skip the shops on main street for now they stay open an hour after the park closes you ll be able to stop for souvenirs on your way out of the park as you re leaving that ll also save you from having to tote bags around all day and risk the chance of losing your purchases visit the park land by land seeing everything in that land before moving onto the next land one of the biggest mistakes i see people make is to spend the day running from one side of the park to the other this is time consuming and tiring the crowds get larger as the day goes on tempers flare the day heats up and feet start to ache you shouldn t have to literally run from place to place but if you plan right consider show times and mark your map ahead of time you ll be sure see all the things that yore looking forward to while visiting the happiest place on earth ,5,2015-06-03
3892,I felt like the best parent in the world,my husband and i grew up watching disney every sunday night for us going to disneyland had always been a dream but there are no disneylands close to us in new zealand we always knew we wanted to take our children there and we got the opportunity last christmas when we walked in i felt like crying with happiness and over the three days we visited that feeling never went away we loved every second of our time it is an expensive place to visit but can be made cheaper by planning and researching for example decide on your merchandise budget before you arrive so emotion doesn t overwhelm you there are cheaper places to eat within the parks just shop around our children got tired each day so we left the park for a couple of hours in the afternoon to recharge our batteries and eat cheaper food the other thing that amazed us was how late the bulk of visitors arrived each day the park didn t get crowded til am each day by which time we d ridden all the most popular rides with minimal queueing for the rest of the day we relied on fast passes for the most popular rides we also got a map beforehand and made our plan of attack each day before we arrived what order were we going to do the rides in the other really important tip is to get your fast passes for the night time shows as soon as they go our in the mornings look on the map for the locations of these fast pass machines so that you get in the best sections have a wonderful time ,5,2015-05-31
3893,Still the happiest place on earth,even if a ride is closed for the day or one breaks down while you re in line there is always something around the corner to make up for it everyone around you is happy adults act like kids and dress up in costumes and amusing t shirts excited kids are adorable to watch and space mountain is the best ride ever ,5,2015-05-30
3894,Enjoyed the days but disappointed,let me start by saying i am a huge disney mater fan my partner booked this as part of our la holiday i was very disappointed with magic kingdom having been to florida mk which is so much better fantasia in anaheim is fast pass only and nowhere to sit other than the floor in florida it s a purpose built arena much better and no fast pass anaheims second park california adventure land is awesome you really need to get there early to go on radiator springs ride i got to the fp booth at am and the queue was already mins long they ran out of fp by am but the ride is so worth it there is a whole frozen section meet anna else and olaf the holiday trip was worth it just to have my picture taken with mater kids of all ages will love it ,3,2015-05-29
3895,Attention to detail,this was our first time in disneyland i was impressed with the cleanliness of the park even the out of the way places every cast member that s what the employees are called was friendly and helpful however when we left after the fireworks which we could not see well because there were more people than viewing spots we exited the wrong way there were a couple of unlit signs directing people to disney shuttles but there should have been lighted signs directing people to each particular lot disney must understand that many people are at the park for the first time they are tired it s dark and extra help is needed to exit the park and once we found our lot we had to take an escalator to the second floor of the parking structure and walk down to the first floor where our car was parked why because there were no signs directing us how to get there more attention to detail is needed ,3,2015-05-29
3896,"Disney magic, not",great visit to park nothing spectacular but rides are getting old the nemo s submarine leaked and was musty space mountain was well space mountain monorail ride was fun they could use the shady right side route for the parade where you are not sitting waiting in the heat of the day ,4,2015-05-26
3897,The #1 Destination/Attraction in all of California in my opinion,what can you say i ve been to disneyworld in florida about a dozen times and the first time here on a monday and tuesday i prefer disneyland since it s a more compact park easier to walk around in and find what you are looking for you can easily spend or more days here but if you are young and energetic you can see most important things in one day it s a main destination for honeymooners judging by the number of brides grooms you see walking around pirates of the caribbean and haunted mansion are worth the price of the admission better than those in disneyworld a bit different better put together we went on both twice if you have kids from yrs old on up to yrs old be sure to come here not sure if younger kids will appreciate it though helpful hint we stayed at the tropicana inn directly across from the park and it was perfect you just walk across the street to the entrance the ticket office was just a minute walk from the door of our room no need to drive park and then wait for a shuttle to bring you to the entrance ticket office another advantage is that you can enter the park right when it opens and see your favorite rides with only a minute wait or less in the late morning or afternoon there can easily be a minute wait in my first impression here we re entered the park in the early evening and the wait was minutes as well weekday ,5,2015-05-25
3898,Anniversary at Disneyland.,we went for our anniversary my first time at city hall all first timers can get a badge stating first time wearing one lets the staff at dl know they should greet you and congratulate you on your first time through you can also get a badge for your anniversary which causes the staff to greet you with a big happy anniversary i ve been to a few theme amusement parks and there is a huge gap in the attention to detail at dl compared with other parks truly magical ,5,2015-05-23
3899,Enjoyed our time,disney is always fun although we enjoy disneyworld more than disneyland it was convenient though to have the parks right across from each other ,4,2015-05-22
3900,"Still ""The Happiest Place On Earth""",disneyland is still one of the perfect places to take the family to have fun in a clean and safe place it costs much more to enjoy this place than a few years ago two or three day passes are the way to go to save some money try going on a week day not during the summer hit the popular rides early or during the time the parade or fireworks are on getting a fastpass is a great idea you can t go right on in most cases but when you can use the pass you save a lot of time if the line is short at a popular ride grab the fastpass then get in line when you are through with the ride it won t be long until you can ride again relax and enjoy the place every hour or two stop for a short rest ,4,2015-05-21
3901,Plan before you go!,we are just big kids at heart and so decided to return to the fun environment we first enjoyed thirty yeas ago not much has changed except for the queues even outside the school holiday period we found ourselves queuing for up to an hour to see attractions like space mountain and splash mountain haunted house was a short queue there is a system of fast passes which enables you to jump the queues at specific times however we noticed that even people with fast passes were waiting up to minutes for rides the sun shone and we had a good day but we would have liked to have gone on more rides ,3,2015-05-19
3902,Love love love it!,what can i say about disneyland st off i m not in love or nostalgic about it like many southern cali folks i ve been here a few times times now with children and it s an easy good time for them this most recent trip was a little underwhelming because it was way too crowded for our liking we went on a saturday and will not do that again sunday s and middle of the week have worked best for us we re vegan so i wish they had more food options they have some but a full vegan menu without requests and substitutions would be nice ,5,2015-05-19
3903,Family Visit with 2 littles,disney opened late by an hour they did not have any structure to keep people from doing as they please delayed in everything we did and when there was a problem with a locker it put us in another line that cause more delay inwhich it could have been avoided,3,2015-05-18
3904,unorganized release, as an australian traveller with a chinese background and having travelled most of asia i could really appreciate the abundance and convenience of facilities here there are drinking fountains bathrooms seats and food stalls around every corner which was really quite important to us when we went in the middle of summer every now and again they will have float parades great for the kids which spray water on the crowd great for anyone who is dehydrating burning up and the fastpass is your best friend i cannot stress this enough we went around collecting fastpasses the moment we walked in and timed it so that we were always either grabbing a snack taking a short rest break on a ride or walking to the next one we never waited for than a few minutes for a ride the fastpass is the way to do disneyland ,3,2015-05-17
3905,Do your research beforehand and find out which rides offer FastPass,we travelled all the way from sydney australia for my little girls th birthday we had the three day park hopper pass and im sad to say that wasnt enough time for us to see all the attractions we asked the girls if they had a good time and they loved it they could believe they were getting to meet anna and elsa the park its self was amazingly clean i didnt find the souvenirs to be expensive i thought they were rather cheap considering what we pay in australia we packed our own snacks as we found there wasnt very many healthy options the menu we topped our experience off with the world of colour which was amazing we will most certainly be back thanks for making my little girls dreams come true ,5,2015-05-15
3906,An experience fit for my princesses!,we have been to disney world in florida many times and absolutely love it so we thought we would give california s disneyland a try all in all you still get the same fun and wow factor that disney consistently delivers its smaller of course but also a little more intimate more kid rides and easier to go from park to park literally right across from each other we also saw a lot more characters than we usually do which was really fun two big cons for me you have to get fastpasses for all the major rides and shows this takes much more planning and navigating than at other theme parks even with fastpasses to fantasmic we were herded like cattle and the entire process of coming and going to this show was a travesty for everyone involved as perfect as disney usually is at handling large crowds they really need to revamp this system at the fantastic show there build a stadium or something it was really ridiculous and im surprised no one has gotten hurt there were very few signs directing you to attractions and lands we had to rely on the map constantly which is a huge chore with little ones in disney world on the other hand once you have a basic idea you can usually navigate through the park just by using their signs other than these two issues which in my opinion can be easily fixed with very little cost disney land absolutely delivered a magical vacation the attractions were a blast the staff was helpful and the overall feel of the spotlessly clean park was a fun and happy home away from home you definitely need to go enjoy ,5,2015-05-09
3907,Walk in Walt's Footsteps Tour,i went here along time ago in the late s as a child and was in awe the whole day returning as an adult it was pretty much the same experience after going dozens if times to wdw the hardest thing to do was to stop comparing the two yeah they re both disney theme parks but one is enormous and the other is the original the southern california weather adds to the whole experience of having an enjoyable day the lines can get long if you don t go at the slower times of the day year and the food can be pricey but if you want to enjoy yourself just throw it all on the credit card and worry about it later we ve found that it s a whole new experience to visit now that we have a grandchild ,3,2015-05-08
3908,Beautiful Park - So nostalgic and magical!,we arrived to the resort early to take advantage of emh for dca and dp both parks are great and have their own charm and distinction but disneyland had one thing that dca didn t a petting zoo more specifically goats i love goats and right now they have two babies that were born within the last months so adorable it is located in frontierland jamboree area the best part is that every night between and pm that have a little tradition called the running of the goats i was so excited that i begged to see it with the other two girls in my party they run from the petting area back to the barn behind the wooden fence it s only about feet and takes all of about min but women mid s to early s were laughing and smiling like little kids for the rest of the night besides being with my family and enjoying the low crowds throughout the resort and both parks it really was the highlight of the trip we only stayed night but i would see it every night if i could it could never get old for me hoping to return for nights in early mid december to see all the decorations events and activities but really can t wait to see the goats again though in past years they have put reindeer in the area instead to be with santa claus we also saw disney character rabbits roger thumper rabbit from winnie the pooh brer rabbit from song of the south plus pluto with rabbit ears and mickey minnie in springtime clothes the springtime roundup very quiet place and we also saw two young golden retrievers being trained as service animals taking pictures by themselves with the characters so they can get used to interactions and people at the parks most adorable thing i have ever seen best trip ever now to try and convince the girls to plan for december and hopefully not have to big of crowds dec th ,5,2015-05-01
3909,Disneyland Park,my husband and i went here on the th of april it was funtastic we went on a guided tour i highly recommend the tour it was about two and a half hours they show you parts of disneyland and disney s adventure park you also get to go on two rides the guide takes you to the front of the line so no waiting we went to the big thunder ranch bbq it is an all you can eat barbecued chicken and ribs excellent it is a little pricey but well worth it ,5,2015-04-27
3910,"Terrible, skip this Garbage. Go to the Beach instead.",overpriced rude staff and no place to sit ill never go to disneyland again the beach is so much better disneyland is awful everything is do expensive old run down park that needs to be completely renovated with all the millions they are profiting everyday terrible amusement park awful staff awful pricing on everything negative stars ,2,2015-04-27
3911,Must See,we had the best day i have ever had at disneyland i have waited years to see this place and yes it is magical we went on most rides and watched the amazing street parade everyone should add disneyland to their bucket list it doesn t matter on your age as this is truly a magic place for everyone to visit ,5,2015-04-27
3912,Still too underpriced and overcrowded,visited on a saturday and monday non holiday weekend in february and it was simply too crowded to enjoy i would hate to see what it would be like on a holiday weekend battling the hoards of people in order to try and get your money s worth can bring out the worst in us one man called my wife white trash because she had several children with her i guess he was fed up with waiting in line all day too good thing i wasn t present at the moment or i would be writing this review from prison the kids said they would rather go camping than go to disneyland again what a relief ,2,2015-04-23
3913,Pick your days well,i have been a pass holder for disneyland the past two years the park is adorable if you love character interactions and lots of places for photos opps you won t be disappointed the only thing that makes it difficult is trying to find a day when it s not crowded increasingly i ve noticed there are very few days when it is not packed and by packed i mean you can barely move without getting run over by a stroller or rude person make sure to check apps like mousewait and online crowd predictors to plan your trip stay away from any holidays events and days where the city has dance competitions conventions ect it will ruin your trip if you go during one of these times ,2,2015-04-23
3914,Getting too crowded,to be honest we only went here because its an iconic place to go when your in america however it was extremely crowded so many people hitting you with their strollers the stroller parking area was over flooded and you could barely walk around it the lines were huge we were only able to get on a few through the whole day the fire works show was great though,4,2015-04-22
3915,"Very quiet time after Spring Break, no lines",we spent days going between this park and california park and consider them about the same we went when the spring break was essentially over to april and literally had no line ups at all about the longest we waited was minutes for space mountain which is really tame by modern standards the park was spotless as usual the staff helpful and most rides working without issue the food prices are high but not ridiculous and souvenirs not too bad either after visits over the past years it doesn t have the same zing and even the kids need a little more excitement now they are older still saw hundreds of little kids loving every minute of their time in the park the price is very steep but there is only one original disneyland ,4,2015-04-19
3916,Disneyland,fantastic place just research the fast pass procedure before you go to save time with the rides great time had by all highly recommend ,5,2015-04-19
3917,Always kids at heart,disneyland has always been one of my favorite places since i was young our kids are grown now but my husband and i chose to spend our vacation in anaheim and days at disneyland and california adventure be sure to pace yourself no matter how young or almost young you are monday and thursday were good days to go friday was getting too crowded make sure to plan your fast pass activities and we found the single rider options really helped cut the waiting time tremendously ,5,2015-04-18
3918,Grandma Takes 1st Trip to Disneyland,i can t wait to go back we took a family trip to disneyland i was able to enjoy the rides space mountain indiana jones pirates of the caribean haunted house even with my bad neck my daughter put her arm around my neck for space mountain the wait times were never as long as posted they really know how to move people people are very friendly even the first aid office was great new shoes blisters silly grandma they have great healthy snacks fruit yogurt veg on the carts as well as goodies corn dogs churros etc great place for all ages we saw quite a few service dogs also ,5,2015-04-17
3919,Awesome,what s not to like its all there for kids adults it rocks fastpasses are a must go early to beat the mid day crowds you can t lose with this place buy souvenirs off site to save a few ,5,2015-04-15
3920,Recaptured our childhood,a couple of half centurions venturing into kiddie heaven whilst it seemed packed to us staff assured us it was a quiet day wait time for most rides were about minutes except for the popular splash mountain indiana jones which were both over an hour food and drinks are a bit expensive but at least you can get a pass out now if you want to dine in town before continuing your adventure ,4,2015-04-15
3921,Best three days ever!!,we just spent a fabulous three days at disneyland and california adventure park we were there on th march to march which is meant to be a super busy time but for us everything ran smoothly even though there were of us get there early as you will walk straight into park and on some rides we used ridemax and it was very helpful for the first day but after we got our bearings we were ok we also took full advantage of the fast passes and the rider swap as we had a little one with us i found the staff friendly and very helpful and each ride had plenty of staff to usher people along we met all the characters never waiting more than twenty minutes to meet them on the last day we hadn t met cinderella but friendly staff made that possible for us all i did was ask the food in and around the park isn t cheap we booked dinner at goofys kitchen rainforest cafe and ariel s grotto for us it was good to have the reservations as we didn t have to think about where to go and it was great to sit down at the end of the day all in all a perfect three days at disney i can t wait to go back next time to disneyworld ,5,2015-04-14
3922,Kids were almost too old for this - However Hopper Pass for Disney California park helped,i looked for this review when planning this trip this is for those people with older boys as they have so many video games and tech at their finger tips disneyland is iconic for us in new zealand so it was pretty exciting to be there and with the hopper pass to go between the two parks we ended up pretty happy after two days however my year old really only enjoyed limited rides here the year old was interested still in some of the younger rides however after it wasn t enough i think if you had girls there was lots more to keep them happy with fantasyland and all the dress up stuff we made huge use of the fastpass system to book a time slot for later in the day to come back without the queues anything over mins wait we booked a fast pass and came back later however between both parks we had enough to keep them happy and we would move between the two parks using our fastpasses so yes glad we did it some great thrills paradise rollercoaster and splash mountain rate for the year old and it was a fantastic time however days were enough disney cast members are amazing they are always uplifting happy and easy to deal with ,4,2015-04-14
3923,A must do!!!,should have the ap my disney experience simple ap that improved the trip greatly would be easy to implement staff not as friendly as disney world hello princess etc my yr old didn t have same friendly experience no princesses or characters anywhere no one to take photopass pics only got everything required fast pass from a machine lines long just did not compare to disney world ca adventures was better ,4,2015-04-12
3924,"Main Attractions Shut Down, creating long lines 4/08/15",i took both my vacationing teenage grandchildren the matterhorn was down for a scheduled repair went to indiana jones to find it was broken down stood in line hours to ride thunder mountain went to space mountain in line for an hour before it broke down each not the happiest place in orange county i cant even talk the kids into giving it another try ,2,2015-04-10
3925,Disappointed in Disney,after going to disney world in orlando fl the last few times we went to disney we were disappointed with disneyland and california adventure we really felt how small disneyland was also we were surprised at how things just weren t clean the bathrooms were not good at all everyone was helpful and nice per usual disney but we were disappointed and don t feel the need to ever go back to disneyland vs disney world ,3,2015-04-09
3926,Skip 'Land and head for 'World,i was sorely disappointed in our day at disneyland we grew up in california so i have fond memories of disneyland however since living on the east coast and having been to disneyworld now twice i have to hand it to world from the service to the cleanliness to the ride selection the various other things to do in the park the shows parades hands down world wins the castmates seemed bored if you had a question it was hard to find someone to help and there were really very few rides my and yr old wanted to do the castle in the center of the park is nothing in comparison to cinderella s at world i found myself looking around thinking it was dated and kind of sad i m usually so impressed by disney s operations and whole experience ,3,2015-04-06
3927,"Sunshine, Surf, and Fireworks",sunshine and fun to be had at every turn there is plenty to do and see at disneyland park where you can find your favorite disney character park hopper is a must if you want the opportunity to see everything on your own time frame the surf is a short or minute drive to the beaches where you have lots of options to choose from laguna dana point long beach just to name a few every night disneyland has fireworks and a light show its worth a late evening trip to the park ,4,2015-04-05
3928,Disney,was disappointed that rides were closed for spring break matterhorn and splash mountain with that being said everything else was perfect characters cast and employees were all amazing ,4,2015-04-03
3929,visiting as a grandparent.,we brought our sons here over years ago so a lot has changed since then my memories were that back then the emphasis was on the disneyland characters i found this time the rides were the big draw we came here with our son and his wife and their children and great ages for their first time my d i l had been here also twice as a child so some background for all of us adults lots of instructions of course from friends as to one must see this and that my d i l was very smart in putting her day plan together as her main emphasis was on the amount of stimulation the days would be on the children and also what they were capable of doing as in their daughter is not a risk taker which worked fine as neither is her grandmother days was absolutely fine and enough for the of us the important thing to do is to get there early and go immediately to the ride show that was the priority of the day and get a fast pass no charge and are self done pop your pass in the machine choose the event and out pops a pass for each with the hour window in which one can choose to go this takes seconds to do and saves a lot of time in line ups we took bottles of water and snacks with us for rest stops that happened at least twice each morning and afternoon both allowed through at the inspection of backpacks at the main gate by the park in very busy not surprising as the average attendance is day we found the food in the restaurants very good especially compared to years ago the park map shows where the restaurants are and what the menus are also shows where the restrooms are a much needed fact we split up at times during the day doing girl things and boy things the park also has sides the other being disney california adventure included in the main pass when we saw a ride that didn t have a long line up we d go on it our days were from the time we left our rented house at until we got back the parents went back the st night to watch the fireworks and on the nd day we stayed for the parade which was terrific a huge plus to our trip was that we rented a house that was a minute walk from the park knowing that we could go back home to a house and cook our own meals and eat on the patio and play pool and have the quietness after such stimulating days was wonderful we choose to not to take the children back in the eves as they were done all in all a successful family trip and by the end of the second day that was what it was for me time with family working together as a team to make it work sharing laughs and squeals ,4,2015-04-03
3930,Dated & Overcrowded,check the website for closed rides and plan accordingly characters were highly visible and accessible for photos and autographs some cast members were very friendly others had attitudes and not what i expect when i think of the ideal disney experience as a guest the policy regarding people in wheelchairs needs to be revisited there are people who visit that are disabled and genuinely need assistance and then there are others who clearly rent wheelchairs and motorized scooters to take advantage of the system it is pretty frustrating this is not as prevalent at california adventure ,2,2015-04-03
3931,What you expect,a large park and a disney one too make sure you re there for days if you want to cover it all or at least most of it for the older crowd teenage and adults note that there s another disney park on the same location across the children s one the adventure park you can also buy a combined ticket should you choose to go to both on the disneyland park some attractions offer fast pass you can get those passes for free for specific rides those tickets will tell you to come back at a specific time range to pass the regular line you can create a new fast pass ticket every two hours so make sure you start off by checking the rides with this pass and going there first to take a pass and then go every hours to create a new pass to the next ride or the same you want to go to also make sure you take passes to the evening show fantasmic a must see you need a pass for every member of your party check where you can get those inside the park and get them before they end ,3,2015-04-03
3932,Very nice,the first thing that i was pleased by at disneyland was the short lines most rides were minute waits and seldom more than minutes i couldn t believe only a minute wait for star tours the last time i went in when star tours first came out it was a hour wait and they didn t have fastpass back then my husband and daughter had never been to disneyland so they really enjoyed it i enjoyed going back and seeing the old rides i remember as a child although they lost some of their magic there were new rides we tried like buzz lightyear s astro blasters which was fun we were actually able to see all the disneyland rides we wanted to see within one day thanks to the shorter lines which freed up our second day to spend at californian adventure ,4,2015-04-02
3933,getting very expensive,we love dland every year but major rides were closed including our favorites was a bummer currently poo bear splash mountain raging rapids matterhorn were all closed thankfully they had the disney sound parade pixar parade nightly fireworks and extended hours to help ,5,2015-04-01
3934,IT TRULY IS THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH,visited in early march with our kids and grandkids it is not only for kids but adults can have a magic time as well walt disney was truly a visionary when he created this land of fun again fast passes are the way to go get there early to obtain them i think you have to pick the time of the year to visit avoid the peak times as it would be unbearable and the queues monumental a must see is fantasmic and the train ride around the park to get an overall view of the various lands the monorail is good but over before you know it and only seeing minimal views of the park itself more of behind the scenes views would we do it again of course i can see why the locals have annual passes ,5,2015-03-31
3935,The original is always great!!,awesome place where to spend some time you can meet all your favorite disney characters take a tons of pictures and have fun ,5,2015-03-31
3936,Disneyland,we recently visited disneyland and tried the fantasmic dinner package at the blue bayou the cost is per adult and per child for a course meal soft drinks are included but the server didn t tell us though until we asked the food was delicious the best part of the package is the reserved seating area for the fantasmic show not only did we not have to line up for a fastpass or get to the area early to reserve spots we had the best seats in the reserved viewing area the package also includes a cushion for every guest so be sure to ask for it because apparently lots of people didn t get them and or weren t told about it the cushions make a great souvenir if you are watching the first show then be sure to stay behind as the fireworks start almost immediately after the show ,5,2015-03-31
3937,Fantasmic dinner package,the happiest place on earth seems to get a kick out of kicking guests out of common areas every place we went to watch a parade day and fireworks night we were rudely kicked out of they were all common areas that we could not stand in or sit near cast members not as pleasant as they once were curt and unhappy ,4,2015-03-31
3938,not so happy,i had purchased three citypass and on my second evening there i had lost mine the manager that came to the wicket was really not helpful and told me to go to lost and found but never mentioned where it was i did go to lost and found finally feeling very upset and they basically said there was nothing that they could do to help me i told them that i had a copy of the barcode that is on the back of my citypass and they still said that there was nothing that they could do i had already used my citypass at dl and they had taken my photograph so i was really surprised at how unhelpful they were i phone citypass the next day and because i had a photocopy of the barcode and proof of purchase from costco citypass phoned all three places to let them know that i had lost my citypass disneyland then finally gave me my last day ticket universal studio was excellent and just punched in the barcode and i was good to go citypass was awesome and i would definitely use them again pretty disappointed in how disneyland handled the situation after traveling from vancouver bc and spending a lot of money to take my kids there and was treated so poorly ,3,2015-03-31
3939,Enjoyed Disneyland but was disappointed in the Service,disneyland really is the happiest place on earth my first visit to this park all the way from the uk could not have been more magical i felt like a child again nothing can beat your first steps walking down mainstreet usa towards the castle the sweet smell of sugary treats in the air and smiling faces all around you simply amazing ,3,2015-03-30
3940,The Happiest Place on Earth!,disneyland has finally done it for me they have finally prced themselves out of my wallet we ve enjoyed coming here but now with recent price increases and gouging that takes place in the park we are done ,5,2015-03-30
3941,Spring break with kids,disneyland is always fantastic but whatever you do get fast passes for the fantasmic show it s a special kind of fast pass and you can still get fast passes for the rides with it you pick them up at the entrance of frontierland the show starts at pm but get there at pm to snag the front row seats as it is absolutely superb they use pyrotechnics lazer fog and water to create amazing images all over the river of the americas not to be missed ,4,2015-03-30
3942,"If you have a choice, Disneyworld, FL is better",you feel you have to take your kids but you ll feel its not worth it the matterhorn and splash mountain were both closed maybe they needed long repairs but to have those closed over springbreak seemed like exceptionally poor thinking the place was packed and two major rides closed made the lines at everything else almost unbearable times while waiting there were announcements apologizing that the wait was longer than advertised we used the fastpasses but for a family of for three short waits is not worth it at disneyworld once the evening parade is done the park clears out more and you can walk on to most rides not so here still min waits for the couple popular rides they had open take the money you d spend here and invest in disney stock and you ll feel happier ,2,2015-03-27
3943,Good once a year trip,i ve been coming here since i was a kid i see lots of bad reviews on here but the thing about disneyland is that you have to go during the time of year time of week where there are the fewest ppl best to stick to winter and midweek like a wednesday when everyone is in school great rides expensive food good place to feel like a kid again ,4,2015-03-27
3944,the happiest place on earth if you use Fastpass,first tip pre purchase your tickets do not arrive there without them second tip load your fastpasses days prior to your arrival on the disney website create an account and link all of your tickets together you will then be able to quickly use the fastpass kiosks once in the park where you will only be able to get one fastpass at a time but you ll be able to do this for all tickets at the same time if you wish a great time saver ,5,2015-03-27
3945,Tired- over-run and in need a facelift !!!,it took minutes in line and there were only groups of people ahead of us ticket sellers make no effort whatsoever to get people thru really aggravating start ok i come here every years or so every time i visit it seems too many of the big rides are closed matterhorn and indiana jones were both closed this trip i would have thought that the food would have improved but oh no its just as bad as ever really horrible its something that you should see but really the shine has worn off for me oh and the tickets are ,2,2015-03-27
3946,Wrong first impression,we have been disney world many times and wanted to check out disneyland to decide where to take our niece for her th birthday last year we took our other niece for her th birthday to disney world we had a blast but it is so much walking for those little legs we heard california was the place we outta be so we loaded up the plane and we went to see mickey mouse that is so we were walking to the park looking for the first glimpse of the castle always a highlight at disney world well we got all the way in the park and made the turn to main street and was totally underwhelmed by that first look at the castle at that point i knew it wasn t going to be as good as orlando at least i thought as the day went on i noticed how much nicer degrees in anaheim was than in orlando no humidity makes for a lot nicer day then the crowd was much more considerate and understood how lines work by now we had watched a few shows and they too were better the last thing i noticed was how nice the cast was everyone was very nice and helpful i had a question and asked the nicest lady rhoda from that point on she was our personal guide she really made our trip magical and her boss will be informed of what an asset she is to that park there s not enough room to explain on here our other day at the other park was equally enjoyable you have to see the aladdin show genie is hilarious that is the best show at any theme park i ve been to and i ve been to at least different parks the cars ride is a little over rated but nice too so with all that being said i think disneyland is much better for taking smaller children more compact and more comfortable next year we will be making magic with a year old there the last note is that at dw i never want to stay too late because the bus lines get so long we closed the place down at dl i just had a five minute walk to my room we were able to stay through all the fireworks shows and let the crowd slim down before we left that was nice ,5,2015-03-24
3947,A Fantastic Family Experience,we went when the crowds were a little lighter than usual so the general atmosphere was perhaps a little less frantic and so we could really enjoy the experience rather than rushing from fast pass to fast pass but the warmth and professionalism of the people who worked their remained superlative everyone from the show performers the serving staff and through to the ground crew where focussed on making sure that you had the best time possible and i love the diversity of the crowds from high school cheer teams that seemed to take over when we were visiting goth kids star war nerds people of every religion creed and color and families of all sorts big midwestern broods adoptees from other countries same sex couples and there was no friction at all everyone was friendly and respectful of one another taking in and accepting the diversity is such a uniquely american way disneyland really brings out the best in people sometimes ,5,2015-03-24
3948,Same ole Disneyland.,having grown up on the east coast and visited disney world many times i wasn t sure what to expect from disneyland but i was pleasantly surprised some parts of the park were closed for renovations but even so most things seemed to be up and running though the parks are comparable the feel is slightly different disneyland felt slightly smaller and less intimidating maybe because of the areas that were closed but i don t think so and we had surprisingly good luck with getting the fast passes and not having to wait more than minutes for anything our longest wait was for alice in wonderland minutes we were happy to see not only families with young children but people of all ages enjoying the different attractions ,3,2015-03-23
3949,Original Disney,no one really needs to review to go the disneyland what i loved was the fact that i visited the park when i was a child and was able to take my own children and provide them with the same amazing childhood memories my only tips are buy your tickets from arestravel and save some on entry buy snack food at eleven from down the road so you don t have to buy food all day at the park apart from that just soak in the joy and simplicity of this place ,5,2015-03-23
3950,What's not to love??,fun but crowded definitely plan your approach before you go i e know what rides are hardest to get on and how to use fast passes good tip get your hand stamped and go out of the park to eat ,5,2015-03-23
3951,Amazing fun,traveled with a family of four kids aged we bought our tickets parking online and arrived about am wow we spent the the entire day soaking in all the amazing disney fun it was a sunday and someone said they were expecting people that day but we didn t have to wait long for the rides one thing if you re taking kids under age do keep a close eye on them we did see some parents frantically looking for their kids and another boy about walking by himself a person did help him to a park employee we saw the parade fantasmic and fireworks show and they were all excellent ,4,2015-03-21
3952,Check Ride Closures,many big rides are closed as they prepare for the anniversary next year keep that in mind when choosing the time to come all of critter country splash mountain matterhorn and peter pan are currently closed ,5,2015-03-20
3953,Fast Pass or your out!,we went here with my entire family my second disney visit first one is in hongkong this usd attraction is surely great for kids and kids of heart the only thing that pissed me off is this fast pass if you wanted to see a live show in the theater secure a fast pass even you re at first in line but you dont have the fast pass you may still end up standing at the back for they may fill the theater with fast pass holders second for the fantasmic lights fireworks show at secure your fast pass as early as or else you may need to secure a place in the restaurants of course you need to order fast pass is free but they only limited quantity is being issued ,3,2015-03-19
3954,Too crowded to be magical,i ve wanted to go to disney for years and we finally did two rides that stood out were indiana jones and star tours i enjoyed it but the experience was badly dented by the crowds critter land was closed as well as the matterhorn mountain and it felt like the crowds had condensed into the remaining lands we did use fastpass to get on rides but had to wait over minutes on other rides to make things worse space mountain broke down repeatedly during the two days we were at the park twice right at our fast pass times they did accept our fast pass when it started working we managed to get on four rides on each day we were there not enough i really don t think the park is meant for so many people at once is there even a limit on numbers won t be going back the magic has disappeared ,3,2015-03-19
3955,Another Anniversary shared with the Mouse!,and we will do it again for years and years to come always a pleasure disney you rock lunch at the plaza inn is always delicious and hits the spot can t forget caramel popcorn at dca ,5,2015-03-17
3956,Helpful tips for first-time visitors.,i have been travelling to disneyland for a long time now i ve never worked in the park nor have i been a passholder but i ve been to disneyland enough to offer some helpful tips for first timers when to plan your trip there are positives and negatives to going in the off season the best thing about off season is you ll have less people to contend with which means shorter lines and usually happier visitors the negative is this is also the time of year the park repairs its rides and attractions check the following weblink for up to date ride closures http www dlandlive com closures the following is a link for the best dates to stay in https www undercovertourist com blog best time visit disneyland next where to stay if you don t have access to a vehicle you have a number of options available first you can stay at one of the disney hotels which are located on disneyland drive if you stay at the grand californian hotel you have direct access to california adventure park via the back entrances these hotels are quite expensive so if money is not a problem then i would opt for the ultimate disney experience and stay in one of the disney hotels cheaper hotels are on the other side of the park on harbor dr of course the further you head away from disneyland the cheaper the cost most hotels offer shuttles for those a little further out and the ride art bus system is dependable http rideart org when you re pricing out hotels here s a quick tip if you re trying to stay close to the park find out if the hotel charges a parking fee most do and if you don t read the fine print on the hotel website you ll miss an added a night charge on your hotel bill i usually have a vehicle so we stay a few miles out and drive in our last stay was at the anaheim meridian inn and suites in orange i have a review listed on tripadvisor it s only miles away and i detail the route and cost of driving parking vs shuttle usage where to park the best place to park is the toy story parking area they have buses running all day to the park it s faster to park and get on a bus than parking in the garage and waiting for the trams there are less people especially at night and the price is the same a day for in and out privelidges purchase online or at the gate purchase at the gate if you have a cool cashier they may offer you a locals discount tickets are non refundable the tickets are valid until they increase ticket admission which disney does quite often if you cancel your trip and try to come back later you ll have to cover the difference if park admission has increased there s no discount for purchasing tickets online at disney vs buying at the gate remember if you try to get cheap tickets from some other source if it s to good to be true it probably is park hopper passes are the best way to go and tickets are cheaper the more days you stay hotels offer tickets as well the parks download a few disneyland apps to help you with show times and line waits at the park these can help you plan your day accordingly currently the most popular ride is radiator springs racers which is in california adventure if you want to get on this ride and not spend all day in line make sure you hit the gate when the park opens head to the fastpass line which is on the left hand side of the road just prior to bugs land the fastpass will have a line too so here s a tip if you want to ride it twice if you re travelling with others have one person take all the tickets and get fast passes for the group have the group head to the line and the fast pass person can catch up the fast pass kiosk will run out of tickets in about minutes so get there first if you get to the ride line right away you re usually in line for about minutes otherwise you ll be in line for at least hours fastpass you can hold only one fastpass per park at a time once you ve used the fastpass and the time limit is up you can get another one the two parks work independently on the fastpass system so you can have two passes at a time one for disneyland and one for california adventure the fastpasses for world of color and fantasmic don t count as ride passes so get these first thing in the morning the kiosk for world of color is at grizzly river run and fantasmic is at big thunder trail everyone needs their own fastpass except children under they are first come first serve and not every ride has them the longest waits are for the rides with small ride cars based on my experience traveling in both seasons here are my tips for which rides to grab fastpasses for in disneyland space mountain splash mountain and the autopia have very long waits so i would hit these fastpasses up first star tours indiana jones and big thunder mountain have relatively quicker line movement and more to look at while standing there so it doesn t seem to take as long if you don t get a fastpass in california adventure radiator springs racers california screamin twilight zone tower of terror and soarin over california can take a while goofy s sky school isn t really necessary character autographs photo opportunities hands down the best place to get a photo with a character and maybe even some hang out time will be at the character breakfast i ve checked out all three and our best experience was at the plaza inn in disneyland park tigger found us waiting outside with my three year old daughter and he took her by the hand and started jumping with her outside you won t get that kind of service standing in the lines on main st pin trading this is a great opportunity to meet people who trade pins and stories purchase one of the pin trading sets they come with quite a few pins usually doubles so you don t have to purchase a bunch separately they can be quite expensive if you re the quiet type and don t like speaking with strangers some cast members have lanyards or boards with pins on them walk up to a cast member and find out what they have they have to trade so you can pick any pin you want and make a trade evening hours if you take off mid afternoon for some rest head back to the park sometime around pm usually people have been there all day and are leaving the park after about pm tomorrowland clears out and you can ride star tours and space mountain without standing in line for more than minutes the autopia will still take a while to ride even in the evening hours if you want to see the fireworks show highly recommended you need to be on main st at least an hour and an half early you can also see it from frontier land near the rivers of america it s best viewed on main st warning if there are high winds they will cancel the show so make sure you try to see it from the first night you re there fantasmic and the world of color shows fill up fast so if you don t have a fastpass get there early if you plan ahead you can ask a cast member to ride in the wheelhouse of the mark twain river boat it s first come first serve last time i was there this pretty much covers it by no means is this an extensive list of tips but it will get you headed in the right direction have a great time ,5,2015-03-16
3957,Iconic,loved it disneyland seems to do everything right parade was awesome get there at least one hour before on main street to stake out your spot get fast passes to map out your day to fave rides with long lines small world anna elsa buzz light year if you are staying on disney property use your magic morning pass for disneyland not ca adventure bc disneyland is way more crowded you can beat the crowd to the best fast passes magic morning example i used mine to get the anna elsa fast pass and they were almost out of passes when the park opened for everyone else other praises daughter got sick on the ferris wheel ride rocking side threw up on her olaf t shirt and the ride attendant walked her i over to nearest shirt store for a free replacement my daughter was upset embarrassed at having thrown up in front of everyone and this employee basically helped make it all better thank you disneyland ,5,2015-03-14
3958,It's Disney,what more can you say the place is magical and is like all your dreams coming true at once advice get there before opening time and run to the busiest rides that way you can get them done in a couple of hours instead of a couple of hours each you ll have plenty of time for pictures and character meet ups if you do it this way use fastpasses they are a blessing bring bottled drinks as they cost around for something that costs outside the parks try go here at off peak times it will save on queuing times though some rides might be closed the rides to run around to first big thunder mountain pirates of the caribbean space mountain star tours peter pan splash mountain matterhorn,5,2015-03-12
3959,Disappointing,massive let down considering what we expected great for younger kids and families but for teenagers think twice about buying the day pass ,3,2015-03-11
3960,Always fun,disneyland is a great place for people of all ages we have visited through the years with our kids but this was our first trip as empty nesters we had a great time i definitely will plan a return trip ,5,2015-03-08
3961,Fun for the big kids too!,didn t end up going till i was with a couple friends and i think i had more fun than i would have had if i would have gone as a kid such a magical place yes some lineups were long but they were well worth the wait everyone needs to go to disneyland at least once ,5,2015-03-07
3962,Good but lots closed,love disney but give me the orlando park any day on a much smaller scale but it is the original if you are in the la area well worth a visit,3,2015-03-06
3963,love it,just a note to travelers toon town closes earlier than the rest of the park for our visit the rest of the park open until midnight ,4,2015-03-06
3964,Toon Town Closes early,i have been to disneyland park times from the time i was a small child this past time had to be my favourite as an adult a truly brilliant park that brings to life the disney brand and you are submerged in a world of what dreams may come spend a full day there see the shows do a few rides meet the characters see the princesses definitely stay for the fireworks their incredible be prepared to wait if you go in high season use the fast passes their super easy last time i went mid week right before halloween i don t think i would have waited more than mins for anything we booked at the blue bayou restaurant in new orleans square prior to out trip was worth it a little pricey but so good very cool to watch the pirates of the carribean ships go past very romantic yummy food there is also a burger place near critter country hungry bears would recommend that too was super good as for rides i will always star tours space mountain roller coaster in the pitch black unfortunately i was with a gf who was deaf she did not enjoy this at all i loved it indiana jones matterhorn bobsleds and my favourite of all splash mountain you will get wet on the last one so do at the hottest part of the day last time i was really excited for the sleeping beauty castle walkthrough i m still puzzled as to where the entrance was as i never found it be prepared there are alot of children families at disneyland just time yourself well and you can avoid most of the crazy action go early hit the big rides lunch late to avoid rush and all families moving around so much and grab some food between and go early to get into line for shows to ensure a great seat and totally ride the king arthur carrousel and the tea cups enjoy its a fabulous day out ,5,2015-03-05
3965,The Happiest Place in the World!,i wish i could give disneyland stars but there were too many attractions closed on another day i am sure the stars would be earned disneyland is gearing up for its th anniversary and so the castle matterhorn splash mountain and all of critter country and peter pan were closed we knew this prior to arriving but it was still a bummer to have so many big attractions closed my husband and i also noticed a lot of employees seemed to be more lax about their appearance and work ethic than we noticed in prior visits just a lot of employees having side conversations instead of working and some shirts not tucked in or ironed not necessarily a bad thing just something we noticed overall if you have not been to disneyland you should go it is truly a happy fun place something about just walking in makes me smile if you can wait until after may st when all of the closed attractions seem to be reopening ,5,2015-03-03
3966,Happiest Place on Earth,my year old loved our days here and days over at the ca adventure made use of the fast passes and worked our way around the park tip was to watch the fantasmic show one night and then go to toon town another night honestly we had to wait for family near closing to see mickey ,4,2015-03-03
3967,Back again for some Frozen magic,a lot of the rides we wanted to go on were closed the disney character lines were long and then a hostest closed the line has we were about to get an autograph and said back in staff was rude and rides broke down half way through not a magical first family vaca ,5,2015-03-02
3968,Surprised,our rd trip in years this was by far the most disappointing paid full price just to find out that some of our favorite rides were closed down this was in both disneyland and california adventure the castle was covered for renovations the it s a small world was covered for renovations for the nd trip in a row the madderhorn was closed down the whole time so many rides closed the whole trip i didn t know they had times of the year like this i guess the year anniversary is in may so they are fixing everything up for that too shocked we paid full price and only got to enjoy half the park really bummed since we worked for years talking family members into coming with us only to find all this out ,3,2015-03-01
3969,Disneyland some attraction needs prompt repair,i ve been in disneyland in and since it s been years old it was founded in i see many attractions under construction it was not like this until until every attractions perfectly were in operation for instance disney castle rail road matterhorn bobsled splash mountain was not working and were under refurbish in february rail road operated on the third day but disappointingly the dinosaurs went vacation i understand since the years have passed but many people are disappointed in the fact that they cannot enjoy their favorite attractions so please do the maintenance beforehand promptly ,3,2015-02-22
3970,Disneyland Park,disneyland was once a fun place to visit now it will cost you a small fortune to get into the park so you can have the privilege of standing in long lines for the ride attractions and getting mowed down by moms and dads wielding their double and triple wide strollers no thanks,3,2015-02-19
3971,Conflicted,i love the park and have been there over a hundred times but the cost of entry added to the food and hotel costs have made other vacations more desirable basically i can get more for my money elsewhere ,3,2015-02-19
3972,Always the happiest the place on earth,i love disneyland if we had the extra money we d probably go several times a year we usually only make it every few years but this year we re hitting dl ca and we went to disneyworld last summer woo hoo so a couple of tips for planning the day arrive early use the fastpass system and research tips and tricks online beforehand and if you don t know much about disney planning then use touringplans or ridemax to help you avoid waiting in line as much as possible prebook your dining online if you want to go to a sit down place we made the mistake of waiting in line at one of the walk up places for minutes in the blistering heat and it put us both in a bad mood we like to take a break mid day and go to one of the sit down restaurants to recover so we usually hit blue bayou or the wine trattoria at ca you can even look up videos on youtube in advance to help you see how the park is laid out in advance ,5,2015-02-18
3973,Plan Ahead!,disneyland truly is the happiest place on earth bringing out the kid in all of us however going at the wrong time i e during the high season december or july can mean long waits huge crowds and disappointment when rides character greetings and shows need to temporarily shut down or are cancelled for the day where possible plan on coming during the low season and plan your day out of must see attractions and then fit the rest in around it where you can ,5,2015-02-17
3974,Perfect. Can't wait to go back!,walking up the path into disneyland i couldn t believe it this was every kids dream walking out at the end of the day i still couldn t believe it the word magic is overused by disney but i can tell you with certainty that this park is my favourite part of disneyland was great moments with mr lincoln which i am recommending to everyone i see for the rest of my life i am really into politics but even if you re not it is totally worth also space moutain is a thrill seekers dream that s also suitable for kids and splash mountain is one of the funnest rides i ve ever been on the most magical place on earth ,5,2015-02-14
3975,Always a Happy Place,who could have a bad review of the happiest place on earth spent days here one night we did the fantismic and it was great if you purchase the ears that flash in the store in downtown disney then you are part of this show during the week the park closed at pm but that was fine on friday and saturday the park is open until midnight a couple areas closed but that s expected during the off time so they can get it all ready for the full summer season with this year being the th anniversary lots closed due to the fact they are diamonding it up cant wait to go back this was a work trip for my husband as well as a birthday trip for me and also our anniversary lots of smiles and happy birthdays and happy anniversary greeting from the cast members ,5,2015-02-12
3976,Disney looking tires,very expensive but a must do liked much more than california adventures very busy but fast passes are great make sure you get passes for the cars ride early as it s the most popular and they sell out early in the morning,3,2015-02-09
3977,It's Disneyland...,what can you say without sounding like a gushing fanboy i have not experienced anything that approaches its professionalism and showmanship from the headline entertainment and attractions down to the maintenance crew support staff and gate attendants totally professional from top to bottom i m a glass half full type of person so the fact that sleeping beauty s castle and it s a small world were shrouded preparation for the th anniversary celebration starting in may matterhorn and splash mountain were closed undergoing renovation and re engineering and strollers were everywhere didn t cause us consternation we enjoyed what we had and thoroughly loved our february visit were there downsides yeah i suppose the golden horseshoe entertainment offering isn t as good as it once was with billy hill and the hillbillies but on the upside star tours is back with a vengeance new adventures that in one case caused the riders to applaud we visited for two days thursday and friday and thursday was delightful friday had the parked stretched a bit thin with closed down rides overall though it was a great visit ,5,2015-02-09
3978,As must see 😃,we have travelled to disneyland four times in the last years out latest in june and returning again in august to say we are tragic disneyphiles is a understatement disneyland is really the happiest place on earth it s probably epitomises the united states like no other attraction it s sparkling clean all the staff are friendly and it seems no matter how huge the numbers visitors are happy sure it can be expwnsive with food and the never ending gift shops but put that aside and just enjoy one the best of life s experiences oh and the best hotdogs can be found there as well a couple of tips for the newbies accomodation don t stay in the resort itself as it s overpriced there are a number of must cheaper but still comfortable motels out on harbor blvd and and a minute walk to the front gate fastpass available on most major rides in disney and california parks it allows you a gaurenteed quick entrance to a ride in alocated time spot grab one for your favourite rides take a wander to see the sights then back to beat the queues see you back there in august ,5,2015-02-05
3979,Must-See once in your life,smooth operations great entertainment for all need to have the option of ordering alcoholic beverage fastpass and ride share passes are fantastic for families ,5,2015-02-04
3980,Happiest Place on Earth,the park it self had much to offer for family and kids but it was just too crowded there were serpentine queues everywhere and the hour wait for a seconds photo shoot with ana and elsa was the killer in the end the charm is lost and even the spectacular shows and fireworks display cannot obliterate the pin of the long waiting periods ,4,2015-02-03
3981,Good but very crowded,it s called the happiest place on earth for a reason everything is top notch the rides are fun and if you are with people you like standing in lines aren t that bad i love this place ,3,2015-01-31
3982,Best Time Ever,waits and lines just too too too long hours for radiator springs ridiculous several times we were in line for a ride and they closed the ride for one reason or another mike at disney california adventure park slept in so the first show of the day was cancelled really inexcusable especially after you rush there with small children first thing of the day so that you can get more things rides shows done only to find that your rushing there was a complete waste of time and now we had to go rush to somewhere else where the lines were already long they could have easily told us as we entered that the monsters inc show was cancelled rather than telling us exactly how to get there i was very disappointed in disney they have really not kept their eye on the ball and are losing the game we spent of to take this trip and it was not worth k ,5,2015-01-28
3983,Disappointed in Disney,nothing can be described in words about disneyland its just amazing its indeed the happiest place if you have kids and if its accessible don t miss this attractions not to miss here if you are in busy its a small world go at least times full round ride of the tram at night space mountain not for small kids the best and refreshing roller coaster ride toonstown you will find all your kids favorites here fireworks parade,3,2015-01-25
3984,the Best as always,always fantastic too bad it s so expensive i understand the park entrance being expensive but all the food is overpriced don t miss the wonderful live shows mickey and the magical map was a highlight ,5,2015-01-24
3985,Love Disney!,two days in the park worked out well we were there over a weekend so it was very crowded i would recommend planning to visit during weekdays if possible the weather was perfect not too hot this time of year lots of dining options but can be very spendy if you don t plan out your dining carefully many dining options outside of the park too ,5,2015-01-23
3986,Disneyland in January,research told me the slowest week of the year to go it was great as a result do yourself the same favor no ride with more than a minute wait heck yes ,4,2015-01-21
3987,Do your research!,i hear too often that disneyland is too expensive i agree it is pricey but compared to the service cleanliness and atmosphere of other cheaper amusement parks it is by far worth the extra cost if you are staying close by come early and go take the kids home for a short nap in the afternoon make sure to catch the parades and the fireworks notice how many workers are there to help you and your kids at a moment s notice most of all have fun ,4,2015-01-21
3988,Average Disneyland visit due to closures,the park was very busy on saturday and sunday and was made busier due to multiple rides being closed for refurbishment including haunted mansion matterhorn splash mountain and winnie the pooh we were able to have a good time late at night on sunday and early in the morning on monday the rest of the time was way too busy ,3,2015-01-20
3989,It's Great! It's Disney!,much smaller version of disney world but just as magical i liked it better because of the smaller size lines still long but we got there just as they opened so lines were do able the crowd was not bad loved that still expensive that hasn t changed grounds are beautiful and so clean unlike disney world you can see disneyland in a day watching your loved ones have fun is what its all about they will and you will ,5,2015-01-20
3990,Such a fun vacation !,my th trip to disneyland and this time with my daughter her husband and my grandson my grandson is almost and knew which rides he did and didn t want to go on the lines kept moving he asked why we had to go up and down stairs and walk in lines to get to the ride answered crowd control the park is the best at this and makes you feel like you re almost at the ride the only down side is the sandwich i had at the bakery dry turkey meat and bread was pre made and had little flavor disneyland should be able to do better and make up sandwiches as ordered but as my grandson said it s the second happiest place on earth i asked him what was the first he responded home the trip is a wonderful memory ,5,2015-01-20
3991,Time your visit,disneyland is well disneyland everything you think you know or heard about the place are maybe true long lines expensive tickets etc etc but disneyland sure bring joy to my little daughter like no other place can the christmas parade the decoration lights and the fireworks are all memorable but to be fair disneyland is quite pale in comparison with its younger and far bigger sibling in florida if you have visited disney world then disneyland would feel somewhat a downgrade but if you just forget about all that and just enjoy your time being here this place can be one of your and your children s most memorable experience ,5,2015-01-19
3992,Always a good place,our first visit to disneyland was during the christmas season and it was wonderful we have been to disney world in orlando times and we thought it was time to visit the original the park and sister disney california adventure were beautifully decorated what really impressed me was how well they handle lines and crowds we had a four day park hopper thinking that would be enough time but we definitely needed one more day all i can say is wow ,4,2015-01-18
3993,35 Years and just as I remember,october s always an amazing time to visit disneyland not too crowded decked out for halloween and moderate with regard to weather much changes every time i ve visited and this trip was no exception while some of the changes to rides seemed only logical a few others were strangely disappointing the update to space mountain has almost taken it out of my top five i guess i appreciated the feeling of chaos and turbulence the ride used to give it had somehow been diminished by the update for riders with a good memory however an unnecessary stretch of the indiana jones ride has been removed and in my opinion has improved the experience a noticeable change was the staff they seemed rather weary and disinterested in the whole experience this was different than in years past i can t say it couldn t become tedious working there after a while nonetheless it was a departure from prior years in which they seemed genuinely happy to be communicating with their guests i would advise newer visitors to consider avoid using the fast pass in instances their return times are hours later this will limit the number you can hold in a given period thereby forcing you to ride fewer rides also i ve learned the hard way again save sunday for church sunday is never a day to attend disney no matter the time of year no matter the weather you will suffer it seems lately also the food there has been on the uptick for price and in a free fall for quality this is even considering it s designed for mass production my daughter was with me and it goes without saying that the character actors in the park are always very committed to good at what they do their ability to excite and please children of all ages is evident sadly i remember a time when disneyland was a place you could go without a plan without feeling a sense of urgency or of being rushed those days are gone we still have a magical place here just not one that you should visit if you want to relax and get away from it all a strategy in advance is of the essence,4,2015-01-16
3994,Wonderful visit with my adult son!!,went the week before christmas it was okay i was not impressed with the decorations or really our overall visit the kids did not have a great time i am not sure we will actually ever go back we spent way too much money for the kids not to have the time of their lives my year old daughter it was her first time there and we were there for her birthday as well she is a total princess but really didn t care for it i asked if she wanted to go back and she said no way i will spend my money elsewhere ,5,2015-01-14
3995,3 Days in Hell!,if you like long lines high prices and love your kids this is the place for you disney is a great place just too crowded for me and i am originally from nyc the kids did not seem to notice the time spent on lines some hours christmas day was extra crowded and horrible the day before and after just plain horrible but if you love your kids you will do it anyway lol disney staff were great helpful and accommodating when possible if we ever return will have to be mid week and not close to any holidays but we had fun or did we ,5,2015-01-10
3996,"2 expensive, 2 crowded",maybe it is because i am but disneyland has lost it s magic for me for parking and to get in is toooooo much when you have to wait minutes for a ride no discount for seniors we had to walk to and from our car i will not come again ,2,2015-01-10
3997,Happiest place on earth,two adults and two children aged and visited disneyland anaheim for new years eve and for an additional days this is my th time to disneyland at anaheim and in other disneyland s around the world i would still regard disneyland as the best them park in the world the staff are fabulous and well trained they are always smiling and ensuring all people are happy the attention to detail in all aspects of the park is amazing if you can stay at the disneyland hotel that is attached to the park i would recommend this you can gain entry into the park one hour before others and obviously being attached to the park you do not have to walk as far i would recommend the fast pass especially if travelling at a busy time as we did ,5,2015-01-10
3998,FAMILY FUN FOR ALL AGES,this is absolutely the best theme park that my family i have visited there really is no age limit for disneyland the attractions rides shows were absolutely fantastic makes you want to watch all those disney movies again the attention to detail in every aspect of this park was astounding we bought a day park hopper pass which we used in the second week of december and it was just about right to see all of disneyland and california adventure park we were blessed with less than normal crowds on our first day at the park as a result of a slight drizzle and we managed to do almost all of the rides shows and attractions and our teens even had time to repeat a few of their favourite rides disney s fast pass system is free very fair can be used only once every hours and helped us do the busier rides on days that the park was full it doesn t matter what age you are you are bound to love this place loved it ,5,2015-01-09
3999,IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE,yes it was the holidays but it felt like the whole world was at disneyland it was so crowded that it was difficult to walk and queues were super long it was not a pleasant experience ,5,2015-01-08
4000,No crowd control,just spent fabulous days in anaheim with a day flex pass at disneyland california adventure parks our th trip in years we try to go every to years we tried walt disney world in new years and it was a blast so we thought we would try disneyland this time at new years the attraction lines were very long but are very well cued and you don t really notice the time lots to see fantasmic is a must see spectacular special effects mickey s imagination gets away from him for a short time but a great finale we spent new year s eve at the park it was a spectacular show broadcast live over tv but boy was it busy the park hit about capacity according to their index but you would swear it was over capacity people were starting to set up their spots as early as noon so that they could be front and center for the show whenever there is a show on whether it s fantasmic or the fire works or even a parade it is very hard to get around from land to land they have way traffic in and out of each land and not always the way you want to go i do have to say though that the cast members are very friendly it must have been very trying for them during the new years party hats off to the many cast members that worked that night even with how busy it was we still had a fabulous time ,3,2015-01-08
4001,A Magical Experience,wear the best most comfortable shoes you can find leave all the extra stuff in the hotel or a locker and just soak in the history the smells sounds and feelings of a temporary respite from reality ,5,2015-01-07
4002,It's Disneyland!,we love disney and have visited so many times that i cannot keep track of how many times we have visited but this was probably the most disappointing trip the park was fairly full with long lines the parades and the way the employees handled the roping off was beyond annoying at times we felt trapped in certain locations the cast members waving orange sticks were so annoying and confusing i get it some people like the parades but many do not there has got to be a better way or perhaps disneyland is too small to handle a parade there was just no where to walk and after paying for the four of us to get in we felt very ripped off that we couldn t get to where we needed to easily and quickly at one point a lady on one of those carts started screaming literally screaming the disney card meet and greet was a joke minute wait for one character which was minnie mouse we didn t wait and got a pic with minnie later in the day in about minutes ,5,2015-01-05
4003,So sad that I have to give Disney an average vote....,busy but worth the wait for everything when you have children and you go this time of the year it s so much fun,3,2015-01-04
4004,Dreamland fun day,disneyland is a great place to visit previously we had been to disney world several times but recently took our kids to the original in california we took our three children there and all three loved the experience we went between christmas and new years and the park was busy but with the app mousewait we could check the wait times on our favorite rides and plan accordingly which rides to visit this is a place for children of all ages ,5,2015-01-04
4005,Disney Does it Right!,ever since i was a child i have wanted to visit disneyland last september at the age of my dream was finally fulfilled and it did not disappoint i pre purchased my tickets to avoid queuing at the gate but the queues did not look too bad there are many rides available for all ages as expected the thrill rides attract the most people but disneyland have a solution to the long queues and unlike other theme parks they do not charge extra for the privilege there are machines available at selected rides where you put your ticket in and you get a express pass valid for a designated hour a bit later when you return you get to join the express line which puts you well ahead of the general queue there is a wide variety of food available for purchase at reasonable prices and plenty of areas to sit and eat the characters wander around the park and there is no extra charge to have photos taken with them i thoroughly enjoyed my day and cannot wait to visit again ,5,2015-01-03
4006,A childhood fantasy fulfilled,it s disneyland what else needs to be said been there many times starting in and last was in holiday times and weekends it s packed during those times some of the fun goes away due to the crowds best trip we had was many years ago during april it was cold for southern california and rained the place almost literally emptied out being from washington state the weather didn t bother us at all we had the run of it all no lines and at the major attractions we were literally able to stay on and ride again since no one was waiting the only down side was that almost all of the restaurants closed because there were no customers i mean no kidding there was no one in the park or it seemed that way crummy weather winter ish days are the best times to avoid the crush of people ,5,2015-01-03
4007,Dreams come true,we went as a family of visiting from australia over the christmas period the park itself is truly spectacular however the amount of people at the park was absolutely ridiculous if you are planning a trip definitely use the fast pass system we obtained fast passes at am for space mountain which had a return time of pm which will give you an indication of how many people are there there was the option of waiting in the standby queue however the wait was well over hours long we chose to take the fast passes for several rides went back to our accommodation at best western raffles inn and returned later that night beautiful magical place for the whole family that i would highly recommend although would try for a quieter time of the year if possible ,5,2015-01-01
4008,Great,disneyland always will be the ultimate theme park experience that all the other parks aspire to they are always clean efficient and fun all the cast members are always in role and wonderful they ensure the kids have a full magic kingdom experience we waited a bit long for one of the rides in the new cars area but not too long for tower of terror ,5,2015-01-01
4009,Magical but VERY busy!,i have spent my entire life visiting walt disney world in orlando florida and was giddy with excitement at the opportunity to travel to the west coast and visit the original dream it was rainy and cold the entire time we were there which didn t bother me i m used to walking around parks in the rain however californians are not prepared for the rain i was shocked that many of the rides shut down when there s even the slightest drizzle most of the ride ques are outside which might explain why they close mickey s soundsational parade was canceled due to the weather so they announced they would to the main street rainy day parade we sat eagerly on main street waiting for the parade only to see if was literally three cable cars with a random assortment of characters we weren t used to a disney park canceling so many attractions their parks also don t drain water as well as florida and there was a lot of standing water even hours after the rain had stopped and the sun came out other than mother nature s inconvenience this place is great my biggest piece of advice for us frequent wdw guests is to not compare the two disneyland is worlds no pun intended different than wdw but still totally enjoyable they do still have a lot of the original attractions which is nostalgic but a little creepy for example you literally go through hell in mr toad s wild ride my recommendations pirates of the caribbean it s actually better than florida s mickey and the magical map and the nighttime fireworks bring your tissues it s narrated by julie andrews and really beautiful ,4,2015-01-01
4010,Happiest Place on Earth,those that winge about disneyland have not bothered to plan their days it s called being organised grab your ticket use fast pass and your time will be utilised well the staff are very genuine friendly polite and very helpful the park is kept very clean there are many food options and you can locate nice healthy food options it s not that expensive go in with a positive outlook if there are lengthy cues well that s all part of the adventure quicker to wait in them rather than going and building your own theme park ,5,2014-12-30
4011,Disappointed,parksavers com is completely legitimate we purchased days park per day tickets for disneyland and disney adventure park through parksavers com we received our ticket vouchers within hours these vouchers need to be exchanged for tickets at the dl or dca ticket booths savings per ticket is only usd but for a family of that comes up to a sizeable amount we visited dl and dca over dec and had terrific time do read up about fastpass there is plenty of information out there we managed to cover the parks completely with more than one ride on some of the more popular rides it sure helps to download the map and plan the route too ,2,2014-12-26
4012,Best Ticket Deal,our family went to disneyland on to on our last night my wife lost our camera in the crowd she was devastated convinced convinced she had ruined our vacation and christmas christine and gina in the disneyland lost and found department were wonderful it turns out the camera had been turned in merry christmas to the person who turned it in they mailed it back and it arrived christmas eve in time to enjoy the pictures and memories for christmas day thank you ,5,2014-12-26
4013,Thank You and Merry Christmas !!!!!,let me start this by saying i lived in fl as kid and have amazing memories going to dw as a kid we go to dodneyland times per year every year and have for years it s a family tradition we have younger kids but every few years my husband and i do a quick weekend just the two of us the staff is incredible you won t find a grumpy employee it s not allowed and it s so clean despite the mob of people best advice go slow don t ne in a hurry or you will get tired grumpy go in the off season take breaks back at your hotel if you or kids need it and eat at downtown disney not in park other than snacks it truly is the happiest place on earth ,5,2014-12-24
4014,Everyone should experience Disney,disneyland was really awesome my colleagues and i came to california for a business trip and took a weekend to anaheim to visit disneyland both parks we took two days in total and it was worth going the rides were heaps of fun namely the roller coasters which i am super interested in scenery and activities are brilliant and all over quality is really nice the fireworks and laser light show was just truly amazing so so awesome highly recommend visiting disneyland for anyone of any age only downside is that sections of the park close every now and then for renovations filming etc but what can you expect all part of improvement ,5,2014-12-20
4015,A Must Do Experience for all Ages,if you are young or young at heart you will love disneyland i ve seen it grow and change over years it s definitely not what uncle walt had originally there used to be a ticket book and you d only get a couple e tickets e tickets were for the very fast exciting rides there were rarely long lines today you can ride whatever you want just not when you want there are crippling lines for most attractions wait for a couple hours ride the ride for two minutes then get back into another line if you re young maybe all the waiting is worth it but for a senior like me it s not so great ,5,2014-12-17
4016,Are you adolescent?,we took of our boys to disneyland for the holidays we went the monday and tuesday after thanksgiving it was a bit busier than the crowd index said it would be but it was still fun and day it rained all day kind of a bummer but the kids actually enjoyed it and the lines for rides got really short towards the end of the night so they got to ride over and over again without getting off the rides great experience ,3,2014-12-11
4017,Palm Springs and back in a day,what can you say disney is amazing go as an adult and leave the kids behind we just did and strolled around catching all the holiday glitz and glam i would tell you something else but there are disney people all over the web with more info get an app and ask people for tips here at tripadvisor always a trick or two to enjoy the parks the most ,5,2014-12-11
4018,Amazing trip!,my year son loved it his first time my th time at disney you are able to bring in food and snacks ,5,2014-12-11
4019,Amazing and Truly one of The Happiest Places On Earth,disneyland is an absolute must and five stars don t give it justice i do not say this lightly as i was a disneyland skeptic but it was our daughters th birthday and we gave her three choices hawaii iceland or disneyland all relatively easy to fly to from seattle i didn t even get the full dis out of my mouth before she screamed disneyland so that was it we were going to the happiest place on earth sure it is i thought i love my daughter and this trip was her gift for turning double digits which she and we thought was a pretty big deal and worth a grand celebration this is what she wanted and begged for and so this is what we would give her even if we rather have been sitting in a hot spring looking at the northern lights but that s another story not my birthday not my choice we were joined by my year old father college aged stepson my best friend and her year old son so a total of of us my father instilled a love of amusement parks in us early on so i knew he would be game and my bff and stepson both love disneyland and had been quite a few times we on the other hand were dl newbies i had been once ions ago when i was i was swept up literally by the magic that walt created i know it is a terrible cliche but it really is the happiest place on earth adrenaline came over me and i was filled with boundless energy and the joy that my daughter was having and the looks on her face will be carried in my mind and heart for the rest of my life it was priceless we had one of the best times we have ever had as a family and the group of made it even more fun and special we stayed in the park from am until midnight every night except for a short afternoon break back at our room two full days at the park and my friends fit bit clocked us at miles not bad i have become a true disney convert i can t wait to go back and would like to go to disneyworld and disneyland paris and this is coming from from the most skeptical of skeptics about this man made creation of walt disney s i have the utmost respect for him now and feel so grateful that what he created has stood the test of time we arrived the week that they decorated for christmas and if you think it is beautiful at other times of year go when the decorations are up and prepare to be blown away i also loved that the classic rides from were still there and going strong and it made fantasyland my favorite area of the park honestly though the whole place is magical from beginning to end ,5,2014-12-09
4020,"nothing like Disney World, but enjoyable!",let me first say that i am a disney fanatic so i visit disney world as an annual passholder dozens of times each year i ve raised three kids through the magic of disney vacations and to me nothing compares to disney i was on vacation in california so i had to visit disney land anyone that has been to both parks told me that i would be disappointed but i was resolved to go and i m glad i did disney land is the perfect place for families with young kids as it provides everything disney that kids love unfortunately it doesn t provide enough enjoyable activities for adults that i ve become accustomed to at dw even the employees act differently while dw is a place that is impossible to complete in any single vacation dl is worth a few days at best to see it all it definitely did not hold the magic that dw offers but disney is disney and therefore it s well worth the trip ,4,2014-12-09
4021,Kids love it !!,my family and i had a great time at disneyland if you have kids between the age of they will have a time of their lives disneyland has two parks disneyland park and disney california adventure there are many rides to be covered in these two parks i would recommend taking a day each to cover both the parks the long queue for every ride is very annoying you can avoid them to some extent by coming in early ,4,2014-12-08
4022,urgh,this is a really disappointing part of our holiday they really cater towards the younger kids which was a shame as we had been saving to go to disney for years the lines were ridiculous and the amount of screaming children angry parents and fed up employees really made the day long and horrible to meet the characters we were turned away or told to join a massive line for tickets the food was disgusting and overpriced being yelled at by the employees to move when the parade was on was truly a highlight we spent hours here and i was done after about an hour sorry future children i will never go back ,3,2014-12-07
4023,Wonderful,nd visit in years my husband and i visited from sydney australia in for our honeymoon and loved it so much that we promised each other to take our kids when they were old enough we were only able to fulfill the promise this year we were so glad to see the happiness on our children s faces as we had all those years ago disneyland did not dissapoint once again we were there late september and expected there to be long wait times but waited mins for each ride at most i can t say there was anything i didn t like customer service from the employees was fantastic ,4,2014-12-04
4024,Still the King,the standard to which every theme park should try to reach every day there you find another reason to like it it s clean the staff is polite and they make every effort to make your stay interesting and enjoyable don t like where you are walk to a different area of the park there are parts that are getting dated and need refreshing but like i said just walk to another are and you will be satisfied ,5,2014-12-02
4025,The busiest place on Earth!,disneyland is great don t me me wrong but the long lines even if you have a fastpass is ridiculous to me there is no way you can go to more than rides a day in this place however i love the other attractions like the parades the plays in the theaters monorails riverboat etc and just prepare to pay a fortune and to make reservations at the restaurants your best bet for food are the good old hot dogs turkey legs corn on the cob bring a sweater for the evening and comfortable shoes and you are good to go have fun ,4,2014-11-30
4026,Disneyland - Thanksgiving,last time we visited disneyland was in lots of changes since then we were a large group of adults young children teens and grandparents we usually visit disneyworld every year and decided this year to visit disneyland comparing land to world land is so small the wait lines for rides and shows are in the walkways and they are narrow the parks disney and calif adventure were busy on monday nov but attendance dropped off each day thanksgiving day the parks first thing in the morning and early afternoon were not as crowded as on nov disneyland needs to work on assisting their staff to be more customer focused oriented our group had to ask lots of questions about how to move about from ride to ride where to eat etc and the park employees could not answer our questions the usual response given to us was i don t know the grandchildren loved the parks and meet and greets we had a day ticket and enjoyed two days in each park which i feel was a sufficient amount of time to hit all the rides and activities we were there when the park opened and stayed till at night fast passes are needed for the popular rides to avoid waiting in line for an hour or more even meeting the frozen characters ana and elsa require fastpasses ,4,2014-11-29
4027,Hard for the disabled,the park has always been old and pretty narrow making moving through the crowds and turns pretty difficult there are only a few wheelchair ramps per section in the past the only perk for those who have trouble walking or those in a wheelchair was the easy access and shortened waiting periods but recently disney has implanted a new system where the disabled person and all those in her to get a return time on their park ticket each attraction has its own policy and everyone including the cast members are confused this new system has made the disney experience unenjoyable we will not return to the park ,2,2014-11-27
4028,Timeless and Priceless,disneyland continues to be the premier amusement park for families in america they have rides for all people of all ages from thrill rides to rides for toddlers the park is always in great condition and the cast members are all very courteous and they pay attention to the small details i was impressed when i saw a couple of cast members with push brooms and they decorated the brooms with a bow and ribbon for christmas i thought it was pretty amazing that they would get to the level of detail where they would decorate the broom handles they never miss an opportunity to impress the downside of disney is the high costs and the long lines but they have fast passes to help with long lines and they can charge what they want because they own the family entertainment market ,5,2014-11-25
4029,Plaza,breakfast was great plenty of friendly characters coming by to say a big disney hello photo opportunities galore a nice break from the action of main street ,5,2014-11-23
4030,Pay $100 to wait in lines. Sure.,even mid week in november the lines and wait times are a problem i am not a fan of paying to enter a theme park only to stand in lines for so so rides and waters yes it is disney and the kids do love disney but after a few hours even the kids were begging to go back to knott s berry farm this is probably our last trip to disney we will be taking many many trips to knott s where the rides are better the lines are shorter and the entrance fee is less than half oh and if you are a veteran knott s truly honors you with two free admissions ,2,2014-11-19
4031,Happiest Place on Earth!,we love visiting disneyland preferably during the off season times when it s not quite as crowded it really is a fun place with lots to do ,5,2014-11-19
4032,I've been 6 times this year already!!,i am situated in san francisco but love taking my weekends off to spend my long weekends at disneyland its the one place that makes me smile so but and forget the pain or drama i have going on in my life i love all the rides the entertainment but i hate the crowds when i went last time the crowds were so bad the food is so expensive that i tend not to eat there although i usually end up eating at the route diner kids meal for dinner and a coffee muffin in the mornings the admission is overprices too i got the annual pass and for me it was worth every cent had dinner once at blu bayou i d never go back because its very very overpriced and the steak wasn t that good going again this weekend ,4,2014-11-18
4033,Long lines and basically the same rides with a much shorter duration than the wait.,long lines crowded walkways made for a long weekend then to top it off the fireworks were cancelled the characters were only available for short stints then would leave we were hoping for more especially considering the cost ,2,2014-11-18
4034,Bad Timing and Broken Rides :-(,we had a day to spend in la and decided to go to disneyland unfortunately the day we went was a saturday and the start of the holiday season that combined with an upcoming marathon the following day mean that there were an unprecedented number of people there tip choose your timing for a less busy time so we had to wait for a very long time for anything including a table for lunch you can try back in hours and absolute minimum minute waits for rides we waited minutes in line to go on space mountain and were right at the front of the queue only to be told that the ride had broken down and would not be re opening minutes of our lives we will never get back however a useful tip is to make best use of fast passes for rides but then again it was disneyland and you still feel the magic it s a pretty amazing place vast operation that seems to run really well splash mountain and the indiana jones rides were fun try a giant turkey leg for lunch ,3,2014-11-18
4035,New Annual Pass Holder!!,i cannot describe to you how much i have fallen in love with disneyland i have been waiting to get an ap for years yes the rides are mild and less but this is a family amusement park food is pretty expensive but i think they have pretty good food splash mountain front is where you get soaked captain eo is probably gone forever and i m thankful i got to see it several times before the characters are fun to see and take pictures with i highly recommend character dining because they ll spend more time with you and your family i love all of their nighttime shows but beware snag a seat early i tried to by getting there an hour early before show to my dismay it was packed people were already sitting on the floor maybe have someone in your party get a seat and wait or maybe take turns to ride the rides parades aren t that bad come an hour early and you ll have plenty of room to sit on the curbs food is expensive but i always brought lunch from home and so i usually eat dinner there and the occasional snacking the theming of the park is brilliant and it takes me to another world definitely get fastpasses it will save your experience especially for space mountain splash mountain indiana jones and star tours download the disneyland wait times to see how long lines are i did that for a trip and i went on so many rides even twice than i had expected tip if you love disneyland but feel like you can t afford it still come come around pm show usually starts at depends on the month and go through the bag checks and sit in the middle of dl dca and watch the fireworks show for freeeee i see people all the time and some come earlier at least you can still see that disney magic ,5,2014-11-16
4036,Disneyland and California Adventure are the best theme parks!,as someone who never went to disneyland as a child and mistakenly misjudged it as a whole lot of hub bub over nothing let me tell you these theme parks are top notch for a couple of reasons first of all the parks are soooo darn clean i ve never visited a cleaner park and was especially impressed because of the number of visitors how i never saw one scrap of litter next the rides smooth as butter you feel how high quality the rides are compared to other theme parks at least in the bay area the only bumpy one was the matterhorn finally the staff and patrons it really is the happiest place on earth all the staff at rides and throughout the park were so friendly and we never encountered a rude guest it s just a beautiful fun place to go to have a really good time ,5,2014-11-16
4037,Waited all my life to get there and it didn't disappoint,ever since i was a kid growing up with the mickey mouse club and disneyland on the tv i ve wanted to go to disneyland my wife and i finally got there and it did not disappoint absolutely fabulous the level of detail is amazing this is less a theme park than a series of movie sets with rides running through them they even do their best to keep you entertained while waiting in queues not everyone will agree but i liked the mix of totally modern rides star tours indiana jones for example alongside some of the traditional attractions jungle cruise pirates of the caribbean that give a sense of age and maturity to the park the rides are not extreme so out and out thrill seekers are perhaps the only group not well catered for everyone else will be rapt ,5,2014-11-15
4038,Overrated,as a child i went to disneyland with my family i wish i had of left it at that and not gone back again my childhood memories are much better then my new ones the amount of time spent waiting in lines is not cool lines to get into the park lines to buy a drink lines to ride anything and the fact that the day we were there the park was only at a capacity really it was so crowded so i would have hated to be there on a so called busy day i really think they could make visiting disneyland more enjoyable by introducing a system where only so many tickets are sold for the day so instead of having what seemed like many many thousands of people crammed in they could limit numbers to make it more enjoyable for everyone most people buy their tickets prior anyway so its not an impossible task another thing to watch for is the magic morning where you get an extra hour before the park opens it was still manic and after we had queued to go through security then to get into the park for the magic morning we were disappointed to find that most of the park was closed until am apart from tomorrow land where the rides were going they had entrances to other parts roped off strange you would think an extra hour before the park opened would apply to the whole park there is definitely lots to see and do the whole disney thing is a neat idea but the gloss wears off after having to constantly make your way through people to get around not many great photo opportunities without having lots of strangers in your shots the food at the cafe type places where you could buy sandwiches etc was expensive for what you got we enjoyed california adventure park across the way much more we did buy the hopper pass which in hindsight was un necessary as it was easier to stay in one park per day thats just what suited us better though if there is a better disneyland to go to i would go there and not back to this one again ,3,2014-11-09
4039,"Blue Bayou Restaurant, Disneyland Parks, Anaheim, CA",we were excited to make reservations to eat at blue bayou restaurant inside pirates of the caribbean disneyland park we made reservations the day after we reserved our trip we had eaten in california adventure a couple times in the past but we hadn t eaten at blue bayou and heard it is a must due in the disneyland park we were so disappointed first of all we were given the table closest to the door and right by where the server station was at we could hear the servers all talking about their guests and we were as far away from the d cor in the restaurant as was possible we were seated and a female server came up and took our beverage order she said i m just filling in for your server who is on his lunch break he ll be back before long we saw a man lurking around the tables around us taking orders bringing them beverages but he never once came near us the kitchen brought out our food on a tray covered with food warmers and sat it near our table it must have sat there for to minutes before the server came near it to bring to us the busser had even come over and looked at the food and you could tell kind of thought about serving the food but thought better since its the servers job food was pretty good over all we didn t leave hungry but we didn t leave a big tip either we won t eat at that restaurant again next time we go to disneyland parks we ll try another one ,2,2014-11-03
4040,A Haunting Adventure!,biggest price value of the year is the disneyland halloween party terrific atmosphere and so many photo ops easy to get on rides and still have time to enjoy the parade and fireworks the sweets were fabulas and the villians plentiful ten treat stations with several treat carts yeah chocolate can t wait til next year see you there ,5,2014-11-03
4041,Disneyland! The happiest place on earth.,my favorites radiator racer get inline quick or get a fast pass world of colors get your tickets early they run out fast gets you good viewing go at christmas time the christmas decorations trees are awesome check out downtown disney too if you re staying the night it s free to enter the kids will love the lego store check out grand californian hotel s lobby you don t have to be a guest enjoy the pianist the fireplace ,5,2014-11-03
4042,Found my happy place,an absolute must for the young and the young at heart after some years of heartache and hard work going back to uni as a solo mum i saved and saved and managed to bring my kids to disneyland as my our reward i stuck a picture of it on the fridge and we dreamed of it we did it this past september disneyland is truly magical and it has worked its magic on me lets just say this was a much needed holiday the time spent with my children with nothing to worry about but the next ride show food experience is almost indescribable and leaves me teary when i look at our photos i will never never forget the looks on my kids faces sheer joy my shy little yr old girl dancing and twirling on her way out at the end of the night not caring who might see her at many times throughout our visit disney and the cast members just do this so well it has ruined all other theme parks for us as they just don t measure up ,5,2014-11-03
4043,Mickey's Halloween Party,we came to disneyland for a four day visit but i am writing specifically about mickey s halloween party go if you ever get the chance to visit in october tickets cost around and the gets you into the park at pm you are given a wrist band upon entering and those who are not attending start leaving the park at pm it was a great time for all most guests are in costume all sorts of disney star wars and marvel characters many more disney villains are also walking around as well the lines are also much shorter for many attractions aside from the haunted mansion during the halloween party there were numerous trick or treat stations and we received a lot of candy and other snacks during the night the night we attended the party ended at pm but i believe on weekends the park stays open to midnight for the halloween party look forward to attending again sometime in the future ,4,2014-11-02
4044,Its always a must do of course!,i love most of everything disneyland has and if i absolutly had to pick what i disliked about it is that it changes very little but always enjoyable to visit no matter how much the same they have their things one thing i am not afraid to say is that i don t enjoy how the haunted mansion changed into the christmas theme of nightmare before christmas i guess i may be giving power to the idea makers but it does prove how its not a happily ever after and its a reality still i am just saying the change is disapointing ,5,2014-11-01
4045,Disneyland in October-Busier than Expected!,make sure you look at expected occupancy during your stay we thought thursday through monday the second to last week of october would be slow but the park was slammed many rides had much longer wait times of minutes we also experienced several rides malfunctioning as we were next in line once on the matterhorn once on splash mountain and once at goofy s flight school at california adventure it s really worth visiting on monday tuesday or wednesday save time and see much more ,4,2014-10-31
4046,Haunted Tours 10/27/14,spoiler alert don t read this if you want to be surprised the tour info purposely doesn t give you much details so you ll be surprised it costs apiece starts at dusk and lasts hours you get a few sweet treats from the candy kitchen a pretend ghost from the haunted mansion that comes along with you and your tour guide what they don t tell you is you get on rides attractions without standing in lines they re the haunted mansion big thunder railroad mr toad s wild ride and space mountain had we known this we wouldn t have stood in lines earlier for the big rides ,3,2014-10-30
4047,Happiest Place on Earth,what s left to say this is a happy place a place to be a kid and let inhibitions go ride a flying elephant meet a princess stuff yourself on mickey pretzels and dole whips see a short musical wear ridiculous mickey mouse ears listen to a barber shop quartet just enjoy we are frequent disney world vacationers but wanted to see disneyland too we certainly were glad we decided to go there s just something about walking through walt s park ,5,2014-10-28
4048,Not what I remember as a kid.,i am so disappointed as a kid this place ruled we went as adults and i am incredibly let down do not go if you are claustrophobic disney was jam packed with people we only road rides because the rest of the time we were standing in lines or trying to navigate crowds we spent alot of money on tickets for hardly anything giant waste of time and money ,3,2014-10-26
4049,Big disappointment,got a three day hopper pass spent my whole life wanting to go and there is so much crammed in that after a few hundred people gets silly halloween was near so the whole place dressed up and lost the disney appeal if you want to go to disney go to disneyworld in florida as it has more room and a lot better park ,3,2014-10-26
4050,Mickey's Halloween Party,first let me point out that my family and i are annual passholders and go to disneyland almost once a week a few hours at a time this special event is held on certain days in september and october we decided to try mickey s halloween party as a belated birthday celebration for my year old daughter we chose a friday date and paid the full person ticket i had read that disney limits the number of tickets sold and i had my doubts but all three of us had a fantastic time at this special event the longest wait we had was for space mountain and that was only minutes most of the other rides were minutes max the candy lines trick or treating lines were a little long but moved at a decent pace we left disney with almost lbs of candy snickers milky way skittles m m s kit kat etc not cheap candy if you go remember a couple of things the lines into the parking garage are very long and will take you longer then normal to park between are probably the best times for rides most people are lining up and going thru the candly lines so the ride wait times are shorter the special fireworks show is excellent don t miss it ,5,2014-10-24
4051,"Helpful hints/Also Elsa & Anna Sold out within 45mins, be EARLY!",loved our visit i was disappointed that elsa and anna tickets were already gone at am because of the magic morning hour for those of you planning a trip you need to get a virtual standby pass like fastpass for elsa and anna it can be a little bit of a mob scene to get these when the park opens they try to make everyone slowly walk over to elsa and anna s area in fantasyland to begin getting the virtual tickets you are able to see olaf onto of the roof if you stand to the right of the line and look at olaf if you look straight into the house greeting meeting area you ll usually be able to see elsa and anna however if your kid is too young to understand they can t run into the room to say hi and they can t meet them that day at anytime don t do this hit the frozen pre parade instead which you need to grab a seat an hour prior to the pre parade on the curb and stand your ground people plead and beg to let your kid smooth into a seat next to your family sorry lady my kids and i have waited over an hour so they could comfortable sit on the curb to see elsa and anna and all the other disney characters not happening not trying to be mean just saying but disney is disney its wonderful clean magical hit the pre parade to see anna and elsa ride by on a float and don t get your hopes up for the meet and greet but if you get one lucky best place to eat plaza inn end of main street about a meal but good about of food and decent tasting for amusement park food air conditioned and nice sit down buffet styled restaurant don t forget to leave a couple bucks tip for the bussers also they have togo containers for all the food you didn t finish save some money and eat the rest in line later we always do people eat in line all the time don t knock it an hour long wait with the same people in front and behind you can get old sometimes especially when they are eating turkey legs from frontier adventureland and your hungry bathroom for women usually without a long wait the bathroom right behind the plaza or in california adventure in a bugs life world best hotel value price paradise pier is the cheapest and nice enough for disney as a disney hotel guest tho you are allowed to use met amenities at all disney hotels so go visit grand californian or schedule a character breakfast at the disneyland hotel however only paradise pier guarantees mickey to show up for breakfast walk over to the disneyland hotel and take the monorail over to disneyland for magic morning opening instead of walking free nice enjoyable first ride of the day fireworks if you like the fireworks but aren t dead set on them head over to thunder mountain railroad and ride the ride you can see the fireworks as you go in and out of the tunnels and adds to the excitement of the ride plus no waiting you can t see the fireworks all that great in frontierland so its pretty empty i can usually ride it about times in a row before a line begins to form again they make you get out and go all the way around again and then get back on the ride just policy also fantasyland is closed a little prior and during fireworks because of the fireworks make sure you don t schedule to hit fantasyland that time as its not open at that time the infamous dolewhip if you haven t heard of this then you will be curious as to why there is a line wrapping down adventureland that people wait plus for this little permanent stand to sell them pinneapple juice with pineapple icecream dolewhip float because its only found in disney that i a socal resident know of and its amazing heres a hint skip the wait on the outside go into the tiki room area you ll want to see the show anyway and hit the line on the inside sooo much faster plus you might be able to find a seat in the waiting area there to sit down and just have person stand in line they have cup holders you just need to ask for it fast passes you can hold more then one at a time per ticket passholder at a time ways you can hold a fast pass at ca adventure for a ride like screamin over ca and then head over to disney and get a fast pass for space mountain the parks are on separate systems say its noon you get a fast pass for big thunder becuz you really like fireworks and don t want to take my advice its for pm at pm you fastpass releases and you can grab one for star tours if thats pm you can grab another pass at pm for another ride passes do not expire i don t care what the ticket says go to the ride whenever you can want disney cast members don t want to upset guests and hardly ever say anything the worst you get is a slight scold from a cast member who should never do that by the way and then they shrug anklet you in reminding you to be careful of times stuff happens your eating your across in critter country and stuck in a long line for splash mountain just apologize and go in this has only happened to me twice on far separate different occasions but usually by a seemingly year old new employee that turns around to the senior lead and then lets you enter someone just following the rules a little to strictly because its probably their first job and they are new the customer is always right in disneyland so try to plan your day but just try to enjoy yourself we knew going it would be hard to get an anna elsa pass on a magic morning day but we are passholders and my daughter will get to meet them at some point it didn t ruin our day and we enjoyed the happiest place on earth for my daughters first time and definitely not the last premium annual passholder for the second time,4,2014-10-22
4052,Old Folks Trip to Disneyland!,we booked a trip to disneyland because my spouse had never been having grown up in socal i went there several times as a kid so i knew what to expect however at more than years old now i realized i didn t miss disneyland all that much granted it s fun it s disneyland but we got our fill of everything pdq first of all it was over degrees in anaheim that day socal was in the grip of an october heat wave don t go when it s hot just don t by the time we left after hours there our brains were nearly cooked we d already bought hats which were nice hats of course but not because we really wanted to we had to per hat not that bad really i expected to pay more and we ll keep the hats we chose understated colors and minimal designs but the heat was killer i saw a couple of people laid out in the shade at the edges of the walkways with what looked like wet towels over their eyes i was feeling woozy myself especially after riding the matterhorn that ride jolted my old bones really good it was just as fun as i remembered though only way more headache making our first ride of the day indiana jones got stuck halfway through we sat there for minutes and during this time they turned on all the lights talk about ruining the illusion like seeing the club that looks so cool and hip at night in broad daylight tacky grubby and sad they offered us a second ride once we pulled back in to the landing pad and we took it but it wasn t the same we were definitely over it we rode splash mountain pirates of the caribbean and did the haunted mansion that line was really long and really hot we heard not long after that all of those rides had been shut down didn t hear why though maybe the heat was causing problems but we felt good that we got our turn we split a cheeseburger and fries with a really good cupcake and got a soda all for about not too bad in my opinion we worked really hard to avoid dishing out dollars for food there we did splurge on some nice disney sweats to the tune of a pair but we wear sweats and they were nice and it was a vacation so we bought em we did pretty well money wise and actually came home with of the we budgeted i was proud of us long story short we made a memory and i took pics literally they came out great we had a good time til the last ride of the day star tours it s a star wars virtual space shuttle ride and by the end we were both feeling faint i can proudly say we did disney till we were nauseous it was fun and memorable especially if you ve never been but i don t see how families with more than people can manage it really it s expensive and exhausting nothing to complain about though at all disneyland will always be magical ,4,2014-10-20
4053,Poor value,i visited the united states recently on a group tour with my wife and among the places we visited was disneyland it was crowded with waiting times of at least minutes for most rides and we ended up spending most of the time standing in line under the burning hot sun the attractions are quite dull anyway the food places were so crowded that we had to spend so much time queueing and there was no place to sit and have the meal either best to avoid ,3,2014-10-19
4054,Was Cool but disappointing.,we were so excited to come to disneyland we took our kids to disneyworld yrs ago and enjoyed that more we only came because it was the original park we found everything was over priced for what it was wether it be souviners or food lines were long very over crowded and we lined up for some rides for over an hour to get told it was experiencing problems so we d have to wait again i don t think adults with no kids should be allowed a fast past for the kids rides dumbo etc over all we can say as a family of been there done it never again,3,2014-10-14
4055,Magical,we purchased the fast pass tickets from safeway for that included both california adventures and disneyland worth every penny we wee able to use them for several days ,5,2014-10-14
4056,Definitely worth a visit,we were undecided on whether to visit or not but glad we did we had one day so chose to visit disneyland park only and not purchase the park hopper we were staying on hollywood blvd so our hotel assisted with organising a shuttle for us approx each on top of ticket costs the lines were manageable throughout the day and the longest wait time we had was for splash mountain around mins well worth the wait though highly recommend space mountain splash mountain pirates of the caribbean and the indiana jones rides would ve loved some pictures with the princesses etc but lines were quite long and we wanted to do as many rides as possible lots of options for souvenirs or gifts and reasonably priced also definitely worth a visit but would recommend considering staying in anaheim to avoid any traffic delays ,4,2014-10-13
4057,Happiest Place on Earth,the lines were very long and several rides were breaking down which was very disappointing when you waited minutes in line and you get excited about getting on the ride only to find out that it is broken this happened on splash mountain thunder mountain haunted house screamin and indiana jones ,2,2014-10-11
4058,Not as magical as I remember:(,i was lucky enough to go to disneyland quite a bit growing up how ever i have not been in about yrs my husband and daughters have never been it is so different and definitely not magical we waited in line to meet princesses which my yr old never was able to get her picture with we were turned away after waiting for mins saying she is all done be back later days in the park and all that i really noticed was the smell of people smoking marajuana and throw up along the walk ways very sad as fun as the rides are not worth it to me,3,2014-10-11
4059,5th Visit to Original Park + Advice + Halloween Party +DWorld Comparisons,family of visited days sept our kids are almost great ages by the way we have always visited in mid late sept and found favorable weather and lower crowds it was a little bit different this time but we still had so much fun and made great memories the week before we came nd week sept had been in the high s to degrees and i am thinking that pushed some folks to wait and come the week we were there makes sense too hot but it was much more crowded than i remember it in sept past it was still toasty our week but we were there a week and spread out our time instead of cramming into days which i highly recommend if you can do it we had lots of take a park break swim time which was nice too it was our first time at disneyland s halloween party but i will talk about that in a minute i love all the fall d cor at the parks it makes for some great photos i love the size of disneyland we are from pa and also go to the world but this size is wonderful and staying right across the street from downtown disney and the parks is a great perk i kind of like disneyland is not on the new magic band system yet that disneyworld was on when we went last year its a great concept but i think they are still working bugs out and tweaking it so this original system was fine with me we used fastpasses a good bit we had full day and the half day was the halloween party which was good for us if you have never been here before or magic kingdom i would recommend full days though to see it all keep in mind in sept there are no week night fireworks or fantasmic and park hours are shorter if you are on short time or a really busy day here are the things i would try and hit as the others are so so indiana jones this is a disneyland only ride the world doesn t have it although animal kingdom has a similar but not as good dinosaur theme ride jungle cruise classic original and corny but fun adventureland tiki dole whip not sure what it is about this treat but i crave one when i am there very refreshing pirates of caribbean this one is much better here than disneyworld longer with extra little drop big thunder railroad small world annoying but still a fun classic ride and little ones will like storybook boat ride unique to disneyland very cute with all the miniatures matterhorn unique to here as well fun although a little choppy fantasyland i still like this one better than florida as they either never had some of these classic little rides or got rid of them even though dlands castle is much smaller my daughter and i like that you can walk through it tells story of sleeping beauty where as florida cinderella just has a restaurant you have to pay big bucks to eat in space mountain lots of fun the wildest ride this park has i love the ghost images they have at this time for halloween star tours star wars ride haunted mansion this time of year its re done to nightmare before christmas if you like this go i do not i don t see the big deal of this sorry i would rather have a traditional scary mansion and snowman santa which are not meant to be scary i think maybe they should just do this makeover for nov dec than the fall big flop in my opinion splash mountain if you have more time blue bayou expensive we did it this time for st time nice unique as you are inside pirates ride big thunder ranch bbq all you can eat good food entertainment in a fall outdoor decorated scene finding nemo subs they changed it some and we didn t get to see the changes as it opened day we left but hard to get down into for some and very cramped down there unless you have lots of time or a nemo fan you can skip in my opinion winnie the pooh sailing ships railroad monorial mickey s toontown maybe for a first visit or to get autographs or younger kids halloween party this was our first time at this party we have always gone to magic kingdoms this one was similar with the fireworks that i missed as we were in line to space mountain and the parade we missed the headless horseman they had in florida disneyworld also played scary music and this one had music but it didn t seem to set the tone as well you were allowed in at here and i think it was in florida with each party starting hours later now in florida we had always gone sun tues night and this was a friday and their first party of the season which made a big difference i don t know where each place caps off their tickets but this was sold out and with the park being smaller it seemed more crowded than florida in florida we used the party as more of a reduced price more ride time thing as most were in line for candy and you got a lot of rides in with no lines it was not so much the case here although ride lines were shorter there were still waits although we had a good time i think next halloween party will be back in florida or a weekday one here in summary i love the parks of disneyland more than the in florida most of the same rides a few unique ones in parks across the street rather than spread out parks and riding buses we will be back not sure when as the airfare is higher for us and a much longer flight oh and i did not find disneyland empolyees rude compared to florida they were the same friendly helpful people i had in florida thank them smile and the same will be returned to you ,4,2014-10-06
4060,"Lines, lines and more lines",disney are trapped in a nostalgia vacuum where they are no longer seeking to lead the entertainment market rather relive walts glory days by all means keep the tiki room going but balance the historical with some kind of contemporary offering to show this entertainment experience does not only exist in rear view time to embrace the epcot tradition and think not ,2,2014-09-30
4061,So Much Fun,seriously how could you give disneyland a bad review we all went and had a blast it was pretty crowded and there were quite a few people but the longest we waited in a ride line was about min and the rest we flew through or go fast passes for we had a blast ,4,2014-09-26
4062,Photpass +,a great one time price for pictures by the disney photographers though out the park the attraction ride pictures and character dining pictures pre order it online at least days prior to your trip for a good discount other wise ask at the park where to get one this is the plus version your photos are uploaded to the web where you can view them tweak them a bit and so on then order a cd of them again one price plus you get a cd of stock disney pics and a limited use license personal use non commercial look on the web for those poses where the photog asked you to raise your hand up in the air or hold your hand out palm up so cute and of course magical we had one bad experience with a photographer no names and mentioned it to another and he knew right away who it was don t let that stop the fun though if you run into him you will know so just excuse yourself and comeback later when he is not there ,5,2014-09-24
4063,What can one say?,this is disneyland need there be anything else said we stayed on property due to a meeting so convenience came into play so close to everything disneyland offers all together in one place no need to go anywhere else for fun it is disneyland after all the original ,5,2014-09-24
4064,Enjoyed my first visit.,you will never feel so broke and tired and still feel like you never want to leave it really is a magical place work the fast passes and stroller swaps if you have little kids and you will have a great time ,4,2014-09-23
4065,Iconic Park,once upon a time in anaheim we a couple visited the original disneyland to start with you d better have time to spend the whole day in the park otherwise you will not have a chance to see everything we went there around pm and left around am with a short break for lunch it was a long and quite tiring day but we managed to visit of the rides even that some of them had huge lines up to hours our favourite rides were the astro blasters toy story the star tours star wars indiana jones haunted house and pirates of the caribbean in the case of astro blasters you will enjoy the ride which will drive among space creatures you will also be able to shoot them at the same time at the end of the ride you will be surprized to see snapshots of yourself that you can send to your e mail for free star tours amazed us with the design of the waiting area which makes time in line be entertaining if not better than the ride indiana jones ride will be scary and thrilling but still very family friendly there is even cute storage area for your bags right in the ride s car pirates and haunted house will also bring a lot of positive emotions make sure not to miss fantasmic show at the end of the day which will bring you tears of happiness and child memories besides that keep in mind that you need to capture a place in order to have a good view to the show so coming minutes before the show would be wise same thing is related to the parade during day so you will see it from the first line even if we miss disneyland very much we lived happily ever after ,5,2014-09-22
4066,Every kid's and adult's dream!,was a great experience for our two granddaughters stayed at the anaheim rv resort in our fifth wheel just outside of disneyland and used the shuttle that picked us up right at the resort for both shopping and restaurants and also dropped us off each day right at the main entrance to disneyland ,5,2014-09-21
4067,Why wouldn't you,we had to visit here as my teenagers had never been so glad we did my last visit was before my children were born and this was just as much fun if not more so we were lucky enough to get alongside mickey and minnie mouse later in the day and staying on for the evening show was also worth it for the atmosphere we visited on a thursday so although there were still many people there it wasn t as packed as the weekend so less time waiting for rides and not feeling as claustrophobic good to have an agreed meeting point if you get separated from each other also loved the fact that they have lockers where you can store part of your belongings till later in the day ,5,2014-09-20
4068,A Fun Time for All And Person of Size Friendly!,we were at disneyland when my daughter s dance studio was performing there i was a bit nervous as i have a special needs son and his are hidden disabilities i decided not to get the special passes as it all seemed much to difficult and i really did not understand it could just be me the old way seemed much easier and more stream lined so we just went for it the lines were usually about minutes which i found to be just fine the longest line we waited in was for thunder mountain railroad which was over and hour that was way to long even for me a huge plus was that i was able to ride everything with my kids i am not a small lady and i was nervous but i was able to fully enjoy the whole park the only ride that was a slight issue was the matterhorn and even the kids struggled with that one as it sits low to the ground and if you have long legs which i do it is a tight fit but we made it work and it was great i had not been there since i was so it was a joy to get to relive these memories and make new ones with my children while i did not use or need an electric scooter they do offer those at the front i would suggest they have them offered towards the back of the park as well i saw a few people who thought they could make it and could not but to get to the front of the park was way too far so that would be helpful for them we had lots of wind the days we were there so sadly we never got to see the fireworks as they were cancelled each of those days over all it was an amazing trip and we can not wait to go back the staff were all friendly and helpful as well ,5,2014-09-19
4069,The magic lives on,my friend and i first visited disneyland in the s with our families these days we make biennial visits and find the magic hasn t faded after all these years when we re at disneyland we become kids again and the rides take us back to when peter pan alice in wonderland mr toad and a variety of cartoon animals princesses and heroes loomed large in our lives just the clanking of the metal on the rides and the banging of the doors we go through take us back to that magical time this year we were disappointed that the shoulder season we chose didn t offer more relief from the crowding and lines it seems disney simply cuts back the hours so that the lessened number of visitors is crowded into a smaller time period it would be great if the opening time was instead of so people could at least get an earlier start as for magic morning this seems to be so widely distributed now that it s just as crowded as the regular opening hours still this is a wonderful place and there is a comraderie among the people waiting in line since we all want to experience the joy to the two of us we get the best value overall from the pirates of the caribbean ride which really sweeps you away to another time and place for a good long ride with a dreamlike setting and special effects and for childhood nostalgia nothing can beat the starlit peter pan ride also nobody puts on a parade quite the way disney does in all we wouldn t miss it we will back in two years and will try another time of year in hopes of finding that fabled less crowded time ,5,2014-09-19
4070,Let's Become Kids Again,the happiest place on earth i don t know i think my happiest place is my own room but disneyland would have to be a close second the rides aren t all out scary but they hit you with a nostalgic charm that take you back to your childhood i have a theory that disneyland is actually for the parents having witnessed so many tantrum throwing kids perhaps it s more suited for adults parents yearning for yesteryear rather than the short attention spanned kids of today anyways disneyland is a great place that ll require days to completely see and do everything just leave the kids at home they ll be alright with their ipads and computers ,5,2014-09-19
4071,Disneyland is one of a kind.,we had a day here and while it wasn t quite as good as i had expected we still had a great time i am really pleased we didn t go in the height of summer we arrived once the local schools started back the downside is the fireworks aren t on during the week in the off season we arrived at about am and the queues to get in weren t too bad we were also lucky with the queues for rides i think the longest was one that had broken down but the maintenance guys had it up and running within half an hour the other queues were about minutes we found using fastpass really helpful and the app that keeps up to date with the queue wait times i m not really into the shows but we went to one of the mickey mouse ones and it was very good and we enjoyed the parade at the end of the day it is an expensive day so bringing food and drink is good but then you have to carry it around or muck around with lockers we went to california adventure and knott s berry farm the following two days and because we were here for the rides we preferred these ,5,2014-09-18
4072,Got Stuck on Splash Mountain!,we visited disneyland on saturday september with a and year old to celebrate my year old daughter and husbands birthday the weather was degrees and lets just say hot sounds nicer than it felt things i did before visiting researched weather mapped out the rides and show times froze some ice packs for the lunches and bought some disney gear from walmart items i brought to the park with me lunch with drink for everyone lunchables sandwiches and foodles a lot of water dslr camera and backpack double stroller some of the time my kids only want to stand in line and for the parade portable phone charger character sign books lanyards bubbles and froggtogg towels we got there early and parked across the street at one of the hotels and then walked to denny s to eat breakfast i tried to get the kids to eat a big breakfast so they wouldn t be asking for food in the park upon entering the park we went straight to meet anna and elsa but unfortunately by am all the spots were already reserved we pretty much stayed in fantasyland and rode a lot of the rides there we gave the kids bubbles to help them tolerate the lines by pm it was scorching hot so we headed over to mickey and the magical map show sit towards middle it felt good to be in the shade so we decided to take the disney train which has stops around the park after we got to the new orleans stop right before mickey s toontown there was a security concern on the train in front so we would be stopped for an indefinite time we decided to get off the train and ride winnie the pooh it was just too hot so we bought some mickey ice cream each by the way and more water once we got back on the train the kids were hungry so we decided to spend some time in mickey s toontown there is a lot more shade here and lots of places to sit and eat we also decided to re wet the froggtoggs here because they were starting to become dry and hard we visited many of the characters because the park was not as crowded today by pm we were ready to go to the parade but decided to swing by roger rabbits car toon spin the line for this ride was over minutes but looked short from the outside so we hurried over to see the parade and had to stand by it s a small world this came in handy because after the parade we were able to get on the next boat for this ride the kids loved the parade so much we decided to go over to california adventure and watch the pixar parade also tip once you exit disneyland make sure they stamp your hand before heading over to california adventure even if you are not coming back over to disneyland we found seats on a bench near disney jr live and watched the parade with some popcorn unfortunately disney jr live my kids love this show had no more showings so we headed over to muppet d live after the parade we watched a little bit of the live shows and rode a few more rides before heading over to our grand finale of riding ariel s undersea adventure tip make sure to park your stroller at the stroller parking area or one of the employees will move it also we left a lot of items in the stroller and nothing was taken however i do not suggest leaving any valuables in a stroller by pm the kids were tired and worn out so we decided to miss the firework shows and head home i made sure to have more snacks in the car for the trip home we had a great time and i plan to create a flipbook so they can see the changes that occur at disneyland as they age ,3,2014-09-17
4073,A once in a lifetime trip,took my year old daughter in march it truly is the happiest place on earth we saved by bringing our own drinks and snacks loved all the princesses ,4,2014-09-15
4074,Tips for having fun at Disneyland with young children while on a budget,love disneyland have always been more than pleased this trip we were traveling with handicap persons one with a fused leg capable of walking but with some difficulty gets tired and to proud for a wheelchair one with pacemaker and developmentally disabled have cards for proof a new policy has been put in to affect you go get a card from city hall have to tell them what ride you want to ride one at a time after you ride it you have to walk back to a designated area to have you card signed again go back to the ride that was right next to the one you just road wait of course to be expected no problem then walk all the way back to have your card signed for the next ride and back you go all day and night long needless to say this is very difficult for a truly handicap person i ve never felt so discriminated and disappointed like this before mind you we were quietly suggested to rent a wheelchair to avoid this and were told by staff they didn t even agree with there new policy i am a season pass holder am not handicapped and had a blast but my guest from out of state were really put in a not so pleasant situation i understand the misuse of the handicap line by some but for a truly handicap person i hope they change there new policy it s just aweful and quite disrespectful ,4,2014-09-15
4075,disappointment of a year,we came all the way from europe to disneyland cause my year old sons wante to see mickey mouse so so much and me myself have read several disney books where they explain their usiness concept customer service etc we saw mickey that was good son was happy but to be be honest the whole park seems to be out of date we really excpected so much more and most of all customer service s totally avarage i even heard one of the employee talking bad language good that my son doesnt undestand english day before we went to universal studios and folks in disney tehy are really year ahead of you in everypossible way ,2,2014-09-12
4076,Favourite,we loved this park omg disney really know how to do this one impressive point is how interactive the characters are if you have littlies who want to meet and get autographs with all of the characters and there are lots then at disneyland and the california parks they are fantastic so interactive and attentive and although there is a sense that lots of people want a turn they really interact with each child person or group like they really want to chat i know at the parks at gold coast in australia you get a quick snap with not much said and you are moved on really quickly not in disney i was really impressed and the kids especially my yr old daughter she was in awe and as such is a much bigger fan of a lot more of the characters now my daughter did the bibibidi bobbidi boutique princess makeover we did not need to prebook prior walked in booked to go back about an hour later for about she was primped and preened into the princess of her choice incl in the price was the dress wand and crown and a few photos in a carriage etc and she also got to meet a few character princesses eg ariel cinderella snow white considering the dresses were on their own i thought it worked out ok value my yr old son loved the tomorrow land with super heroes such as ironman captain america but also star wars everything is just done so well clearly no expense spared to cover every detail personally i liked the pirates of the caribbean the best amazing spectacle but peter pan although clearly an older ride just so well done but that is just a few so much more to do and see,5,2014-09-12
4077,Happiest Place On Earth!,disneyland is an american institution how can you not visit if you re in southern california all kidding aside disneyland is a must do it s the original park and really just beautiful everything is immaculate the employees are super friendly and helpful almost too friendly and the rides are awesome yes it s expensive but you can spend the entire day there and they still have the old fastpass system which doesn t cost anything despite what you might read hear so you can ride the big ones without much of a wait it s a great place to make memories with your family adults grandparents kids whatever be sure to ride big thunder mountain indiana jones peter pan and haunted mansion do a little shopping on main street eat a mickey premium ice cream sandwich and watch the fireworks head across the street to california adventure if you can but if you can only visit one disneyland is the one to do yes disneyland is smaller than walt disney world but packs in many rides and has a charm all its own you hardly realize you re in the middle of anaheim we don t get to visit here often as we live on the east coast but always have a fun time when we do if you have never been do some research prior to going disney tourist blog touring plans and you won t be disappointed tip the first week of september after labor day is great it was practically empty and we walked on most rides weekdays are the best ,5,2014-09-10
4078,Disappointed,to me and this is only my opinion disneyland is a little overrated it was a very hot day yet there was limited shade where there was shade there were vendors or stores selling stuff we didn t have any kids with us so that may have made a difference but for for a one day pass not worth it ,2,2014-09-09
4079,wow its killer expensive,disney will figure out a way to charge you for breathing disney air they are a corporate juggernaut its basically to walk in all that aside we had fun the park is immaculate as always nothing needs a coat of paint or to be dusted they are on it i will say for what its worth i thought the security was lacking large groups a rowdy teens young adults gang tattoos large groups bad language pushing that was just the women almost go into a fight with intoxicated asian teen after he and his group ran me and my wife over as they sprinted about the area this went on for mins or so plenty of time for disney pd to respond i was disappointed to say the least the times they are a changing and not for the better ,4,2014-09-08
4080,Water anyone?,recently spent three days visiting disneyland and california adventure with my daughter and some friends it s been about six years since our last visit and a few things have changed besides new rides and attractions there were definitely a wider range of healthier menu items more whole fruit and vegetables but still tons of junk food too but most disappointing was the lack of fresh water refill stations as in there was not a single one we were told that we could go up to the restaurant counters and ask for a cup of water and that we could get them free except when they are served in plastic cups they re not really free everyone in our group had their own reusable water bottles so we took those plastic cups and poured the water into our bottles and in less than a minute we had contributed to the plastic waste mountain of garbage disneyland generates every day why doesn t disney go green sell resusable water bottles make the personalized like your hats and then have water refilling stations throughout the park the water doesn t have to be free make them vending machines so your food beverage profits don t really have to suffer and hey the technology is already out there ,3,2014-09-07
4081,As Great As Ever,i just spent three days at disneyland california adventure with a and year old and we all had a great time the parks are as clean as ever and the offerings for children have increased the royal theater is a great place for kids to see a different take on their favorite fairy tales over in california adventure the crush talk and the disney junior live on stage are wonderful entertainment for the kids disney continues to do an excellent job of capitalizing on its popular movies to turn them into enjoyable rides and attractions there is enough to do here to never get bored over three or more days of visits also the food has continually gotten better over the years right now one of my favorites is rancho del zocalo restaurante in frontierland they have a really good roast chicken with mole sauce and of course for fine dining nothing is better than napa rose in the grand californian hotel ,5,2014-09-06
4082,Fastpass system is rubbish,the fastpass system doesn t work you can only book ride every hours and when you get your ticket at each ride you have to come back in an hour to get to the front of the queue ,2,2014-09-05
4083,Get there early,of course disneyland is a great park get there early as the doors were opened before the time listed maybe because of summer i am not sure we got there minutes before time and already opened lines are long in the summer just have patience and fast passes are great some of the time stay in the area of fast passes and do the rides and sights in an orderly manner not hopping from one side to the other save your feet some stresses the disney wait time app is a great app for times in line send one person with all the tickets to get a fast pass while the others either shop or do a ride for the kids while waiting lines are fun if you have bubbles everyone loved the kids bubble machine and kept crying ones happy be sure if in the summer heat to have the water to drink for long lines and snacks also they sell a squirt bottle with a fan the best thing disney has to sell we had fun with two of them squirting each other until wet even if it hit someone in the line they said thank you we don t mind the water a must have for the hot california sun holds a lot of water so can be heavy we just got half a bottle of water each time to fill it up the batteries lasted all days of the trip and we used it a lot food is very expensive but large enough for most of the time eating at california adventure was great at the pier with many places to let each have meals that they like wonderful trip as always ,5,2014-09-03
4084,A MUST FOR FAMILIES,disneyland is amazing i have been here since i was about years old and i ve loved it since i m now with two two kids and a lot has happened since whenever we re in the city we always stop by and spend the day there overall loved everything there the atmosphere rides parades attractions etc we ll come back soon ,5,2014-09-02
4085,I Love Disneyland,i love everything about disneyland the rides parades dining and atmosphere the characters need to be out and about more so there are no long lines to meet them ,5,2014-09-02
4086,3 Glorious Days at Disney and California Theme Parks,my kids are older now so when we went to disneyland this time it was a completely different adventure than when they were small first it was a whole lot of family bonding time and my husband and i went on all the rides yes all of them we chose to go the last week of august because most of the kids in the us are already back to school our planned worked and the line ups were minimal and we were able to get on all of the rides and most of them more than once disney is still a magical place for any age i was surprised by the change in the level of customer service disney is known for their world class service from all members of their teams the entertainers were the same as always effort and friendliness however it was notable that some of the service personnel did not seem as enthusiastic we did not have a bad experience with anyone in particular but having worked in the tourism industry i was disappointed that some of the staff behaved like they were working at eleven rather than the happiest place on earth we had different experiences where an employee was making sarcastic remarks about the quality of the venue to the audience it really took some of the shine off in the long run this could really impact disney s business on the bright side the california soarin cars racers and the water rides really impressed our whole family and were soon our favorites ,4,2014-08-29
4087,Overwhelmed,i remembered bits and pieces of disneyland from when i visited with parents at the age of and now thirty years later all of the great rides were still awesome and the care and creativity taken in putting together the whole park are still amazing ,3,2014-08-27
4088,Still awesome,sixth trip for us first time back in years and dl did not disappoint we expected crowds being summer but it really was not that bad we were there aug we picked up our tickets on the evening of the th so that we would not have to bother lining up the morning of the th it was great to see that some of the rides have been updated including star tours the haunted mansion and big thunder mountain our rule of thumb is not to stand in line more than minutes if the lines are longer than that we come back later or fastpass the only time this did not work was at splash mountain we were in the single rider line which is at the exit of the line and one of the cast members in the loading area of the ride was not using the single rider line properly and it ended up being a minute wait however someone came along and fixed the process and that finally sped things up this was our first time in carsland the first time we went on the radiator springs racers we used the fast pass however we found out about the single rider line if there are only a few in your party and everyone is old enough this is a great option dh and i went single rider twice and both times ended up in the same car one in front the other in back the wait was only about minutes both times actually less than our wait in the fast pass line since we have been here more than once we did not worry if we did not go on every ride however i think we went on every ride that we wanted to at least once so even in the summer i think you should be able to get on every ride if you are there for days we always head out of the park after lunch and then come back after supper when it has cooled down and some of the younger families are leaving the afternoon is also a great time to do souvenir shopping buy what you want and take it back to the hotel room when you go for your break so you don t have to carry shopping bags around with you the one drawback with a summer visit to dl is there does seem to be more breakdowns in the rides especially the rougher bouncier ones likely due to the combo of heat and constant use they were having quite a bit of trouble with indiana jones it was shut down at least twice while we were there and even had a short breakdown when we were next in line to get on the ride the jungle ride and splash mountain were also down on our last day we were hoping for a cooling ride on the grizzly river run but it decided to break down when we went to check it out and there was no guess as to when it would be up and running still lots of other rides never had any problem so there was always somewhere else to go on the hot days check out the theatre shows bugs life muppets etc they are a great way to cool off and there is usually no wait except for the time it takes for the previous show to finish ,5,2014-08-27
4089,Great as Usual,we visited the park on monday th august being first time visitors to disney we were expecting to spend lots of time queueing but we were pleasantly surprised the longest wait we had all day was minutes for space mountain everything else was around minutes wait time we would like to say a massive thank you to lauren in innovations who was so kind and helpful to our family when our son s newly constructed lightsaber from the star tours shop went missing thanks again lauren you re awesome x,5,2014-08-26
4090,Thank you to Lauren in Innoventions,i booked our trip from europe to the us and thought that as we were passing the home of disney it would be silly not to stop and visit it however when the day came i did wonder if we had made the right choice as our daughters are older now and would the magic still be there i need not have worried as soon as we entered the park we did feel that it is the happiest place on earth the experience of the whole day was amazing and we stayed until at night the people were very nice the queues were not too long fast pass is a great system without an extra charge the shows were fantastic and the fireworks were some of the best i have ever seen it was one of the hightlights of our holidays and all the family agreed not to be missed you are never to old ,5,2014-08-26
4091,"Excellent, the magic is still there",just got back from a whirlwind trip to southern california we had a blast we are frequent visitors to disney world but this was our first time to disneyland and we were not disappointed we only had one day for disney and debated whether or not to do both parks or just choose one since my husband and i were traveling with our two older boys and we decided to go for it and do both parks hrs later and we accomplished it and had a great day we pretty much followed the plan in the unofficial guide for disneyland even though it stated over and over not to use the plan on a mm day if you aren t able to use the extra hour while we didn t get to every ride we did get everything in that we really wanted so here we go we were staying in newport so we had a easy minute drive to disneyland we arrived in the woody parking lot at and were at the rope by we had purchased our tickets and parking pass ahead of time there was no line pulling in and w parked in the woody parking lot the shuttle was right there no waiting we waked right into disneyland and up to the rope drop since we were a little early i picked up water and some fruit for a quick breakfast at am sharp the rope dropped and we were off our boys zipped ahead to get the fp for space mountain we rode matterhorn and buzz walked over to peter pan there was a slight wait but not bad about minutes since our fp time had started we went over to btm and fp it by this time it was fp time for space mountain then astro orbitter indiana jones had a minute wait so we decided to fp it after btm it was close to so we decided to have some lunch after lunch and some mickey beignets yummm we rode haunted mansion pirates of the caribbean and then time for btm we then headed to splash mountain and fp d it we rode winnie the pooh and backtracked to small world we then headed to splash mountain we checked on indiana jones but it was closed we decided it was time to head to california adventure saying gooodbye to disneyland we exited and walked the very short distance to ca we first went to radiator springs racers minute wait and no more fp it was around pm at this time we decided to ride everything else and come back to rsr at the end of the day first stop grizzly river run and then off to soaring we did get wet on the river run very wet but it was a hot day and we dried out pretty qucikly toy story midway mania is a family favorite so we headed that way the wait was only minutes love that ride after that my boys had convinced me to ride screamin this was a great roller coaster i am so glad that i rode it pretty much everything in both parks was less than minutes we walked right onto screamin we then headed to the monster s ride this part of the park is pretty cool with all the alice in wonderland stuff after this we were ready for a little break so we grabbed something to drink and sat on the curb just in time for the play parade pretty cute parade after the parade we headed to muppet vision and then little mermaid we walked through bug s land really cute area but we have seen bug s life so we decided to bypass it today radiator springs still had a minute wait so we saw that aladdin was playing so we zipped over there and saw the pm show of aladdin this was really really good we were right by the mad t party so we walked over there they had a band playing we could have easily stayed there for much longer but we still had radiator springs to ride we headed back to cars land i am not a fan of cars but this area is awesome they have done a great job with it we took lots of pictures finally made it to radiator springs whew a minute wait but we knew that would happen so we were in the right mind set from the time we got inline to actually getting on the ride was an hr and minutes the ride shut down twice while we were waiting but it was okay this was the only time in the entire day that we had to wait on a ride the ride was great we loved it thank goodness we were hungry when we got off the ride and were pretty much done with ca we were feeling pretty good and thought let s eat and then try to to get onto indiana jones we ate at bakery in dtd from our seats we were able to watch the fireworks in ca great luck after we ate though we were tired and decided we needed to head back to the hotel so in closing i have two things to add i love disney world and was told over and over that i would be disappointed with disneyland not true we loved dl and will be back and you can do both parks in one day if it was our first time to any disney park then i wouldn t have done it but since we are familiar with disney it worked out really well ,5,2014-08-25
4092,Disneyland and California Adventures in one day!,i was able to celebrate my birthday received lots of well wishes from cast members also got a quick admit to splash mountain sort of like fast pass but better from one cast member ,5,2014-08-24
4093,Magical Family Vacation,cute but so overpriced that it takes away from the enjoyment i felt like i was bending over for mickey and his friends at every turn ,5,2014-08-21
4094,"Too expensive, too crowded.",maybe i am just not a fan of disney parks but i was really disappointed in disneyland at the end of the day i felt that i spent a lot of money to spend hours in line i share a similar opinion of magic kingdom orlando it is just too crowded and there are strollers to dodge at every turn we were only able to get on less than rides and none of those more than once yes we did take advantage of fastpass but it did not really benefit us this day i find the facilities bathrooms food stands etc are not well marked i needed an atm and found one on the map but was unable to locate it despite asking two different cast members who kept directing me to another one farther away food choices were not good i had to consult a separate website for menus and locations of specific foods i saw people with interesting foods but could not find where to purchase them we ended up leaving the park and eating at downtown disney the fact that it is a short walk is a very positive feature we ate and then returned to the park crowds at night were no better we skipped the parades and fireworks hoping the ride lines were shorter but no such luck we were waiting for a late fastpass return but that ride ended up being out of service so we gave up and left glad we went to see the original park but would not return ,3,2014-08-19
4095,"Fun trip, but Disney needs to train employees to be friendlier.",i have never been to disneyland and i spent days of my vacation here i loved the fast passes that you were able to get so the wait wasn t nearly as long and the rides were amazing food prices were expected and wasn t a shock compared to other places the cleanliness of the park was astonishing and the only thing that really bothered me was the rude employees checking you in at the gate and around the park i didn t notice until i went into universal studios and saw a significant difference for disney to prod cast that it is the happiest place on earth then the employees better smack a smile on there face and work on their customer service i couldn t believe how rude some of them were the only nice ones that really stuck in my mind were the employees at the cash register on main street universal studios employees were so friendly and very helpful which in result made me a happier person when i am spending so much money disney has expanded and developed so much over the years if only i could say the same for their employees ,3,2014-08-16
4096,Like a kid in a candy store,awesome rides great light water show and love the downtown disney would have been perfect if they have vip pass with guides like universal studio ,4,2014-08-16
4097,What's not to love,my husband and i went for his th birthday i mean this place is not just for kids in fact i think it s better as an adult it makes you laugh and have fun and forget about being a grown up love it ,5,2014-08-12
4098,It's Disney.,disney does so many things well we went in early may on a thursday and friday the parks were busy both days but disneyland park was packed on friday since we had little kids we never waited too long in line both because the smaller rides are less popular and because we used fast passes wisely the cleanliness of the park is astounding the parades were excellent radiator springs was very cool especially at night head there after world of color for the neon signs and the rides were fun we bought a two day park hopper but there was no reason to do that we did california adventure on day one and disneyland on day two you probably won t hop between parks if you re only there for two days so save some money and do the one day tickets park hopper makes sense if you re there three days or more ,5,2014-08-10
4099,Took me 30yrs to finally get here,i finally came to disneyland after years walking to the turnstiles gave me chills it hit me that i was finally in the place i d heard so many others talk about getting in the park walking down main street with sleeping beauty castle was surreal after a brief wait for rope drop everyone was off to the races for the anna and elsa meet i was second from the people waiting for the opening however there was still a line for the meet an hour and mins later we were meeting the characters of disneys most popular movie right now the lines at disneyland were bearable the food though pricey was delicious the cast members were honestly great they all went out of there way to give us an experience we were just standing around resting and a cast member randomly came up to us to suggest things to do the rides were fun some of the classics are the best the detail that goes into these things is amazing the nighttime fireworks and fantasmic show were the perfect end to our disneyland trip walking down main street one last time staring at sleeping beauty castle i couldn t help but feel emotional this place is promoted as the happiest place on earth and as a magical place well i couldn t agree more maybe it was because it was my first time but i felt sadness to leave but very thankful for the memories disneyland provided me i am thankful for disneyland as it is a place we can all come together age race and color do not matter here just all smiles and laughter walt would be proud the price of admission might deter you from coming for your first time but i assure you it is worth every penny not only for kids but for yourself when your walking down main street that last time with sleeping beauty s castle glowing in the back you ll feel the magic that i did and you ll be glad you experienced the happiest place on earth,5,2014-08-09
4100,i loved it!!!,how can you not love disneyland we went for and a half days and were able to see almost everything we went in october on the first night of mickey s not so scary halloween party the tickets cost extra but we re well worth the money we were able to move around the park without it being too crowded and get on and off the rides with virtually no wait it made the rest of our trip so much easier the longest we waited the first night was about minutes we rode all the major coasters two or three times so that when the park was busier we could spend time walking around and looking at the less popular attractions the fire works that night were great there is nothing like disney where the whole trip is a story i grew up in southern california but going with my husband as an adult was a great one it brought back great childhood memories but also made new ones the park is greatly decorated with tons of different carved pumpkins and all of the disney characters are in halloween costume the drawback is the price i don t know how families with lots of kids can go one suggestion is to buy gift cards when you can or ask fir them as gifts they never expire and you can use them for everything from tickets to food and souviners ,5,2014-08-07
4101,Expensive but worth every penny,if you are debating about whether to choose disneyland or disneyworld consider this summer is the dry season in southern california with warm or hot sunny days and cool nights summer is hurricane season in florida with hot humid days and rain nearly every day in other words the weather in s ca is much better in the summer so in the summer disneyland is better than disneyworld also there is all the history of disney at disneyland now if you are planning to visit at spring break it s probably a toss up as that is the dry season in florida during winter it is no contest florida wins out as it is the cool dry season there and it is the rainy season in california that time of year just some things to keep in mind i took my wife and son there we all had a blast with careful planning we were able to go to all of the rides in the park that we wanted to our favorite rides were star tours my son space mountain mine pirates of the caribbean my wife s and thunder mountain rr all of ours in the summer it s also nice to do splash mountain but it tends to sell out on the fast passes quickly due to the heat my advice is to target a specific area like tomorrowland and get a fast pass for something like space mountain or star tours while you do another ride that has a smaller line like buzz lightyear which is also fun plan to get a fastpass for splash mountain around am and it will probably be for around pm when the heat is greatest you will have a blast my only complaint is that one exhibit wasn t available finding nemo and the matterhorn is clearly showing its age both my wife and i were hurting after that it is so rough on the back they probably need a redesign of that it was one of the funnest days of my son s life you can t put a price on that since burgers are a pop for dinner you might as well eat well at one of the restaurants instead we ate great cajun food at the french market i had red beans and rice with sausage and my wife had cajun meatloaf my son shared our dishes we topped that with cake with drinks and all it was that ain t too bad if we had burgers instead it would have been for the of us so better to just get the more premium food for a few extra bucks this is a trip of a lifetime ,5,2014-08-07
4102,expensive,disneyland is fun to bring the kids were there july to july but my issues with disney land are food and souveniers are way too expensive if you have a family aitd even if you don t the meals are soooo much money also we did manage to find a couple of stands throughout the park that sold fruit yeah also very expensive for the most part the food is fried or very saucy it is very hard to find healthy real food there lowere the prices disney another thing that really really bothered me is that the attendants for the rides and stores etc were not very friendly it s disney we expected them to be happy smiling accomodating but they just looked bored bordering on rude come on disney for the inflated prices you charge you can do better ,4,2014-08-07
4103,Fun For Kids and Kids at Heart,since i know there are about a gajillion reviews for disneyland i m just going to list some tips to make your trip there easier tip while making plans for visiting disneyland i like to check out isitpacked com to see what the crowd prediction is for the day this is by no means completely accurate but it does give you a pretty good idea of how crowded it ll be to keep up to date on the ride times i also use a phone app called mousewait disneyland it lists the ride wait times for both disneyland and california adventure park tip if you have aaa membership check out the aaa website to get a small discount on tickets you can also purchase tickets in the parking toy story parking lot before boarding the bus this saves you a trip of standing in line to buy tickets at the park which can take long depending on how crowded it is tip create a ride strategy for you and your group during the summers especially the wait times for popular rides can stretch to over an hour grab a fast pass for the ride you want to ride most for example indiana jones and space mountain are always popular attractions and thus have lengthier wait times then visit rides with shorter wait times to pass the time haunted mansion big thunder mountain the story book rides in fantasy land minus peter pan which always has a long line tip if you want to see shows and or parades plan accordingly if you are set on snagging a good seat give yourself up to an hour before show time to guarantee a spot my friends and i like to plop down on the sidewalk and enjoy a snack while we wait for the parade so we make the most of our time tip if there s a special event going on expect it to be crowded you name it project grad those hour events holidays etc tip if you bring a backpack bag bring your own bottled water water in the park is expensive tip don t forget to wear sunscreen unless you want to be upset at mickey mouse the next day with your peely looking face if you forget to bring your own i believe they sell sunscreen in the park check out the main street emporium located near the front of the park and then there s another gift shop in fantasy land near the castle that sells sunscreen too tip if you aren t pooped out by then try to stay for the fireworks at the end of the night many stay inside the park but it can get super packed during the summer if you don t mind missing some of the lower shooting aerials i suggest sitting in the area between disneyland and california adventure park many guests end up plopping down and watching the fireworks together ,5,2014-08-06
4104,THE ORIGINAL AND STILL THE BEST,this was smaller and more compact easier to navigate than disneyworld and it s the original both disneyland and california adventure are opposite each other we had the day hopper which meant we could go in and out of each park as many times as we wanted downtown disney is really cool too ,5,2014-08-05
4105,Love Disney / Too Crowded.,my family and i are disney fans and like all things disney we usually visit disney world in orlando so we wanted to visit the original disney in california overall we weren t disappointed but it really was too crowded it was a sea of people everywhere we went i wouldn t recommend visiting it during the summer months if you can avoid it otherwise disney is awesome as usual ,4,2014-08-05
4106,Always a Fun Time,planned ahead and had a great time spent days and rode everything more than once go early you can ride the best rides during the early morning hours,5,2014-07-31
4107,Best. Trip. Ever.,not a day has gone by since we got back that we haven t talked about how much we loved disneyland with my daughter can t wait to go back ,5,2014-07-31
4108,First time visit and some tips for visitors,it was my first time visiting the disneyland park in california i have been to the one in florida a long time ago the first thing i notice is that the california park is much smaller but i would say it s a good size for a full day i went here just with my hubby couple date so it was easier to go around the park we visited on a thursday not a weekend so i would assume it s much busier on the weekend infos and tips the park opens at a m if you have the day pass and closes at midnight fave thrill rides space mountain indiana jones star tours big thunder mountain railroad fave fun rides buzz light year haunted mansion pirates of the caribbean get fast pass tickets for rides such as space mountain big thunder mountain railroad and star tours these get packed really fast like minute wait at around a m there isn t that much crowd so it s best to see the thrill and fun rides don t forget to drink water buy your ticket before going to the park either online or at your hotel i noticed that there s actually long lines for those who buy their tickets at the theme park wear comfy shoes like sneakers not flip flops and have fun it s the happiest place on earth ,4,2014-07-30
4109,They charge way too much money,this park has been around for a long time but they charge you a lot of money to visit it it used to be ok because the prices for souvenirs and food were very reasonable but that is no longer the case expensive to get in and expensive to eat and to buy souvenirs here is something that i found the next day you can bring food and drinks in cooler i highly recommend you do this also get there as soon as they open because by am the park is full ,3,2014-07-28
4110,Best day out!!,had a excellent time at the park excellent staff very friendly and polite all park facilities excellent,5,2014-07-26
4111,holiday from the uk,for kids or the kids at heart this cannot fail to excite the atmosphere is truly magical the rides are great check the time of year you go as some rides are closed in spring and autumn for maintenance kids weren t happy to miss the pirates of caribbean ride plus unless you are there very early the fast passes are a waste of time but we love disney fav rides for family are big thunder mountain railroad indiana jones and buzz lightyear can never get too much of the magic ,5,2014-07-25
4112,Always magical!,we visited the park with both young kids and teenagers and the park was a success for all including we the parents a tip is to go in the weekdays if possible it is a lot more crowded during the weekends some line is to be expected and be sure not to miss the parade evening show and the fireworks ,5,2014-07-25
4113,Great for all ages,we are from florida so we ve been to disney world serveral times but its nice to see the difference enjoyed our visit and seeing the sights really enjoyed california adventure and the cars land ,5,2014-07-22
4114,Great fun,we just spent weeks hitting many of the major theme parks in california with three kids our and year old have celiac disease so we are always looking for kid friendly gluten free options for dining out disneyland and california adventure every restaurant we ve been to at a disney park has gluten free options like buns or pizzas no worries here just ask a server and they can get you set up flo s in radiator springs in california and the pizza place with gf pizza next to space mountain were our kids favorites universal we found the options limited flintstones bbq had some options but we left the park and ate at saddle chop house which is right outside the park s entrance seaworld calypso bay smokehouse was a great option for chicken and pork legoland they had a lot of good options burger stop castle burger and fun town hot dog have gf buns and fries pizza pasta buffet has gf pizza and pasta we ate at pizza mania shorter line and burger stop which were both good grannys apple fries are gf as far as the park goes we liked disneyland much better than legoland we don t have any boys who are who are really into legos and we should have just skipped legoland and done an extra day at disney san diego zoo this was the least gf friendly of all the parks we just packed snacks and ate a late lunch outside the park we are from the east coast so not familiar with a lot of restaurants but here are some of the ones we went to in and out burger has protein burger which is burger wrapped in lettuce plus gf fries our hometown favorites of chick fil a and chipotle had a couple locations sammy s wood fired pizza had decent gf pizza and fries true food kitchen was fantastic with several options ,4,2014-07-21
4115,Gluten free with kids at Southern California theme parks.,we got in right as the park opened and we were able to get on rides with no wait times until around a m then it was madness the crowds were very heavy enjoyed breakfast at carnation cafe lunch at blue bayou and a quick dinner the plaza inn we were very impressed with the service at blue bayou i ordered the flat iron steak but the kitchen sent out the wrong dish the server quickly fixed the issue and even let me keep the wrong dish at no charge so we enjoyed the best of two dishes ,5,2014-07-21
4116,Very busy Saturday,the problem any disney fan may encounter when visiting disneyland is that it s a lot smaller than walt disney world in florida so you really have to approach it knowing that it will be different that being said i found that disneyland was extremely charming and unique from magic kingdom in florida rich in detail and full of the disney magic it will not disappoint ,4,2014-07-21
4117,Just don't compare it to Walt Disney World...,disney doesn t disappoint in spite of the crowds it is everything we imagined it would be pricey but great fun for the whole family,4,2014-07-19
4118,Magic,not that i want to sound like a downer but the first thing which really annoyed me was the ridiculous amounts of babies in prams getting pushed around in a place where it s more suited for children who actually have an understanding of disney characters and can actually ride on the ride attractions for myself i m old enough to appreciate the place itself for the joy it can bring everyone which it did for me but i was expecting some thrill rides which they don t really have in either parks which was a let down for myself but i shouldn t forget that disney is more about the movies and characters for kids this place is great but not for babies if you don t like crowds i wouldn t go during peak season i was lucky to go after spring break in april had finished and didn t have to wait too long for rides i m looking forward to going to the disneyworld in orlando next may ,5,2014-07-19
4119,Don't understand why families think it's a good choice to bring babies in prams to a place like this?!,all the hype is warranted go with good company and you ll have the best time highlights included world of color splash and space mountain tower of terror california screamin soarin indiana jones and taking photos with all the characters tips if you don t want the overpriced park food eat outside or bring food use fast passes for rides i d recommend days for both parks to relax and enjoy ,2,2014-07-17
4120,Must do in California,this was my first visit to disneyland and i absolutely loved it i wish i lived closer i ll be heading back in november for the next rundisney half marathon ,5,2014-07-15
4121,First visit to Disneyland,disney is just a must see i think you need to go with people that like rides like walking and just want to have fun if you take yourself too seriously i wouldn t recommend going expect to spend money to get in as the tickets aren t cheap but its best to go multi day with california adventure you don t need a hopper if you don t want to jump back and forth and can stay within one park make sure you get your fast passes as it helps skip the lines much easier some rides don t really get you too much of a jump in the line with the fast pass where others take you pretty close splash mountain if you want to really get prepared for the park you should watch disney cartoons old classic ones and also the classic movies this park doesn t focus too much on pixar so don t assume this is part of disney it s more on the california adventures for pixar note disneyland didn t have alcohol that i could find this may be a weird comment but i went with a friend who was actually expecting to have something to drink there is alcohol over at california adventure though ,5,2014-07-14
4122,Okay visit except at night,we ve been to disney land many times so it was the same old thing for us however it was fun to watch the experience through the eyes of our grandchildren who had never visited the park overall the day was very nice albeit crowded but we had a good time we returned for the evening at the park and were very disappointed in the crowd control measures used by park employees because of fireworks and the mickey water show certain areas were cordoned off causing bottlenecks to form as crowds were funnelled through narrow spaces all the while park employees are barking orders at the crowd and shouting in people s ears many families were upset because kids were crying as they were being pushed along like cattle off to slaughter with the billions of that disney has you d think they could come up with a better way to present these evening spectacles so that they didn t have to herd their guests in this way ,3,2014-07-13
4123,Too Crowded... Below Par,yes we went at christmas but i ve been to disneyworld at christmas and it was never this crowded the problem is that there are only two parks to which thousands and thousands of people can go the main disneyland park and california adventure their gates are right across from each other disneyworld has the main park epcot center mgm studios two water parks a zoo etc to which thousands and thousands of people can go so there s no comparison to which is less crowded at christmastime so my advice just don t go to disneyland leave it to the people who have annual passes and the people who live in anaheim or if you go don t go for the rides just go to see the first disney park ever opened however don t expect to be able to walk very fast as you literally wade your way through the vast sea of people ,2,2014-07-12
4124,Definitely the happiest place on Earth,what can you fault about disneyland nothing that s what yes the crowds are huge the lines are long and perhaps it is a bit on the expensive side but it s disneyland if you don t go you will regret it there is so much to see i had just as good of a time as my kids maybe even more so we tried everything from space mountain to eating corndogs for dinner we based our trip on what we had seen in the modern family disneyland episode and it did not disappoint we would go back definitely ,5,2014-07-11
4125,Dreams come true :'),disneyland the original never disappoints we recommend spending at least days in the park grab a schedule of events and map at the front gate start early using the fast pass system working your way around the park parades shows and firework shows are a must be patient and enjoy ,5,2014-07-10
4126,Disneyland!!!,we arrived at a after spending the extra magic hour at dca mostly in carsland between a and am we walked onto many disneyland attractions with very little or no wait pirates indiana jones haunted mansion splash mountain big thunder mountain mr toad s wild ride matterhorn we got a fastpass for space mountain at had lunch at blue bayou at p then spent the rest of the afternoon at dca no crowds on the monday after th of july we found out late in the day that season pass holders were blocked from visiting the parks on the monday after the th of july which explained the limited crowding in the afternoon and the absolute empty parks up until lunchtime there is a limited amount of land so attractions are very close to each other for example the exit to the haunted mansion is less than yards from the entrance to splash mountain of course we compared everything to the florida counterpart and had so much fun doing it pirates is far superior at disneyland the ride is longer and has two large downhill rides indiana jones doesn t exist in florida the same platform is used in dinosaur in animal kingdom but indiana jones is a much better attraction space mountain is very different in california the cars are two people wide and there is music pumped into speakers by each guest in florida it is single file the ride in california is much smoother and more enjoyable the florida version is quite rough and completely dark in california you can see a little bit more matterhorn was very rough and i don t think i will go on that one again so many contrasts compared to walt disney world first not very many attractions have fast passes and disneyland is using the paper fast pass system second tickets were not linked to your resort hotel room key even before the magic bands were launched late last year the resort key was also your dining plan key and your park tickets disneyland resort had paper tickets for the theme parks no fingerprint technology just sign the back of your ticket and don t lose it dining reservations are days out not days out and i got the impression that people were getting same day reservations at blue bayou in florida that is impossible the popular dining reservations book up and you can t walk up and expect to get a reservation for later in the same day ,5,2014-07-10
4127,No crowds on the Monday after 4th of July!,we have spent days here so far and love it it s a lot bigger and better than i imagined it is very busy however you never wait for food drinks so many places to eat i love all the different themes that you go through we have a day hopper pass which allows you to go between this park at california adventure next door which is definitely worth it we also have a fast pass which allows you to check in before on certain rides and go back in the times slot and just walk straight through no line up which saves time as some rides have min plus waits ,5,2014-07-10
4128,Expensive but worth it!,been to disneyworld times first and disneyland in general lines are much shorter weather is way way better not scorching hot like florida however unlike disneyworld rides were broken down when we tried to ride add that to those closed and you are looking at over of feature rides closed ,4,2014-07-10
4129,You won't be disappointed,the happiest place on earth hands down bar none have been several times but not for many years here with our six and three year olds five days spent in california adventure the magic kingdom and downtown disney spectacular and as i had remembered it as a child and now even better with the new park and attractions to see the magic light up my boys faces priceless best deal by far is to by park hopper tickets in advance go early for magic hours take a mid day break for naps and pool time then head back for cooler evening hours and fireworks etc california adventure is an absolutely amazing experience particularly cars land and pacific pier this is a must do trip at least once for your children and for you the disney magic is real ,5,2014-07-08
4130,"Boy, does this park need updating!",i have been putting off writing this review because i am a diehard disney fan i admit up front that i am biased to disney world one i worked in the magic kingdom in and before disney added all the other fabulous parks and two we go to disney world annually i have also been to disneyland as a kid and was in love with the place but i have to say it is very much showing its age i was there in june with a grade school friend we had a wonderful time so don t get me wrong tomorrowland is really either yesterdayland or no man s land it is basically closed space mountain was closed people mover is no longer in existence and the carousel of progress is gone it is some home of the future and once you get in god help you if you can find a way out the gas driven cars is still fun a tradition but that is hardly something of the future i don t know if disney actually reads these reviews but it is time to revamp tomorrowland why not do something like you have done with epcot trip to mars is amazing so is the test track there is so many cool things disney could do with tomorrowland mainstreet is still fabulous please please please do not remove mr lincoln it is wonderful yes the intro could be updated but mr lincoln still brings tears to my eyes it is truly a one of a kind it is a shame more people don t see it the train around the park is also wonderful i would have been very very disappointed if the dinosaurs were no longer there i know the history of this attraction along with mr lincoln and it s a small world so i appreciate having there continued presence at disneyland frontierland and new orleans square are still wonderful the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean are absolutely must do s pirates at disneyland is sooooo much better than the one at magic kingdom ever since i was a kid i wanted to eat at the blue bayou restaurant it was worth every penny thunder mountain and splash mountain again are must do s so is the fantasmic light show how those ships make their way around those bends alone is worth the sight there is nothing like adventureland the jungle cruise and the enchanted tiki room are well worth the price of admission omg let s talk matterhorn i remember loving it as a kid as an adult it is one of the worst roller coasters ever it ranks as low in my book as new york new york in vegas disney pay attention here you simply must redo those tracks and update them to the newer smoother ones i felt completely beat up after this attraction it was awful and i love roller coasters unless those tracks are redone i will never be riding that one again sorry for leaving this to the end but you need to know that given the location of disneyland the fireworks are prone to being cancelled they were the night we were there so we took in fantasmic instead which we loved so all in all if you go to disneyland you will have a good time be prepared however for closures not just for repairs and maintenance but because the attractions appear to break down sorry disney for the three stars but you have some work to do ,3,2014-07-05
4131,"Hot, pricey, but hey it's Disneyland!",ok you don t need another review so here s some tips get a chase visa disney credit card get discounts at the park restaurants in the park get a free exclusive x with a character all by yourself no one else around plus earn points to use at disneyland go early in the morning if dca go to cars fast pass first if disneyland go to either jungle cruises or space mountain get all the long lined rides done first and do all the shopping later in the evening when it s cool if you can shop during the fireworks or parade less people socal passes are great get a magic morning at get in an hour early we preferred dca this time over previous trips but the kids are older now radiator springs is cool make sure to be there at dusk when they turn all the lights on just like the movie listen for sh boom and they turn on the lights there s a little spot by sarge s that s nice and cool and a good spot to wait for the lights found an item and waited to get it at another store but can t find it again or the sizes are all gone ask any of the clerks and they will find it for you at any store even the size you are looking for main hall will also help you find specific items and also have a listing on where characters are for the day get to firework and parade spots at least half hour or minutes early if you want a decent spot watch for very rude tourists we had kids stepped on i was pushed out of the way sheesh people are bad ,4,2014-07-05
4132,"Comparable to Disney World, but more downtime on rides",as you already know disney has the best theme parks for young kids the detail in the attractions are top notch the park is kept clean and the shows are spectacular after visiting disney world last year and then coming to disneyland we were surprised by four things the fact that main attractions were down during the summer the fact that the employees had personal conversations going on the number of times that rides broke or stopped running and the poor exit strategy at park closing none of these things really affected our trip but they did make me feel like disneyland isn t managed quiet as well as disney world big pluses for disneyland include the weather the ability to walk from several off site hotels and the fact that every time we stopped to look at the map a maintenance employee asked if they could help us i recommend at least one day at each park disneyland and california adventure you may wish to spend two days in disneyland if you want to do every single ride and show plus hit you favorites a second time ,4,2014-07-03
4133,Worth all of the memories!,i grew up in california and remember going to disneyland as a kid it was the best time and is truly the happiest place on earth so now that i have a family of my own it was very important that my children be able to experience it for themselves yes it is expensive but it is worth ever dollar spent the security is great and eventhough it is crowded everyone just seems so happy to be there that everyone is incredibly polite and nice i love disneyland and if i still lived in california i would definitely purchase an annual pass take your kids and have a wonderful time plan to spend some money but it is so worth it when you see the smile and the awe on your children s faces ,5,2014-07-03
4134,Mechanical breakdowns,indiana jones splash mountain both broke down during visit schedulaed maintenance took out haunted house matterhorn pirates so other rides were under pressure with extra numbers pity ,4,2014-07-01
4135,It's Just the Best,we ve been to disneyland more times than we can count with little children with adult children or by ourselves it is always magical we have been to disney world too and while it s great there is just something more authentic about the original we try to visit in the off season to avoid the crowds while some of the attractions might be closed for refurbishing the trade off of small lines is worth it we fly into orange county airport climb onto a shuttle and are there in less than half an hour there are many many hotels motels to choose from plus having a variety of restaurants at downtown disney helps to cap off a day perfectly we can t wait to go back ,5,2014-07-01
4136,Disney is NOT the happiest place on earth.,park was dirty four of the main rides were either closed down or closed numerous times during the day it s a small world closed ,2,2014-07-01
4137,Disneyland California,this would be my second disneyland visit my first was in but my wife s first definitely a place we were looking forward to in our us trip it was the start of summer when we went there i think it must have been a special break when we were there on the th may yet we had lots of fun despite the crazily huge crowds some of the queues were huge so we missed a couple of the things we had planned to see but we did get to see what was most important for us finding food was a bit tricky because of the huge crowds went to the world of colour show you need to be aware of the viewing location you pay for some are better than others and you can miss some of the view if you are not right at the front or high up but then if you are too close you don t get to see the whole scene properly particularly if you are visiting from overseas and are unlikely to visit again for a while it would pay to purchase a professionally produced dvd from one of the gift shops as it is difficult to do your own and give it full justice ,5,2014-06-30
4138,Extremely Disappointed - Overcrowded and Way Overpriced,i have been to disneyland numerous of times and i am so disappointed as to what has come to the prices are way too expensive fast pass or not you are still waiting in line for at least hour no matter what ride it is it doesn t matter if you have kids or just adults it s not fun for anyone i would save up the money and go to disney world instead ,2,2014-06-30
4139,The original Disney experience,it s the original and it s enchanting went in mid december with a perfect weather the classic disney park is meticulously maintained and while some attractions remain classics others are being updated like a new star wars themed section there was also a small section under renovation but the great majority of the attractions classic and new were working fine visit small world i was a skeptic at first but it s worth the time everyone in the family loved it i wouldn t go during peak season nor in socal s summer still quite busy in mid december and mid week one day is definitely not enough for this park alone it is however quite expensive and there aren t many discounts around disneyland and california adventure have separate adjacent entrances and rates vary for both ,5,2014-06-30
4140,Disneyland,we are passholders and love disneyland we go to times a year but the the crowds seem to get bigger everytime and the staff far less sincere and flat out rude this is the second straight visit cast members have talked about some highly inappropriate things right in front of our kids and tons of other kids while we wait for fireworks the guests making out in line you cannot do much about but the staff working should be a little more aware of the little kids around them i ve also noticed that a lot of the little details that disney has always been so famous for seem to be neglected paint tattered flags dirty tables bathrooms etc we rarely go in the summer so we always expect some sort of work to be done but lately a lot of things seem to be forgotten about we will always love disney and continue to visit but we may let our passes go ,3,2014-06-30
4141,"Truely the ""Happiest Place on Earth""",simply amazing i was expecting it to be a little clich but it was obvious just how much effort the sstaff put in to make it enjoyable for all the fireworks show can be seen easifly from tye surrounding hotels get to thewwonderful world of colour show early to ensure a good spot well worth it make sure you spend some time brushing up on how the fast pass system works i wont repeat it here as its easy to google but this saved us heaps of time in lines ,5,2014-06-26
4142,1 day is not enough,while waiting for my family to come out of the tower of terror the streetcar with the newsie boys and mickey mouse came by shortly thereafter i saw them coming my way i hurriedly tried to get my camera out to take a picture of them but failed then to my surprise mickey walked right up to me and took my hand and kissed it three times it was the highlight of my trip to disneyland in addition the dole pineapple whips are to die for ,5,2014-06-26
4143,Yah Gotta Love It,i m and this was my first visit to a disney park pretty sure i had as much fun as my daughter i was so impressed by the staff always seemed to be smiling always willing to point you in the right direction and the cleanliness amazing we managed to ride most rides all the days we were there and had fun i was surprised by the food costs i can see the merit of going to disney world and getting a meal plan we walked miles every day we were there so be aware of that i was shocked to see that days totaled miles walked we really tried to stick to a plan but it s not so realistic with a year old all in all just an amazing place to get lost and be a kid again,5,2014-06-25
4144,Amazing place,thousands of reviews so i ll keep it short ish we went with our year old who is into disney and pixar but not religiously she was too small for the big rides as that was a blessing as they were the long waits we did one long wait for tinkerbell about mins which in disney terms is not long great selection of rides for younger ones but surprising very little on the merchandise front no frozen stuff to be seen anyhere btw food choices were good and good quality as well much better than legoland seaworld etc and really not that expensive we did one day in the original park and one day in the adventure land with cars both sites were good the end of day parade in adventureland was quieter and full of pixar stuff carsland was aweswome only negatives the line up for frozen was hrs on a tuesday i have no idea who would do that to their child luckily despite being a big fan we had primed our daughter with the potental by pass we had lunch with ariel which as a bit disappointing had to queue to see her she the only one didn t look like the character and then we sat down for our meal which took ages to arrive very expensive for what it was but it was good to sit down for an hour within the madness and relax i didn t think i d be that bothered about most of disneyland i loved it it was awesome and the fact my daughter beamed from ear to ear for two days made it even better yes its expensive yes its busy we went on a tues and a thurs adventureland is quieter but it was fantastic us adults are thinking of going back for a few days on our own much better than legoland which doesnt allow you to bring in your own food btw one last tip bring a stroller i was against the idea as my daughter is but you really need it and everyone has them worth its wait in gold and on most airlines free anyway ,5,2014-06-25
4145,Great place; poor service,we spent days in disneyland anaheim days in disneyland and days in california adventure we brought our and y o kids and they had a blast we could have stayed even longer and they would have not been bored at all we went on may to and the waiting time for the rides range from minutes to hours we enjoyed the park so much and it was just dream like we are already arranging our next trip to tokyo disneyland next year due to the amazing experience we had in this park our favorite rides the cars ride in california adventure ranks the best in our book indiana jones for disneyland fantasmic vs world of colors we choose world of colors as the better show frozen attraction was just introduced when we visited and since we had one magic morning available we used it to line up for the frozen pictorial session the waiting time was hours i understand that this is a new attraction and the frozen movie earned superstar rankings and i can keep up with the wait my biggest complain is the attitude of anna she was all cranky and unfriendly and she was in such a rush to ask her guests to leave i had to tell her that we waited for hrs and i am not going to just leave without having everyone in our party get their shot reminder the reason people line up for these attraction is not because of you but because of the characters note to disney pls screen your crew members as they might assume that they are the superstar when they are not they are replaceable,3,2014-06-24
4146,Impressed despite cost. Can't complain,it is the most amazing place on earth we travelled from aus with out kids aged and it was our rd time to visit the park first time for our kids yes i cried when i took the kids through the gate for the first time a dream come true to take my babies here the boys had a ball and loved it even my near year old enjoyed all the rides including the babish sort of rides they were in awe of what they saw but we went in jan th th boy oh boy our first day there we arrived so early and there were hoards upon hoards of people there we thought we were being smart and timed it to be there after the us holiday season boy were we wrong we found it was the last day for season ticket holders to use their passes last day of the parade and last day for fireworks and many school had the day off in the morning it was good but by am forget it by pm we could not move it was very dangerous and scary for our kids people use their prams like weapons to ram you it was just a free for all really it completely ruined our experience for the day the good thing was we had a system for fastpassing and this is the key to enjoying your day our advise fastpass say indiana jones and then go straight to the matterhorn it has long waits all day long so make the most of it and go there first it also broke down at least once over the days we were there then go straight to peter pan as you cant fastpass that and its always so busy all day and night tip is all family members queue for one ride and another member goes and fastpasses and then joins the rest of the family we actually managed to get on everything on this crazy busy day because we had a system that just worked the next day was a little less hectic so we could really enjoy the day there the mornings are definitely the best time to go there get there as the gates open as we did and you can get on a few rides very quickly overall we love this place but really on busy days you need better crowd control or shut the gates once a certain amount of people enter it people were not happy everywhere and it really spoilt the day at one point we were all but trapped in new orleans area so we sat on a wall and chatted to a lovely security guard watching the hoardes of people it was at the point of being dangerous we still love this place and over the next couple of day we really had a great time you just have to be careful when you visit big round of applause to the cleaners those toilets are pristine all day long and they are meticulous in the upkeeping of them well done cleaners have lots of patience wear comfy shoes and enjoy the day its fantastic overall,4,2014-06-23
4147,Disneyland is the King of them all,my children and i have spent a few times enjoying disneyland and now i am taking my granddaughters once again they love everything the disney characters the ice cream the princess costumes and fantasyland it s the only time they really look forward to getting up early it s truly one of the happiest places on earth ,5,2014-06-23
4148,Amazing Time,our family tries to make it down to disneyland at least once a year it is always an amazing time due to the reactions of my children i have a year old some and when we are in the part i see him as a year old as children get older the things that they love about the park change but they still enjoy every minute inside the park there were times in the park during our visit that people stopped to watch my youngest due to her excitement about everything i cherish every minute in the park every memory that we make and every smile i get from my children i have been going to disneyland for a very long time so the lines and people don t bother me if you are going to the park for the first time talk to someone that goes often so you can get some pointers tips water is free if you ask any of the dinning locations the fix it felix arcade game is free over in tomorrow land fast pass is a must if you have smaller kids make sure you do rider swaps pins are a great way to have a little fun in the park christmas is an amazing time to go bring ziploc bags to put items in when going on splash mountain and the river run watch a show they are always good look at the windows on mainstreet it is the disneyland hall of fame then learn about the people that are on them ,5,2014-06-18
4149,Always a great time at a price,we always have a really good time hear hard not to in the happiest place on earth right it was however very crowded and always feels overpriced after saying that what a superbly kept resort and they dont go small we really enjoyed the california adventure park though have not been there before and highly recommend a day there ,4,2014-06-18
4150,John in Albuquerque,it was great as usual food was good but don t order the monte cristo sandwich at the cafe orleans ralph brennen s jazz kitchen is great ,5,2014-06-17
4151,A great place for a great outing,everybody knows about disneyland and california adventure the two great disney theme parks in anaheim california it serves no purpose to continue to repeat what everyone knows about these great places but i will give you a few tips the popular rides fill up early so the best strategy is to arrive when the park opens in the morning and immediately go to the fast pass locations for the rides the you want to get on once you obtain your fast pass tickets you can then a leisurely begin going on the other rides if the ride is crowded and you had the choice of going in a line marked single riders only go ahead and use it this line moves much faster than the family crowded line and you can get on the ride in half of the time and many times you happen to be with your family anyway the food prices in the park are pretty uniform and the food is not all that bad for amusement parks however if you want alcoholic beverages you can get the best prices on beer over near the paradise pier area of california adventure the sourdough bread at boudains in california adventure is literally fresh out of the oven and you can t beat the taste get some while you re there if you re done doing the amusement park experience and you re still hungry for some reason walk a few feet to downtown disney with a huge number of restaurants all of which serve really good food both disneyland and california adventure offer an entire day s activities take plenty of water with you and have a great time ,5,2014-06-16
4152,Timing is everything,we drove here from seattle and hoped to spend at least one day at disneyland we purchased day park hopper tickets from the disneyland ticket booth right outside the gates considering we were dropping the cast member was really gloomy and unhelpful at the end of the transaction she said unconvincingly have a magical day it was really frustrating to visit on june th it was the last day of school for the local kids so we thought we d timed it just right we were wrong the place was so busy we had trouble getting on any of the rides without a long wait and several attractions were closed grizzly river run was completely dried out and we saw the rafts sitting behind the fence near the entrance by the grand californian hotel we ended up sitting around people watching for much of the morning as we got tired of fighting crowds to walk around in circles without being able to ride anything we came back that night and found that it was full of local high school students which would have been okay if they weren t hyped up from their last day of school one group of boys came running up behind my husband and stomped their feet scaring him we later saw them bothering a security guard and talking a selfie with him anyway it was even more difficult getting on rides from pm on because several were closed for parades and other events which used to be perfect for drawing crowds away from the rides it s frustrating that they close off so many of the walkways during the evening events although the park may be open until pm or am it s really closed early if you consider that many of the rides and areas are off limits it would be nice if there was a way to get a certain of hours per tickets so that if you didn t want to come back on the same hectic day you could try another one with the same tickets we feel irritated that we spent so much money and couldn t enjoy the parks next time we ll try to be more strategic about coming when kids are in school and maybe during a blackout date for the local annual pass holders ,3,2014-06-15
4153,Disneyland you have changed,i have been fortunate to visit disneyland several times in my lifetime it doesn t seem to have that happiness quality as it once had i was very excited to spend two whole days there with my and year olds our first day was a wednesday which i did my research was supposed to be a less populated day boy was that wrong it was jam packed i believe it was full that day it was horrible people everywhere fighting people to walk go to the bathroom and of course spend hours in line for rides it makes for an unpleasant day i wish disneyland had a quota can only sell so many tickets in one day the rides were still fun our favorites pirates splash mountain indiana jones and peter pan our nd day wasn t as packed but still a lot of people we enjoyed the parade but it was windy so they didn t have the fireworks which was a bummer bring a ton a money with if you are planning on eating in the park every place is so expensive and a rip off for a bottle of water yes you can ask for free water but it tastes horrible rent a stroller for any child that can fit in one i have a year old and was so glad i did there is no way he could have done all the walking we did i rented it for two days the one thing to know is you have to buy on the outside of the park and you can not take into downtown disney which was also a bummer since it is a mile or more from the park to disneyland hotel were we stayed too long of a walk for a little guy at night we did take monorail from park to downtown disney several times but that is a lot of extra waiting but had no choice since we had to leave our stroller at disneyland also wasn t happy that they close alot of fantasyland and the castle when they are going to shoot off fireworks which was a real bummer to us if we ever get to go back again i am going to have to plan a trip in february so we can actually ride the rides without the long lines ,4,2014-06-14
4154,More magic please.,we stayed for days at disney ca adventure and had some wonderful experiences this was our first time at california adventure and we enjoyed it tremendously utilize the fastpass system to plan the highlights of your day and you will avoid the ridiculous waits at many of the more popular rides also get your fastpasses early as they will sell out later in the day stay at least once for the world of color water and lights show at ca adventure i didn t think i could be impressed any more but then a couple of negatives we tried to ride the trolley in california adventure and got kicked off there were some families and lots of strollers but we grabbed empty seats only to have the driver tell us to get off because they were full i m sorry but how are you full with empty seats in disneyland we waited over an hour to ride the roger rabbit ride we were a party of five and we tried to squeeze three in one car two in another didn t work the ride operator told us to split so i agreed to ride alone as one of my kiddos was moving cars he red headed cast member barked at her to hurry up and make a decision no joke she was already moving and i was already back in line with the other patrons waiting not quite the service you expect from disney ,4,2014-06-14
4155,What A Fun Time!,we have always loved disney and have been to disney world in orlando many times disneyland was everything we expected it to be and more since smaller than disney world it is much more intimate and easier to take it all in over less time in two days we were able to see and do almost everything we wanted to we will for sure be back for more fun while we are living in california if near the anaheim area a disneyland visit is a must ,5,2014-06-14
4156,If I had never been to Disney World it would have been an average rating,i was so excited to go to the happiest place on earth with my four kids just a week ago we did prepare for our trip by using ridemax which helped a lot we were able to ride almost everything i would never ever recommend someone go to disneyland without a plan set out we saw only characters during our hour visit they clearly do not have any kind of crowd control going on because it was busier there than disney world at christmas the employees are not as friendly as the cast members at disney world in fact a few times they were just downright rude as we got our hands stamped to leave an employees said to my son hey kid its this way and thats just not what you get at disney world the cast members there disney world are taught to treat customers with respect even if they are small it was not magical and it was way over crowded you d think that for as much as they charge to get in they could manage the crowds a little better if you hate crowds you will definitely want to skip disneyland we were at the front of the line at rope drop and we went straight to peter pan s flight and the line was already wrapped around the building it was total chaos there during the parades you are shoulder to shoulder once you ve been to disney world disneyland is just one big let down we got to the fireworks an hour early and had to sit almost all the way to the buildings on main street and then we walked straight to fantasmic and there was no seating left the employee we encountered there was also rude if you want the experience of disney but can t make it to disney world then by all means go just make sure you go early and have a plan i suggest ridemax if you want a truly magical experience skip it and fly to orlando instead i am glad we got to mark it off our bucket list but we will not go back ,2,2014-06-11
4157,Magical,i ve been a few times to disney parks and i never planned to originally go went i decided to visit la but i just had too and i am so glad i did i booked through my virgin rep and it was really good value for money with the travel and entrance to the park although its not a big as florida i was so excited and they had plenty of rides for young and old there was a vast selection of eateries within the park and gift shops and lots of disney characters around all day so you could have your photos taken access around the park was good too with a train which takes you to each section of the park i had so much fun and if i ever visit la again i will certainly being going back ,5,2014-06-08
4158,Not enjoyable at all. Doesn't compare to Disneyworld,i am a dvc member and visit disneyworld at least once every year or two i have always found it impeccable i assumed that would have been the same for disneyland oh so not true i recently visited for days the first day i went at night around since the park didn t close until or i thought it was open but of the rides were not running many of the restaurants were closed we went to pizza plaza and they were closing at i entered at and you could visibly see the staff was not happy about that the pizza was cold most of the other counter entrees were closed most disturbing was the attitudes of the staff the floor looked like it hadn t been swept all day i couldn t wait to get out of there unfortunately the staff attitudes are the same among the employees throughout the park i felt like i was at islands of adventure when schools were taking their trips although there were many families there mit was overrun with obnocious teenagers and everything was out of control the cast could care less on the rides while they are part of the experience in florida who was yawning and who was yelling at kids not to do certain things seemed to be the run of of the day we went to california adventure the following day and found it to be cleaner but that was in the morning but there was no difference in the cast demeanor it just felt like they didn t want to be there it s hard to imagine how different the two resorts are save your money and go to florida ,2,2014-06-06
4159,Happiest place on Earth...,everything was wonderful about our visit but some notes for next time bring battery back up for my phone disneyland needs a day pass california is good for a day pass avoid gift shops get celebration button at gift shop map out what shows to see use only photo pass per family,5,2014-06-04
4160,Happiest place on earth but could be happier if food was better bargain.,pros disneyland is an entertainment experience not just a theme park they have something fun for all ages you turn the corner and there is a parade or some other kind of singing and dancing going on in the middle of the street we enjoyed the parades at both disneyland and california adventures the fireworks display at night at disneyland was great the world of color performance at california adventures was better the fantasmic show at disneyland was incredible the indoor play of aladdin at california adventures was up to broadway standards with talented actors and props and punchy lines that kept you entertained the rides as usual at both parks were awesome we particularly enjoyed soarin over california we took of our kids ages with us and our year old granddaughter and i was amazed at the activities for our year old she loved meeting the disney characters especially the princesses and mickey and minney we were sure to get fast passes early for the rides with longer lines and this made the experience even more enjoyable the cons the food was not a good value for the price although there were some venders who would give you cups of ice water for free most would not we spent a lot of money just purchasing water to give you an example of the food costs i spent getting a small plain hotdog that had some apple slices with it the apple slices were bitter not sure why this was one of the lower priced meals usually we spent at least and were disappointed with the food quality and portions one park attendant told us that the best value for food in the park was some kind of all you can eat barbecue that was close to per person parking at the park was a whopping per day per car lastly the restrooms at disneyland were not clearly marked we spent a lot of our time asking attendants where the bathrooms were california adventures had restrooms marked clearly ,4,2014-06-04
4161,Somewhat disappointing,the park itself is lovely and very detailed but it seems like it is run down by the management a lot of the main attractions were closed for refurbishment or other reasons when we were there among others finding nemo it s a small world indiana jone s adventure and pirates of the caribbean while we tried to enter innovations the fire alarm went off and the building had to be evacuated after that we were waiting in the sun for an hour to go for a ride in the matterhorn bobsleds only to be told that there was a technical failure and it wouldn t continue for at least another half hour by noon it got very crowded in the park and it was almost impossible to enter any of the remaining major attractions without disney s fastpass or standing in line for hours no fun at all ,2,2014-06-04
4162,Magical for all ages,we went in may weather was hot but we loved that the fireworks at night are a must see so magical we ours cased tickets before we left and suggest using fast passes inside the park we didn t find the wait times an issue arrived at the park about am and left midnight both nights the park is very clean staff friendly and helpful food is good and about what you would expect to pay at theme parks shopping good and had different themes for each shop fantasyland has the best rides for all ages if you never go any where visit disneyland ,5,2014-05-31
4163,Great!,great experience for young and the old the main issue would be the scary crowds and the queues to the rides ,5,2014-05-31
4164,As magical as any place can be,my wife and i just took our month old daughter to disneyland for the first time a few weeks ago we went on a weekend that was considered a slow weekend but it was still packed which is to be expected at one of the mod popular travel destinations on the planet we weren t in a rush to get on rides so we took our time walking around the park i looked online ahead of time to see what rides would be closed something previous reviewers didn t seem to bother with it seems and noticed small world pirates of the caribean and a few other popular rides would be closed for maintenance no biggie there s enough to do there and we plan on going back often we got to ride the dumbo ride winnie the pooh ride jungle cruise my daughter loved this ride toon town and a few others we also met mickey goofy winnie tigger and eyore all the lines moved quick as the cast members are experts at taking your pic and shuffling you forward we ate at the pirates of the caribean restaurant for dinner which was quite expensive but the food was better then hotdogs and other junk food around the park got a filet for but it was decent truth is you need to know you are going to spend money here a lot of it it s not a bargain but the price is worth it in fact we stayed late so we could see the fantasmic show in new orleans and that show alone was worth the price of admission blew my mind so fun my daughter was captivated for the entire minutes here s a hint if you want a good spot but don t want to camp out for hours stand behind the large black lighting podium it looks like a horrible spot but minutes before the show starts it s lifted straight up into the air and completely out of the way we had a perfect spot while hundreds of others squeezed into odd spaces to see the show plus that spot is directly where you want to be since the whole show is played towards that direction overall it was an amazing day night we ate got balloons rode rides laughed and had the experience you see in commercials if someone gives this place below stars don t trust them they probably are either grumpy people naturally who can never be satisfied or they had an isolated incident that is atypical for this kind of establishment if you have a baby bring a stroller or rent one of theirs if you bring your own bring a carriage lock so no one walks away with it doubt there s much theft like that but people are naturally morons and do crappy things when you least expect it don t leave your valuables out while you ride something take it with you or have someone watch the stuff if you have a kid you can get a stroller pass when you leave the ride so your spouse can go on the ride next with out waiting i will say this i grew up on east coast so disney world is where my family would often go overall disney world is better and bigger but disneyland in the original and just a s much fun living in la will allow us to casually return throughout the year whenever we get the urge it s only minutes from our home ,5,2014-05-30
4165,Family Fun,we loved the rides the range of food the friendly atmosphere the fireworks world of colour visiting on weekdays for shorter waits we didn t like saturday wait times we had a wonderful disneyland experience and we hope to visit again ,5,2014-05-30
4166,Love Disneyland,we did a two day two park ticket and the highlight is disneyland ca adv is good getting better but disneyland is still the place to go ,5,2014-05-29
4167,Way to Crowded,we have been to both parks in orlando and anaheim and disney world is far superior disneyland is small and we experienced very long lines for everything and some of the rides were closed we left disappointed ,3,2014-05-24
4168,Huge Crowds and Closed Attractions,our first trip to disneyland was ruined by the massive crowds and number of closed attractions while the california adventure park was not nearly as crowded as disneyland there were still one to two hour waits for most rides and attractions and the fastpass availability was either for very late in the day or nonexistent disneyland was so crowded it was impossible to walk in the park and waits for rides and attractions were two to three hours so many rides and attractions were closed as well including many of the most popular ones food prices were actually not too terrible and the food itself was good to very good in particular we enjoyed the sonoma terrace which had some good wines and a wonderful terrace on which to enjoy them however we will never return as the price of admission was a poor value for what we were able to do ,2,2014-05-23
4169,Too many closed rides,we went in early may with a large group this is the big trip they take every year usually they go in june but to beat the out of school crowds we went in may there were rides closed most of them were the ones our group loves pirates nemo jungle cruise small world was closed and looked like it had been for quite some time leaves in the canal no water when we came last year it was also closed the new system they have in place to serve the disabled is pretty good but maybe letting people have more than one ride on reserve would be better we spent more time trying to find the accessible kiosks than we did on rides kudos to the cast members though when one of our group got misplaced they flew into action and had eyes on him within minutes ,3,2014-05-22
4170,definitely go,although this place wasnt big it was still fun my favorite was the attraction that resembled bumper cars i recommend taking the train ride to the other side of the park and then walking back the fireworks were okay although you don t really have to see them save the gift shops on the main street for last theres also a buffet restaurant across from the entrance and its crowded at night too because of the many hotels ,5,2014-05-18
4171,Still the one!,i know a lot of folks have been complaining about how so many attractions are down right now but i knew that well in advance by checking the disney website so no disappointment for me the main reason for this trip was to get an annual pass before prices increased and i made in just in time i have never had an ap before but seeing as i am planning on going several times this year it only made sense while visiting the park i finally got to ride the classic haunted mansion and have to say it is again a favorite i have only been to disneyland in october for the last or so years and have been stuck with that nightmare before christmas version disney really should just do it every other year anyways it was fun and still magical ,5,2014-05-18
4172,Not the Happiest Place on Earth,well we ended up going to disneyland on the hottest day of the year and maybe ever at disneyland that being said we thought water rides were in order but the river rapid raft ride at california adventure was closed as was pirates just as we were about to get onto the matterhorn they closed it down my daughter and husband got stuck on the indiana jones ride for quite awhile the waits were long and very hot alice in wonderland finding nemo and it s a small world all closed little mermaid in calif adventure was closed and finally reopened people were hot and cranky including the disney cast members at for a two day park hopper we don t think it was worth it my husband does not want to return to disneyland for a very long time ,4,2014-05-18
4173,Visit Disneyland and Let the Magic Begin,want to visit one of the world s most popular theme parks it happens to be in california and it s none other than disneyland a magical place for kids and adults disneyland personifies the all american family vacation the beloved disney characters the rides the merchandise and everything else at the park are highly recognizable and almost certain to put a smile on the face of even the most finicky guest disneyland means different things to different people to me and to my kids disney is all about the characters and not just the ones from the cartoons and animated movies but also the ones from the disney channel my girls loved walking through the park and discovering some of their personal character favorites depicted on rides shops restaurants memorabilia and more everyone loves at least some of the disney characters movies and television programs and each and every one of them can be found somewhere in the park disneyland features rides parades live shows etc and the best way to visit the park is to set aside some time to experience as many different forms of entertainment as possible the park is divided into sections such as tomorrowland fantasyland mickeys toontown and more each has its own personality rides and features kids will often migrate toward a specific favorite and each is justified as they all have something to offer disneyland is expensive and the wait for rides is often quite long one thing i learned is that the fastpass which helps you bypass the long waits isn t valid on all rides your best bet is to not purchase the fastpass save money and try to go during the slower days of the week like monday and tuesday the crowds are thinner on these off days and it will save you and your family much stress disneyland truly is a magical place and the park has something to offer every member of the family my kids loved it more than me but i still find many things to like about this popular tourist destination the best part of all was the utter joy that it brought my kids that alone makes a visit to disneyland worth the price ,4,2014-05-15
4174,LOVE disneyland but not on Spring Break,this is our th year in a row going to disneyland we have gone from march to the end of april we have gone during our spring break in the past but it must have been later than other schools this time it was the most popular time which meant no deals on the hotel or the tickets there were also a huge amount of people we did the early morning days in a row which was great and worked well except that the park opens early when its really busy so the early morning was the crack of dawn ok it was but trying to get my kids up and going and breakfast was a stretch we did manage to ride the cars ride x tho and hit all the great rides without too much waiting we worked the fast pass as the books tell you to and kids and parents were happy not to wait hit the pool during the mid afternoon when it was hot and the most crowded we even managed to get on the matterhorn x forgot to get the awesome cast members name who took a liking to my youngest daughter who has special needs and was hugging the cast member and asking her to come on the ride with us i was a bit worried about the ride because of the yeti s flashing but my daughter did great and loved it immediately signing more when we were done the cast member reached over and took my daughters hand and said to me follow me walked us over to the other side and put us on the other track then later when my daughter walked over to thank her she handed her a pass to come back on it completely made our day we ve never needed to obtain one of the disability passes for my daughter because she has surprised us in how well she has handled the lines but this was sure a special treat ,5,2014-05-13
4175,Disneyland,third visit to disneyland had a great time on each stay much smaller than disneyworld with only parks as opposed to parks and water parks in florida however love the quaintness of disneyland compared to disneyworld everything is within an easy walking distance at disneyland with both park entrances located within a yards of each other as well as the convenience of downtown disney no need to wait in line to board buses or the monorail though they both share a lot of the same rides there are some suttle differences cars land is neat as is california screaming disneyland is awesome ,5,2014-05-13
4176,Poor procedures,i have not been to disneyland resort for about years it was awful several of the adult rides were not open during the early morning hour they closed rides regularly and they did not have them staffed to run both sides only half the ride would be open so the crowds were as bad as the summer months i am a die hard disney fan and was so disappointed i will not return to disneyland resort ,1,2014-05-13
4177,Fun even for diehard cynics!,we really enjoyed this disneyland it s very similar to the one in paris but with better weather we managed to do all we wanted in this park in one day but then we didn t have any kids with us and we didn t do the big rides where queues can be over an hour easily i recommend pacing yourself because it s a tiring day ideally try and stay within walking distance so that you can get in early when there aren t many queues go home for a power nap and then come back for the parade not much shade so wear a hat fantasmic is great the kids plays are sweet too like pantomime without any of the good bits the parades are great fun get a timetable of shows and parades when you arrive so that you can plan what you want to see you will have to be ready for shows and parades a good mins early to get a good spot all the staff are super friendly and helpful even when gently corralling thousands of people they have a great gift for crowd control the downside is the food it is horrendous try and bring something healthy with you because it is just cheap fatty sugary nonsense when you get inside ,5,2014-05-11
4178,Truly the best theme park out there,my days at disneyland are always so magical one good tip is to try and visit during the off season if you want shortened wait times the compromise is shorter days but with less people in the park it s worth it ,5,2014-05-09
4179,fun family place but tiring at times,we spent days at disneyland with a park hopper pass with fast passes and it was a fun exciting trip we loved all the rides and things to see it did get a little tiring at times and the walking was exhausting too many strollers running people over lines were very long at times fast passes were not being utilized our being allowed for some rides we went to the cars ride at california adventures and both days you were not allowed to use your fast pass and we waited in line for hour and minutes the one day which is very hard on a person s back and for people with children staff was very friendly at restaurants and stores at times it was hard to get a picture with a character they would allow a few people and then cut it off saying come back well its hard to come back you can t really sit around and wait when there is so much to do and see we barely got to see everything with days especially when you wait an hour for a minute ride i would definitely not take a child under the age of to disneyland my kids loved the world of colour show and the parades we loved the cars ride ferris wheel for the view splash mountain space mountain blue thunder star wars show was fun also enjoyed the boat rides the pirates of the caribbean was also fun and entertaining ,4,2014-05-09
4180,Absolutely fantastic time!,it was the highlight of our trip to the california we all had a great time we took a day park hopper pass but it was still not enough to see and ride everything next trip we plan to take a one park a day pass so that we do more in one day in one park especially with young kids its easier to not have to be hopping around despite that we all had a memorable visit and we all including our year old boy and girl had an enjoyable time ,5,2014-05-09
4181,Too many double wide baby buggies,i love disneyland park usually i have a great time however they need to stop allowing double wide baby buggies in the park parents ram into people racing to get where ever they are going they roll them into bathrooms and bring it kids into the handicapped bathrooms ignoring the handicapped person me who is asking them for first use of the bathroom we were also disappointed to find so many major rides down for repair and then having only lands open for magic morning it crowed thousands of people into tomorrowland fantasyland making lines a minute wait immediately after opening ,4,2014-05-09
4182,Not the same Disneyland that it used to be.,disneyland is still a fun place but for starters the cost to get in the gate detracts from being the happiest place on earth i was last at disneyland in today they have added parking used to be free and entry each if you are a kid you get a cut to if you are a senior veteran handicapped they don t seem to care walt disney would not have been so inconsiderate of seniors vets and handicapped after having visited disneyland four times in the s i am now so disappointed that i will never encourage anybody to visit them ,3,2014-05-08
4183,"Oh, how we love thee, Mickey!",i am a disney convert i didn t grow up loving this place i never even wanted to go to california but i loved our family vacation to disneyland i took my yr old son and yr old daughter and we had a blast i highly recommend renting from city strollers if you don t want to lug a stroller or two along with you on the plane ,5,2014-05-08
4184,Most Rides Closed or Broke Down,lots of rides were shut down due to renovations and the rides that were open kept closing due to technical problems for example i went to ride splash mountain and was in line times before it was working long enough to get on finally way to many people for so many things to be going wrong ,1,2014-05-08
4185,Disappointing,we went with the kids if you are around i guess you have to go to disneyland it is clearly not worth the money in a private conversation i would use other words but not in a public forum far too little rides even if all of them worked which they didn t substantial parts of the park closed for renovation the rides as such are not exciting the waiting times horrible i guess you could try to change something but it would not suffice anyway we waited minutes for each ride and that was on a monday working day and you know what we were there for hours and did not see one single character that is what is in all the advertising and what the kids would have enjoyed a lot but we met not a single one and that was the hugest disappointment ,2,2014-05-06
4186,Too many people & Rides Down!,there were too many people strollers and kids everything is so expensive they should discount your tickets when major attractions are closed we went and pirates of the carribian thundermountain submarines its a small world alice in wonderland gadget coaster in toon town indiana jones adventure the little mermaid and white water rafters or whatever its called at cali adventure were all closed thats highway robbery since so many rides were closed it made all the other rides stupid packed i wish we had a better experience ,3,2014-05-02
4187,It's a sad sad sad world after all,my husband has never experienced any disney theme park in his life so on a week long visit to so cal our friends said that we must take him i wanted to go to catalina island alas we went on a wednesday first of all there is no benefit to visiting the website as no deals are to be found and updates on park rides are not present after paying our huge daily fee we spent the next hours walking huge distances to discover of their major rides out for service and stopped for the day to be fixed no where on their site did it mention this therefore leaving us huge lines for the rest i was also shocked to discover the age of the attractions everything seemed so tired the worst part was our experience to get a photo with minnie mouse on separate occasions within hours we approached to get in line and were told she would be leaving for her break did she ever get one how many do they get are there not more people playing the roles yes it looked like kids were enjoying seeing the characters eating yummy stuff and spending the day in the park but as an adult trip it was not enjoyable to walk so far to see an attraction i was expecting so many more rides closer together the parade was well done fireworks a big hit and having a locker helped but our family will never return for an adventure ,2,2014-05-02
4188,Save Your Money And Go To Universal Studios!!!!!,magic mornings don t mean anything anymore you get in a hour early to find out that you only get half the park and out of those rides they didnt have the big rides open like space mountain most of the rides are out dated unlike universal i brought kids ages from to that all liked universal studios better than disneyland will never come here again ,1,2014-05-02
4189,Awesome As Always,love disneyland it really is the happiest place on earth staff all happy and nice no problems with broken or not working rides super magic day stay for the fireworks its worth it ,5,2014-04-30
4190,Left me underwhelmed,we were anticipating a great day but the queues were huge although this was expected we didn t take the express passes but we managed to skip the lines on a few attractions as single riders compared to the florida parks that we have visited on this holiday disney universal and aquatica the park looks very dated to the florida parks what really ticked us off was that no less that six attractions were closed yes six we felt ripped off that we have paid full price for what is substantially less than a fully operational park it s obvious that they need to update but six attractions at the same time please beware if you are visiting soon in comparison to other parks that we have visited the food and drinks are expensive overall as much as we did enjoy what we did the fact that so many attractions were closed left us more than a little underwhelmed and disappointed ,3,2014-04-29
4191,We call it home,got our fourth visit in three years coming up we just love it not quite disney world in florida of course but being the original park does have it s charm ,5,2014-04-29
4192,Awesome,what a great place to visit simply magical we liked the shows including the street parades all really well done disliked the boredom while waiting fora ride or show surely there can be some entertainment while people wait which is what sea world did when we were there,5,2014-04-29
4193,"It is Disneyland.....but service, crowd movement slipping",how do you not enjoy disneyland well we of course enjoyed it rides entertainement fireworks all outstanding however the new photo id constant checking changed minute lines to get in the park to minute lines really what s the issue we had purchased on line tickets which you need to get turned into park tickets so started with the outside booth short line people booths open figured minutes we were there over an hour this is not disney like once in the park each day great it is after all disneyland but whew terrible way to start each day ,4,2014-04-28
4194,Cozy!,my kids enjoyed this park more than the one in florida because it seems smaller and not as crowded there s a lot to do but not so much that you get overwhelmed or feel that you won t get a chance to see everything looking forward to go back next year ,4,2014-04-24
4195,Happiest place on earth!,the atmosphere even across the road is amazing there s nothing quite like being at disneyland it s the stuff dreams are made of pricey sure the best rides around not necessarily with that said though their theming is second to none and everything they do is done to the highest of standards definitely consider staying across the road and getting the flexible passes that way you can head back to your accommodation in the middle of the day when it s busiest and have the flexibility to switch between the parks to avoid the crowds when possible be sure to wear your comfy shoes ,5,2014-04-23
4196,How the mighty have fallen,i have been to disneyland and disneyworld several times it used to be that disneylands charm and simplicity kept it somewhat competitive with its larger florida based cousin now its not even close disneyworld seems to have an endless budget to help your kids get lost in the fantasy especially characters dressed up everywhere at disneyland we only saw two characters the entire day the biggest difference is that because land is in the middle of the same million people every day its not just a target destination for traveling families but frequent fliers who are no where near as polite at allmost every line someone would cut in front and the employees just watched it was very upsetting to have your toddlers and children patiently wait minutes then have to watch typically locals people just step in front at the last second if you say anything you make a scene if front of your kids if you dont you are not a good role model i didnt pay several hundreds of dollars to have to deal with that the employees should as your kids get older disney overall isnt as much fun there are only a couple of thrill rides as compared to other amusement parks which have several having said all of that the park is clean and the kids had a good time ,2,2014-04-21
4197,Just what you'd expect from Disney,we bought a day hopper ticket for our trip to disneyland the plan being to have one day in this park and one day in california adventure and then the last day to hop between the two this was exactly the right thing to do as there were so many amazing things to do the attention to detail is typically disney nothing has been overlooked and the atmosphere in the park is second to none i have been to wdw orlando and disneyland paris and this was my second trip to disneyland and i loved it as much as ever the rides are great make use of the fastpass tickets and there is plenty to keep all members of the family happy every member of staff you come into contact with is so cheerful and give you such a good service there are loads of restaurants to choose from for meals and snacks and also lots of water fountains dotted around the park so you re not always having to buy drinks well done disney we ve had another fantastic holiday and look forward to the next one ,5,2014-04-20
4198,It's really the Happiest Place on Earth!,yes it s crowded and the lines are long but the experiences at disneyland even as an adult are truly memorable and magical my solution for the long lines first of all don t expect to do everything in one day second it s better if you get a two or three day two park pass to both disneyland and california adventure so you re able to space out your activities and your energy third plan ahead if you want to get on a certain ride get a fast pass or if you want to watch one of their nightly shows grab a hotdog and go an hour early to get a good seat with that said allow me to share two of my magical moments for this trip because yes i consider disneyland an attraction to visit my entire lifetime i went on two of my favorite rides cars and space mountain the moment we arrived at the park we got a fast pass to cars the fast pass to space mountain courtesy of a kind stranger at one of the main street restaurants the pm fireworks in front of sleeping beauty s castle was amazing i had several jaw dropping wow moments like when the shooting star appeared above the castle and when a real live tinkerbell start flying around just like it does at the start of every disney movie i m from the philippines and have had the opportunity to visit disneyland several times growing up going as an adult and now with my husband allows me to relive those happy childhood memories and make precious news ones ,5,2014-04-18
4199,Way Ove Ccrowded,disneyland and california adventure are great but way over crowded except in the early morning the lines are incredibly long for all of the key rides latter in the day we spent most of our time waiting in line even using the fastpass system we were lucky to be able to do three major rides in an afternoon ,3,2014-04-17
4200,Loved it!,i would love for them to really limit the people that go in the park there is way to many people in that really takes away from the experience tickets are very expensive you would think that you pay slot so you will have lots of fun ride in lots of rides but all those people trying to get in to ride it s even hard to walk or even get a good view of the park i am very disappointed my kids days where also ruined our first time there wasn t what i expected at all won t be going here anytime soon ,5,2014-04-13
4201,Really bad,nice park a bit crowded it is best to use the single rider lanes when available eat on off times check to be sure attractions are open many were closed for our visit ,2,2014-04-12
4202,Disneyland Oh-Yeah!,listen to the sounds of disneyland from the moment you walk through the gates your greeted by a character s restrooms to your right and on the right past the restrooms is mr lincoln it s incredible bd anniversary first time magical day buttons at city hall ice cream shop down main street on your left worth the wait adults due to long lines we ride indiana jones space mountain children rides fantasy land for nursing moms with crying hungry children winnie the pooh ride it rocks your baby perfect ride for all ages the parade is magical don t forget the fire work show sit by small world to your right and up the stairs places to sit if you want to see fantasmic water show you can get vip seating and after the show stay and watch the fireworks show its pp but worth it recommend going mid week and from am to close when your feet hurt small world enjoy the magic of what disneyland has to offer i do recommend going to disney california adventure enjoy your time ,3,2014-04-12
4203,"""Walt Disney would be Proud! ""MAGICAL in Every Way!",i first visited disneyland when i was more than years ago it was the greatest trip of my life now with two young children of my own i was anxious to go back we finally made it last week and the magic has only become more intense especially experiencing the park through the eyes of your kids disney does it right the park was meticulously clean the staff were all excellent and the attention to detail does not go unnoticed you truly get what you pay for i visited the baby centers in both dl and dca and was super impressed not only were the ladies in charge so sweet the centers were amazing with everything you could ever need for an infant food was so good too and it is fun trying all the different treats and restaurants fastpass system is a great idea we had an absolute blast and cannot wait to return we were there for days i think you need to really get it all done you need one day alone just to meet all the characters there were many attractions we didn t even get too radiator springs is a total marvel but years later my favorite ride is still splash mountain can t say enough good things ,5,2014-04-10
4204,The Magic Continues,disneyland always improves on itself and it seems like it is better every time i go great place to take family when they visit me in california every ride is kid friendly and won t snap your neck like six flags lol pirates is my favorite ride always has been i probably ride it twice on each visit disney s fastpass line reservation system works great and allows you to grab some food or hit one ride and then literally walk right onto another the staff are always upbeat and super nice ,5,2014-04-09
4205,Gets better every time I go,our family s first choice is disneyland we ve been to both disney world and disneyland twice on this trip to la we went again disneyland is distinctly different from disney world it s just as new as it always has been much more to see without the miles of walking at disney world not being a stranger to either disneyland may seem much smaller and therefore it should offer less depending on the time of year it can be crowded this is due to the more compact nature of the park actually it isn t a small adventure park at all but it may seem small compared to disney world with more acres of water grass scenery and walking than fun and rides disneyland is just the opposite it s all about fun rides and the magical kingdom disneyland brings back the kid in everyone after our first trip to disneyland florida s disney world was a let down in fact our teenage daughter was taken out of school for a spring business family trip to florida and disney world and she took her books we told her it would be fun and it was but it was not the disneyland she knew on the next trip to la we went back to disneyland over objections from both husband and teenage child and had a blast my husband and daughter stayed and wouldn t leave and we closed down the park with photos of mickey taken with us both my husband and teenage daughter remain disneyland enthusiasts personally i am a roller coaster fanatic and we have more fun and excitement in the time we spend at disneyland try if you can to experience the popular areas early or late have lunch or dinner when others are standing in line for those popular rides seems so logical and easy however it s hard to pace yourself and not rush to see everything instantly but if you plan just a little relax and make a day of the fun disneyland offers it s an experience you ll never forget ,5,2014-04-09
4206,Unforgettable & Magical - Everytime for Everyone!,disney world is huge but disneyland has more fun per square mile or at least it seems so the grand kids had been to disney world the last three years on spring break and now on to disneyland this year they were so impressed on how so many attractions could be placed in a single park they did say that disney world seems more relaxed and that people seem happier there but how might that be since disneyland is known as the happiest place on earth it was sad that a few rides were closed due to refurbishments but a ride on big thunder mountain railroad illustrated why it is so important for the process to take place so smooth with so many new touches waiting to be seen the choices for teens and what to do during the open hours are tough calls hmmm wait for space mountain or again or wait even longer for a chance to meet elsa anna thor or captain america how about a relaxing and entertaining show or two decide which parade is best so much to choose from nice to re live those experiences that time has enhanced ,5,2014-04-05
4207,most amazing trip ever,best family trip ever took people for spring break got great rates at a good neighbor hotel meal vouchers were a steal for out family and putting an extra day on passes for a total of days was very reasonable loved everything about the park and when my daughter fell and scraped her knee who was by the first aid station but marry poppins of course which made my little girl ever so happy and the world was a ok again nice touch disney,5,2014-04-02
4208,"Great expierence, but would like a heads up",we were at the park for day and then day at california adventure ride lines weren t to crazy and the kids had a great time we weren t able to see the fireworks night as rain and wind cancelled them my only complaint and maybe suggestion to disneyland would be to let people know ahead of time is a ride is shutdown for repairs kids were really excited to go o it s a small world but we didn t know it was down for upgrades repairs till we walked over to it other than that we had a great time ,4,2014-04-01
4209,Earthquake,paid a lot of money to end our trip quickly could not get on rides that we had a fast pass for since rides were closed and fast pass holders before us got to go on first by the time it was time for us the park was closing,3,2014-03-31
4210,"Food allergy excellence, Tips",super impressed over the handling of my husband s cheese allergy we have never experienced anyone in food service so well trained at handling this changing gloves utensils etc this was handled well at hungry bear blue bayou plaza inn and rancho del zocalo reviewers who say the food is too expensive aren t eating at the right places or getting the right meals the plaza inn s chicken dinner is and a ton of food at the hungry bear a good size burger chicken sandwich with fries for around for an enchilada platter at rancho we mostly drink water so that saves us the key to a great trip is to research plan for example you can view all menus prices online ahead of time or on your phone while there plan several months in advance for your trip we always get packages through get away today and got a free night hotel and a free day at the parks this trip plus a great price get books even if you ve been there before the unofficial guide and lots to do in line we went during busy spring break and had a great time because we planned ahead and used touring plans found in the unofficial guide and at touringplans com we got to the gate every day before the park opened i can t stress how important this is we also used the app mousewait on our phones to tell how long the lines were and when broken down rides reopened several rides broke down while we were there it is just inevitable during busy times but they always come back up and the good news is a breakdown during your fastpass time means you can use it any other time that day after the ride comes back up we got a locker every day in which we kept extra water bottles a change of shoes and sweatshirts for at night we also got ponchos before we left at wal mart for cents to use on splash mountain and grizzly river rapids at dca on our last night we gifted these so they could be re used to people waiting in line for splash mountain who were happy to get them we never waited in line more than minutes and usually less than that if you want to have a great visit plan for it ,5,2014-03-31
4211,Disneyland - All that I expected and more,i am years old but i was taken back to my childhood by my first visit to disneyland yes the lines can be long the longest wait was nearly an hour for the space mountain ride yes it was relatively crowded especially on friday night however there was always something else to see and do rather than focus on the thrill rides i sat and enjoyed an ice cream and watched the mad hatter and alice play musical chairs and other children s games with a group of enthusiastic youngsters the games and patter was accompanied by a ragtime piano the young lady who played alice was a sheer delight and the hatter was as quick and logically lateral as a mad hatter should be yes the new cars land ride was brilliant as were other rides but disneyland doesn t forget that simple pleasures like finding your way through the caves on tom sawyer s island and seeing how cartoon animation works can be equally enjoyable it was disneyland s variety that made it a wonderful experience for me and my year old companion lastly there was a quirky sense of fun and creativity invested in almost every ride or activity for example the california screamin roller coaster ride was accompanied by a whacky soundtrack that made it that much more fun we have all been to theme parks and been on rides but i think you will agree that none of those parks have the special ambience of disneyland it is the original and the best ,5,2014-03-31
4212,Tips on negotiating your way through DL,recommend you buy and read the unofficial guide to disneyland before you go made a big difference in line wait times by following their plan ,5,2014-03-29
4213,Our usual good experience marred by breakdowns and closings,we visited disneyland twice mar and mar th splash mountain broke down min cars broke down min matterhorn broke down m min toy story broke done closed space mountain broke down closed indiana jones was closed for refurbishment it s a small world was closed for for refurbishment finding nemo was closed for refurbishment our family has enjoyed many wonderful days in disney land but we have never experienced this level of brake down or closures what has changed ,3,2014-03-28
4214,"Like Crowds, go to Disneyland",we visited disneyland on a weekday and experienced lots of lines estimated wait times at attraction queues that were not truthful and tons of annual passport holders that descended on the park in the afternoon like an insect swarm i wrote a letter to disneyland and the response was rather shocking they sent along fast passes and invited me to return at my expense again you can read all about my experience and the letter disney sent at my dedicated web page about my experience at dizzyland info it is a fun read and everyone should read before visiting ,2,2014-03-25
4215,It is too crowded!,i bought a few annual passes for my kid thinking about the experience i had years ago i used to take my daughter to disneyland for years with annual passes and it was very nice however many things have changed my kid still likes going to disneyland it is a safe place ,2,2014-03-25
4216,"Walt, your flagship needs help.",spent a few days at the park with kids and grandkids march and thursday and friday as far as we knew it was not spring break and the composition of the crowd did not suggest that schools were out but the crowds were still overwhelming the grandkids were and at that age an hour or longer wait for most rides is burdensome and annoying this was our th trip so we are not unfamiliar with some secret moves go early get fast passes quickly but we also began to rely on a couple of smartphone apps that listed wait times problematically the wait times were awful all over both parks after a m a couple of major rides were noted on the website as closed for renovation but space mountain also closed without notice for most of a day as did the toy story arcade ride the park was unfailingly clean the roaming musical acts were always good for a quarter hour s entertainment and everyone was well behaved it was the glazed eyes of the adults that suggested this is no longer the happiest place on earth ,2,2014-03-25
4217,Truly the Happiest Place on Earth...,my girlfriends and i are all in our s and try to make a yearly trip to disneyland we are all native southern californians who grew up going to disneyland and it absolutely is a lovely nostalgic and magical place i can t see how someone with kids cannot have a good time but if you are an adult couple or group trying to determine if you want to go here is my local advice as much as i love it and find it a happy fun place to spend a day all of your significant others that did not grow up loving and going to disneyland do not understand why we like it so much and are so willing to pay so much money for one day if you only have a day and you are adults without children trying to decide what to do go to california adventure more grown up rides and they serve alcohol unlike disneyland and plan on doing of a day and having a nice dinner in downtown disney ,5,2014-03-24
4218,Spent days at the park,we were at the grand california hotel for a total of days nights and spent a good portion of our time at the park our first day there we took a welcome to disney tour cost was person with caa discount regular and we learned some interesting facts the tour also included immediate entry to a couple of rides pirates of the caribbean which is always lined up we were also given fast passes for a couple of rides for use anytime during that day they offered to make reservations for us at a selection of restaurants and at the end of the tour we were each given a lanyard and a collector pin well worth the money my husband also took the walk in walt disney s footsteps tour the next day and got a more intimate look at some of the park this tour also included entry to the peter pan ride which is also lined up from dawn to close and lunch the only thing we were disappointed with was the number of rides that were closed for refurbishing we counted at least during our stay also the indiana jones ride is constantly breaking down so if you want to take this ride pack a lot of patience it took us two tries before we got on but i heard a lot of people make comments about it being broken they even make a joke about it on the jungle cruise ride we also found that for the time we were there there was several shows rides that only operate friday to sunday as most of our stay was mon friday we missed out on several things ,4,2014-03-18
4219,"Actually, we went to California Adventure",i think disney finally has a completed california adventure park with the addition of cars land radiator springs racers is so much fun for all ages world of color night time show is not to be missed get fast passes for both these attractions first thing when entering the park radiator springs racers also has a single riders line if you don t mind your party getting slightly split up world of color is in my opinion i ve been to disney world times and disneyland times the best of all the night time shows i don t know how disney outdoes themselves but somehow they do ,5,2014-03-17
4220,Good family visit with 5 year old boy,absolutely terrible don t waste your money they need to have some cap on the number of visitors allowed in on any particular day the day we went there were so many people you could not move we had to stand in queues to get on rides for over an hour for a min ride after standing for hours for a couple of rides we had had enough and left in disgust the food was expensive and terrible and you also had to wait first to get served and the wait for a table to sit at don t bother ,4,2014-03-15
4221,What a waste of money,perhaps i had been spoiled by going to disneyworld so many times before and set my expectations to that level however i was truly shocked at how inferior disneyland was to disneyworld i will say that we did not go to the other park that you had to pay an additional for simply for that reason it was far too much money and it did not appear to be all that exciting so we stuck with disneyland our first visit was to it s a small world it was one of my travel partners favorites it was closed for repairs we then went to try one of doles pineapple drinks which you can only get at this park closed for the season we then went over to the runaway train ride closed for repairs and on and on it went it was shocking at how small it was and how they could charge full price and close half the rides i rarely write reviews this harsh but this was unacceptable especially when you factor in the huge ticket price in excess of each space mountain was open and that was fun and there were other rides that were enjoyable additionally the staff were helpful and friendly however the bad far outweighed the good perhaps a discount was in order given all that was closed or a list out front of the attractions that were closed so people were informed we arrived at and were headed home by pm a far cry from a visit to disneyworld in orlando ,1,2014-03-13
4222,What a Disappointment,waited minutes to get int space mountain it broke minute wait to see characters small world and nemo out of commission plus a few others that we not broken down plus the fact that nobody cares another joke is the magic hour from eight to nine you will spend at least half of that time in line we were there two hours and that was enough satisfaction is not guaranteed and disney does not care ,2,2014-03-13
4223,Time to fix your attractions,it was my first visit to disneyland and i must say i was not impressed compared to disney world pretty much half the park was shut down for refurbishment so it made an already small park even smaller i understand maintenance but they really should really do a few at a time instead of all at once disney is still a magical happy place regardless but they should do something different at disneyland ,1,2014-03-11
4224,Slightly disappointing,some disappointment some rides closed and some braking down disneyland needs an upgrade tomarrowland is now yesterdayland yes the money has gone into the california adventure but it is time to reinvest back into the the original park ,4,2014-03-09
4225,DISNEYLAND RIDES CLOSED,i never thought that i would be writing a critical review of disneyland yes we went in february but never expected that major attractions would be closed very very disappointed ,4,2014-03-08
4226,Please don't bring a stroller! Bring warm clothes for after sundown and store them in a locker.,if you re going to disneyland please don t bring a child that is so young that they re in a stroller you will be wasting your money they won t appreciate it at that age and it is a royal pain for others to have to avoid strollers all day long and for you to have to maneuver it around having said that disney is one of the most famous tourist destinations in the world and well worth a visit of course it s not cheap but we had the california resident tickets which helped expect to pay for parking as well unless you are staying at a nearby hotel that will let you park there and you can walk to disneyland like we did we spent the weekend in anaheim and visited both disneyland and california adventure i found the latter to be my favorite now as it s newer fresher and feels more spacious get to either park right on opening to really make the most of your day and to get on some of the big rides early fyi they do a bag check on entry in feb when we visited major attractions were down splash mtn small world and big thunder mtn which was a bit disappointing but i guess they have to do maintenance sometime it was also superbowl weekend so we thought the rides would be quiet but we were wrong the longest we waited was hours in california adventure for the cars ride we had made reservations for the blue bayou restaurant which you see from the pirates of the caribbean ride it was very expensive the food was very average and although i m glad we had the experience not sure if i would recommend it if you can pull it off stay late for the fireworks above the castle they were spectacular for your convenience get a locker on main street about for a small locker where you can put your jackets you ll need them once the sun goes down winter or summer as it gets quite cold in socal after dark if you found this review useful please click yes ,5,2014-03-05
4227,Magical,truly magical disneyland is not your average theme park this was like stepping into a whole new world one where dreams come to life first of all the park it self is gorgeous the landscaping and decor is beautiful and you can see the effort put into the details it all creates a magical atmosphere to experience the park you need at least a day we had one day and a half and we were able to do almost every ride ride highlights were space mountain pirates of the caribbean haunted mansion and indiana jones and we never had to wait too long for the rides maximum time we waited was minutes we did not use any fast passes during our stay the cast members are so friendly and helpful especially the characters that are in the park they definetely make everyone who gets to meet them feel special only problem was a few times we reached the line to get an autograph and photo with one of the characters and a cast member informed us that the line was being cut off because the character was leaving this happened quite a few times but we did find the characters again later the merchandise sold at the park is quite over priced too but they had a good variety of items even though they were over priced the food there was actually quite good not at all what you expect there are many different options like cafes cafeteria buffet style restaurants and full service restaurants there are places for food all around the park and they are themed differently depending on the land you are in the food is not too expensive either mickey s soundsational parade was fabulous too and the fireworks show was unbelievable that is definetely a must if in disneyland remember to bring good walking shoes you will need them ,5,2014-03-01
4228,amazing....,we spent days at disney with our twin year olds i have to say the look on my daughters face was unforgettable it was a bigger deal to my daughter with all the princesses around than my son that is until he mat jake and peter pan its something i wish i d experienced when i was a child they played tag with peter pan and merida those two were the best characters in the whole park had a bouncing contest with tigger and so much more i couldn t list it all here i want to send a shout out to heather from the winnie the pooh ride she was awesome the twins got a button for being the first one to the ride for the day and so much more she was exactly what i would envision to be the the best type of employee for a disneyland park i hope someone sees this review and gives her the tip of the hat that she is due same goes for merida and peter top notch characters to be sure ,5,2014-02-24
4229,quick run down from someone who grew up in the park almost,both parents worked here for about years now my brother works here so yeah ive heard it all adn seen it all a few quick tips go if you have never been does this need said prepare to wait do fastpass dark rides take forever those are fantasyland rides like pan alcohol not sold in disneyland it is sold in dca disney cali adventure best food blue bayou but not really worth price unless you have money to burn and this is a one time trip but reserve reserve reserve the other is bengal tiger just skewers but so yummy another decent option is mexican place in adventureland now best bargain is potatoes across from splash good cheap and filling always check website to see what major ride is closed ie thunder currently longest lines in the park subs being re done again toon town coaster dumbo pan alice basically all of fantasyland except carousel and snow white then its splash and space they move decent not like f land but they are just super popular best parade spot main street on the curb fastest lines pirates treehouse canoes actually this is always just short lol small world and matterhorn it used to be faster now its eh mansion best time to come hands down christmas time here is a sight to see least busy time to come off season ie when school is in and no major holidays are around sept early oct end jan feb certain spots in spring and during the week ie wed have fun and be safe days defined super slow day min wait for space adn splash on a non rainy non cold day slow day min wait for the above good day min wait for above busy day min wait for above very busy day hr wait for above insane day over wait for above rides basically go home cause you are screwed how do you know what days are busy majority of holidays special event days and in general look at pass holder calendar block out days are busy days heres your sign note rain negates all the above most of the time ,5,2014-02-18
4230,Ski Week School Break…shoulda gone skiing,splash mountain closed thunder mountain closed haunted mansion stalled times in one ride space mountain closed at beginning of magic hour three year old boys hoping to get the fun rides in for the first pre park hours ugh we were so disappointed cast member says to me oh this is our slow season we do all of our maintenance now me ummm i paid the full price and this is a week off for many california schools and really we stayed overnight at the grand californian to walk in the park early only to find out no one told me during check in or reservations that on tuesday s it is early in at the other park yes that is right the one with all the e ticket rides closed ugh fair warning to all ,2,2014-02-18
4231,All Day Disney FUN!,great time at disneyland hrs each day we were there we went feb and thought it would be less crowded in the low season but disney does many refurbishments on their rides during the low season so with splash mtn big tunder mtn small world nemo subs closed this made all the other attractions very crowded however if you work your fastpasses well you can see everything you want with a max min wait also a tip is to get radiator springs fast pass right away in the morning and then grab another for any other attraction you want ie tower of terror you can do this because rsprings is disconnected to the fastpass system so you can hold fastpasses at once its a bit complicated i know but if you do you research and plan out which rides have fastpasses than you will have a magical disney time ,5,2014-02-16
4232,Awesome with a Little Planning,i ve always been more of a six flags magic mountain kind of guy any time i think about going back to disneyland the ticket prices always steer me in the direction of the mountain or the nearby farm well i decided a few months ago that years was long enough while disney won t break any height or speed records what they excel at is completely immersing you in the ride experience once you re in the park the outside world ceases to exist it s easy to get caught up in the whole happiest place on earth thing despite the constant crowds of course the best way to beat the crowds is to take advantage of fastpass the best tip is to always get your next fp before you use your current one make note of the time at the bottom where it says another fastpass ticket will be available after other than that the posted wait times at each ride are fairly accurate you can also download an app like mousewait it even helps you find the nearest restroom disneyland is simultaneously a ton of fun and a ton of work but with a little planning you can quite easily make the most of your day ,5,2014-02-09
4233,Absolutely Magical,this was our first time going to disneyland and to be honest it was a lifelong dream of mine to go and experience the magic that was disney from all the incredibly detailed and thrilling rides to all the various shows nothing disappointed in order to fit in as much as you can into one day ensure you get there before the park opens and head straight to space mountain lines for this ride can become incredibly long within the first hours of the day you can pretty much get all of the main thrill rides done twice space mountain star tours indiana jones splash mountain pirates of the carribean after that you have the day to wander the park and use fastpasses for other rides one surprisingly standout ride is the haunted mansion which at the time was christmas themed and even had a room smelling of desserts we would like to make a special mention of the employee working at splash mountain on the morning of the th december who really made our day extra special by giving us inside tips on how to make the most of our time ,5,2014-02-09
4234,Disnely World Is Better,while we enjoyed our time at both parks we like disneyworld better why do i say this please allow me to break it down pin trading pin trading is better at dw because pretty much every cast member does it there are also a lot more pins to choose from at dl you buy a starter pack and you re lucky if you are able to trade out the set before the end of the day while at dw you end up running of trash pins almost with in the first two hours we were disappointed by the limited number of people and places to trade pins with food there are more places in dw that are sit down and with food of higher quality preparation and nutritional value dl has a very limited selection crowds dw being bigger and more spaced out doesn t feel to us at least as crowed even on high capacity days dl feel crowded even when the numbers are on the lower side due to the the park being smaller and having more annual pass holders cleanliness and upkeep i could be wrong about this but it feels like dw is where all the money goes dl feels like they just keep it up and running since they already have the park there stuff needed painting noticed some broken stuff etc cast members dw cast members seem to enjoy their jobs more friendlier more joyfull and personable dl cm seemed like dead that all being said i ll talk about our trip last month we still had a good time despite the lines only had at most a minute wait time and we did get some cool pins they only thing that really made our trip less enjoy able were the people that cut lines several times we would be waiting in line for like minutes or more and we would hear behind us excuse me excuse me excuse me to have the person or persons more often then not push there way all the way up the line to meet with a group i m sorry but if you didn t get in line with them then they can come to you it s not fair to the people you just excuse me ed past what really grinds my gears if you had enough and you refuse to let them by then you re the jerk seriously grrrrrr anyway while we still had fun we are going to choose disneyworld in the future ,3,2014-02-08
4235,Hey it's Disney,this was part of a week family trip to southern california our group consisted of adults and children disney was the primary reason we stopped in anaheim with little girlies in tow it was just about mandatory we ve taken trips to disney paris in the past years so our goal wasn t really to make this the higlight of our vacation we purchased southern california passes in advance which included days entry to both of the anaheim disney parks we went half days and full i ll go through some of the the positives and n gatives below funny story at first my daughter refused to believe it was actually disneyland she knew we weren t in paris and the park entrances are different upon entering the park we were asked to provide a photo in case our passes were stolen my wife agreed but i wouldn t have as i don t agree with giving these types of things to big corporations willingly this wasn t as bad as universal studios asking for finger prints but it s still a bit out there for my liking our first day was planned to stay at the actual disney park versus the california theme park this worked out until the halloween party started and then we were kicked out because we hadn t paid whatever further fee there was we weren t even given the chance to pay the extra and stay other than accommodation meals disney was the most expensive part of our trip and i was none to pleased to have paid my money just to get told to leave on the plus side the other park was open and we enjoyed ourselves there more than at disney itself plenty of characters running around and of course we took plenty of photos with mickey daisy minnie goofy there was a lack of princesses and this was a bit of a dissapointment for the girls but this could be a good thing as well as i once spent hours waiting for a picture with ariel we did run into cinderella but the line had already been cut off i fully understand that playing a character must be difficult i wouldn t do it and that they probably want to stick to the schedule as strictly as possible but my daughter just wanted to say hi show her cinderella dress no photo or conversation would have been needed i was pretty sad for my little girl when cinderella blew her off there were plenty of rides that were age appropriate for the kids for the ones that the baby couldn t go on my wife waited and i took a baby swap pass which alowed her to go back with our older daughter without having to wait in the main line again it s a nice program and my older daughter obviously made out like a bandit on the rides the evening light show is something not to miss show up early if you want a decent spot however we had a group of people in front of us that took all their strollers up front with them which took up alot of space when my wife asked them to put them in the back area they were quite rude about it and absolutely refused even when other families started complaining with us although not really the fault of the park they could perhaps have staff keep a better eye on such things my daughter was h ll bent on getting an ariel dress we looked in quite a few stores but couldn t find one not even in the little mermaid themed souvenir store an employee was kind enough to track one down for us and have the store reserve the last one in our daughter s size bravo and kudos to the somewhat older lady working in the little mermaid gift store there are a few different smoking areas which is nice compared to the i found at universal studios but they re still rare i don t mind too much as long as i don t have to run half the park for a minute break from the kids it s better than sitting in line having to smell other peoples smoke all the time and exposing the kids to it my kids think that i m a non smoker as i never smoke around them just an idea but it might be nice to put a few small restroom areas near the rides with longer lines i think we had waited an hour or so for the cars themed ride that features cars going around a track when my daughter strated needing to use the restroom with the wife waiting for us with the baby we would have had no one to keep our place and would have just spent an hour waiting for nothing most of the lines were actually pretty decent when we visited and i don t remember any really long waits of course we tended to stay with rides that were age appropriate for the children so i never ended up in the hour or so line for the tower of terror or whatever it was called one evening we managed to get on the big roller coaster times in about half an hour i admit to liking roller coasters but my year old would have gone on the thing times had they not finally closed for the evening while i understand that there are alot of liability issues in the u s i don t particularly appreciate having the ride operator announce times over the loud speaker that the baby can t ride on my shoulders in the boat when i m actually still in line and will be for the next minutes i could understand if i was being stupid and tried to get into the boat with her on my shoulders but let s not go to the other extreme of idiocy either food while i didn t see anything that would really qualify as fine dining there are a few nicer dining options in the park most of it is take and go park food but that could be expected it is a park afterall most of the better restaurants are actually in the disney village but we only exercised this option once in order to hit the rain forest cafe with the kids as usual there is the standard park upcharge on food items captive audience charge what you want to conclude i guess i could go on for another hour or so but in the end it is what it is it s disney and it s hard to go wrong with disney and children are there stressors of course but they re quite minor compared to running around a strange country and planning as you go it s all right there for you entertainment that most any kid will love shops starbucks characters parades light shows restaurants candy etc it s almost a no brainer for any parent bring your wallet nothing is cheap but i suppose there are options for most any budget it was a nice family trip that was enjoyed by all no major complaints other than the early closure the one night and plenty of fond memories ,4,2014-02-06
4236,Such a pity so many attractions were closed,we ve just spent three days at disneyland in anaheim we really enjoyed it and loved the park it was clean friendly and lots of fun there were several disappointments however we re from australia so this was our only opportunity to spend time in the park possibly forever as a family as our last child has just finished school let me list the attractions that were closed big thunder mountain railroad disneyland railroad finding nemo submarine voyage it s a small world we visited hong kong disney two years ago and this ride was also closed sailing ship columbia splash mountain i think that this was part of the reason that rides such as star tours fabulous and indiana jones also fabulous were so crowded two of the more exciting rides were down also of note peter pan broke down after we d already stood in line for thirty minutes and the haunted mansion also broke down while we were there now i know that there is always a big need for maintenance but the sheer number of rides that were unavailable at one time suggests that perhaps there might be an issue with this or possibly the age of some of the attractions at the park apart from that well it s disneyland and full of colour sound entertainment wonderful parades which we watched every day a great fireworks display and food that was not too bad for a theme park we are still wondering about the giant pickles though must be a us thing ,4,2014-02-06
4237,Must to do in LA,good enternteiment good photos good for everybody if you are short on time like myself you can do both parks in one day choose one day that the park close at night some attractions sold out the fast pass in first hours of day run to reserve it i started my day on adventureland and finished in other park just in front it requers a hop on pass more expensive ,5,2014-02-02
4238,Loved this place.,we loved disneyland got crowded just before christmas so avoid holiday periods and take advantage of past passes all staff so friendly and park clean we liked this better than magic kingdom at walt disney world just a couple more things and it s a small world heaps better ,5,2014-02-02
4239,Bipity Boppety Boo,our little princess loved the bipity boppety boo salon and she had a makeover the look like belle then met her favorite princesses great visit friendly staff ,5,2014-02-01
4240,Disneyland is amazing,i was here with my friends and we went here early in the morning as we bought the day hopper park ticket to both parks i can highly recommend this if you are visiting disneyland without children as there are many attractions only for children it was an great experience i loved the splash mountain space mountain and indiana jones very nice attractions i can highly recommend to start early in the morning where you start with this park and when you gets hungry for lunch enter the other park california adventure in the california park we ate at the restaurant wine country trattoria which were really good remember to wear comfortable shoes as you gonna walk a lot ,5,2014-02-01
4241,Magical place to play!,okay this is going to cost you disneyland is expensive but it s an amazing place to spend time with your family go knowing that there will be crowds and lines but it s pure magic ,5,2014-01-30
4242,Another great visit ... (before Christmas),our family of went to disneyland for the third time but it was our youngest child s yrs old first visit disneyland is so great to visit around the holidays due to all of the extra decorations and lights especially when lit up at night the wait times during the day seemed to be manageable but once the late afternoon hits the locals like to come down to enjoy the festivities too which made disneyland very busy at night overall this was another great disney trip with the highlights haunted mansion it s a small world fireworks in front of the castle fantasmic see my other review splash mountain indiana jones matterhorn bobsleds star tours new and improved buzz lightyear since our oldest child years old was tall enough to go on all of the amusements rides it made this trip extra special our kids can t wait to go back and neither can we advice if you have young kids i would recommend bringing a stroller as kids can get pretty tired from all of the walking plus it s very expensive to rent a stroller for the day i think also if your kids want to meet the frozen movie characters get in line early as there were long line ups for anna and elsa during our visit ,4,2014-01-28
4243,Disneyland family trip,had a great time the lines were moving quickly didn t wait more than mins for any rides food was over priced but good selection the parade was especially awesome ,5,2014-01-27
4244,Beer in Disneyland!,liked everything especially blue moon beer and jalape o cream cheese stuffed pretzels sorry that the new cars ride was broken ,5,2014-01-25
4245,Its Disneyland,its the place of kids and adult dreams its also where you turn yourself over the logistics of disney getting into the park can be frustrating as their entry procedures can cause you to be stuck behind the family of getting photos taken for their day passes and simply amazing as you enjoy breakfast with your favorite characters in the plaza inn you ll forget the problems because the magic of the park keeps the smile on your face ,4,2014-01-24
4246,a nightmare come true!,it was so over crowded that the dream did turn into a nightmare one could not stand stil keep mooving any staff member would shout no kindness no magic whatsoever i would never ever go back on new years eve again it was disrespectfull to people that pay a lot of money for the tickets travel great distances and find themselves treated like cattle or worse ,1,2014-01-24
4247,Not Too Busy,disneyland and california adventure were not very busy the days we visited we did most of both parks within a two day stay ,5,2014-01-19
4248,Really good but not what I expected.,i am from melbourne and have only been to the themeparks in queensland so i was expecting a big step up which i didn t really get certainly the attention to detail was much more impressive and the experience of the ride was where they have heavily invested but for the waiting lines the rides for me failed to deliver i was looking for more of a mix between experience and thrill but there was no thrill to speak of we did the park in one day and if you aren t with kids and know how to use the fastpass system this was plenty of time we had actually been on all the fastpass rides by pm and could have fit in california adventure in the same day we were there on the first monday kids were back to school however in saying this it was still a great time and i would go back but for people looking for a bit more thrill i would recommend california adventure ,4,2014-01-16
4249,Expected so much more......,have been going to florida for thirty years for disney world i was raised on the best customer service the friendliest people the cleanest parks the open spaces then we decided to mix it up and come to california for the first time i know it s the left coast gang infested a billion in debt but i m going to see disneyland what could go wrong man the good well the matterhorn macaroons were amazing fried green tomato sandwich was great the bad horrible customer service they were at best indifferent to guests very few people were friendly i could go on and on but just know this if you have been to disney world skip disneyland i wish someone had warned me you have been warned haha ,1,2014-01-14
4250,Importance for planning,i visit there for christmas season so the castle every little thing in the park were dressed up and it was so cute and the staff took us the picture in the front of big christmas tree with panorama mode by my camera so the whole of beautiful huge christmas tree was in it it was really impressed and we could get so beautiful picture sometime its so crowed in the park but we didnt need to wait in the line so long we didnt get fast pass though but there re a lot restaurant had long line or for only reservation if you want to enjoy there efficiently you should check the map or more information and should plan what you want to do in there they have no student discount nor military discount ,4,2014-01-12
4251,It really is the happiest place on Earth!,i am a disneyland fanatic visited in december with a friend she is lacking her inner child did not really want to go and even she said at the end of the day she had a really fun time it was beautiful that time of the year with all the christmas decorations and themed rides we did everything in one day indiana jones ride was probably our favourite we enjoyed having louisianna style food for lunch because our trip didn t afford us enough time to make it to the south so even though i m sure it s not authentic it hit the spot i do think the hong kong disneyland is better probably because when i was there it was less of a crowd but other than that really can t fault the place if i could come here everyday i would and can t wait to one day come back ,5,2014-01-05
4252,Magical,one of my childhood dreams came true when i visited disneyland it s a magical place with such an awesome happy feeling even waiting in lines wasn t a hassle as everyone is waiting and noone complains going at christmas was amazing the decorations were amazing and the parades are fabulous the people who work at disney are the best staff ever very happy and kind and professional they always ensure that the children in your group have a special welcome we loved our trip and one day hope to go back hint get a day pass at least you ll need it if you want to go on all the rides and experience what they have to offer fast pass whatever you can so convenient and you can go on other rides until your fast pass time if you ve seen the fireworks and want to go on rides pop over to california adventure at fireworks time and the lines are shorter and there are less people go early there s a magic morning that you can go an hour earlier than the official opening time and also go later in the evening after the fireworks as there are less people try the stuffed jalape o pretzel yum if you re hot go to splash mountain you will get splashed watch out for mobility scooter drivers and pushchairs they re everywhere hahaha have fun ,5,2014-01-03
4253,"Lines too long, paid for tickets and almost couldn't enter",when we first bought our tickets for about for the group of us we were expecting an easy entry with my child but they cut off the line because it was full capacity and that meant since we only got a one day pass even though we paid for the tickets we won t be able to enter lucky my quick thinking rushed us to another line where they were still accepting so that wasn t wasted or so i thought as we queued up for our first ride it took a huge slice three hours of our entire day just to go on a little five minute ride disneyland had almost no regard for us standing in the baking sun at all my son was already tired but to not waste we got on another ride which was another long and arduous queue right now we had spent and hours of our family s limited time in america for minutes of entertainment the rides were good though we were all exhausted and bored so after that we hustled home wasted and our energy and day for only two rides in my photos it was almost hilarious seeing our son s excited face after a ride at disneyland sarcastic not happy they certainly should do something about the queues ,2,2014-01-01
4254,It's all about the timing. (from a seasoned Disney addict),this review will be for disneyland and disney california adventure parks this review will be lengthy but full of tips my young family of five just got back from disneyland and california adv we went in early mid december we had a great time it s all about how busy disney is if it s busy you probably won t have a very good time if it s not busy you are more likely to have a good time my first advice is never go on weekends holidays or a week before christmas all the way to new years i ve never been in the summer so i cannot tell you about that but they say it s busy the disneyland cast members were excellent some people have complained but in my week long experience we never had a grumpy cast member every now and then we got a you can t stand here you cannot lean there you have to walk this way which can be annoying the worst of this came when we lined up in hollywood land early one morning to cut through bugs land as soon as they dropped the ropes we were trying to access the new radiator springs racers ride at park opening as we walked through bugs land to access cars land there was a worker there blocking the way and told us we could not cut through here at this time so we had to walk all the way back to the main street and get behind hundreds of people to access cars land through the main entrance just to let you know people line up for a fast pass for this ride every morning and it sells out within an hour or so disney needs to do a better job by informing people early on that they cannot go this way during this time or list it on the park map or something or just let people through fyi you cannot access cars land bugs land in the early morning minus that hiccup that crashed most of our day we had great success on the other days i feel bad for people who show up to disney parks for the first time and don t really know the ins and outs also there were a few rides that would close down multiple times throughout the day they were mostly racers and space mtn if you are planning a trip you have to plan for unexpected closures tip if radiator springs racers breaks down don t leave the area go sit down on the benches and wait we did this and minute later they were up and running and we were the first in line cast members will try to get you to leave but as long as you are sitting down they ll leave you alone you can check allears net for scheduled ride closures one reviewer also mentioned that disney runs half staffed during what should be slower times and make for longer lines i believe this is a possibility another possibility is that on less crowded days they claim to have broken down rides so they cut operating costs for example my family woke up early one morning to go on finding nemo submarines because this line is typically long and there is no fastpass offered we showed up early we were the first people to show up at the ride the line attendant told us that the captain has not showed up yet so we stuck around a little bit hoping they d show up soon i asked is the captain truly not here yet she said no we just tell people that because it sounds cool i believe they were just trying to defer people to other rides until it became busy enough to justify powering up the ride this can be frustrating but once we learned the way they operate we just went on space mtn which had minimal wait then came back later and we had a short wait one ride that seemed to always have a min wait was peter pan s flight the ever popular fantasyland ride we showed up early for this one but it still was at min i admit this is the only ride i wanted to go on that we didn t go on because there was no way around the min wait unless you are first at the gates in the morning but at the same rate you are still waiting a long time to get through the gates overall our trip was still very magical no one does it like disney our daughter yrs loved to interact with all the characters she believed they were real we never waited more than minutes for a ride cast members gave my kids free reg pirate guns the cars land is absolutely astounding and majestic the three rides there exceeded my expectations my favorite restaurant is the pacific warf cafe i love their soup in a sourdough bread bowl cast members were always kind to us and tried to make our experience good tips fast passes get a fast pass early to a favorite ride stay in the area until it is due then get another for the same ride or another near by fast pass ride a new one becomes available right when your return time starts popular rides like indiana jones and space mountain were very clear at park opening try to stay in one area at a time and don t get fast passes to all different areas of the park otherwise you ll be walking a ton never never stand in a line longer than min especially if you are here on a weekday and especially if you have young children with you usually there will be a shorter line nearby and the ride will probably ease up a bit later otherwise get a fast pass or show up first thing in the morning with young children either take a break in the middle of the day or get done by pm all day at disneyland is too much for young kids and parents hauling young kids make sure you bring a stroller or rent one ,4,2013-12-22
4255,Not the happiest place on earth anymore,i took the family to disneyland for some fun and it was fun the first day however not so much the second day fyi don t complain to any of the workers there i seen it happen twice in a matter of an hour on both ends of the park a lady walked up and complained talking normal not rising her voice or being aggressive and asked to speak with someone about a complaint and they called security on her within seconds the old folk security crew was surrounding her so she said forget it and left then at the gate where they check bags a lady put her purse on the table for them to check but left the strap around her neck and they yelled at her yes i said yelled at her then called security when she asked to speak to the manager i am glad that i paid there over priced tickets so i could see that ,2,2013-12-16
4256,Big disappointment!,biggest disappointment was the rides breaking down after hours in line so crowded and plus while in line for a ride people were just cutting in front of you trying to get to a family member already in line for them thats so rude and first time in my life there were no fire works show it was crazy crowded this time of year its my favorute to go to disneyland not planning on going next year ,2,2013-12-15
4257,The most expensive place on earth,as my boyfriend and myself were out to venture a wonderful day at our favorite beloved location we were terribly disappointed it was about noon as we had started to develop an appetite so i decided to call the thunder barbecue ranch restaurant and make a reservation i had looked up the phone number online and called and had a nice conversation with the cast member i had asked if it was all you can eat as i could recall from my last visit years ago and she replied yes its per person she had explained to me the possibility of a cancellation fee and had asked for my card number to set the reservation on i cheerfully explained to her that my boyfriend and my self were happy to find this place for its cheap price and our extremely small budget considering that we re college freshmen around christmas time shopping for our families soon our budget for food for the entire day was so around our reservation time we had arrived and sat at a table we received no menus except the dessert menu we ate the delicious food and had a small talk with the other group seated at our table we had explained to them what the cast member on the telephone had communicated to us of the per person drinks included in the all you can eat and the desserts were excluded etc as the waitress appeared the other group had inquired about it and the waitress had informed us that the food was per person and the cancellation fee was per person we were absolutely upset about our new findings we had explained to the waitress of what we were told and how we only had a certain amount of money for the rest of the day and our budget we were so upset because of the miscommunication and that we unknowingly had spent about the waitress was wonderful and expressed her apologies for the misunderstanding and had tried to see what she could do for us at the end of the lunch she had told us sorry they said that the price was displayed on the website too and we can t do anything about it i had told her that i had only searched for the phone number and intended to ask more information during the phone call of which i was misinformed she still said there was nothing she could do after this my boyfriend and myself found ourselves broke we had barely enough to pay for the dinner and our day was ruined we intended to only spend on food and no money on anything else we ended up spending that day and my boyfriend found out he lost his job on the same day we later went to city hall to graciously tell our story and to explain of our misunderstand and the miscommunication of the cast member who made the reservation the cast member at city hall took my name and said he was going to listen to the phone recording and see what happened so he went to the back room and we waited about minutes he came back out and told us that he had talked to the woman who was on the phone with us and she had told him that she established the price and the person was only the cancellation fee he told us there was absolutely nothing to do for us he was a very ignorant and arrogant worker who had no intention of helping from the very beginning we left city hall for minutes or so seeing as how we were greatly upset by the horrible customer service as i perfectly remembered the conversation with the woman i specifically told her that we were on a low budget and happy to hear of somewhere inexpensive to eat this was right after she expressed the price was person of which i understood was the buffet cost i thought it over and remembered how the city hall cast member said he would listen to the phone recording but later came back and said he had only spoke to her and she said she had established the buffet fee we went back and had asked him to listen to the recording he said we don t record our phone calls and i called him out on telling us that he was going to listen to the recording we also told him how we told the woman of our low budget after she told us the fee he had said yes she told me that but i didn t think i should bring it up he went back to his supervisor to see what could be done but when he came back he explained that there was nothing they could do and that the woman said she explained the fee there was no menu to display the buffet fee and nobody had bothered to explain it as we entered the thunder barbecue ranch now my review is not solely based on the lack of display of the buffet fee but particularly to the horrible customer service as it is supposed to be the happiest place on earth they did absolutely nothing to ensure us of continuing our day to be a good day at the park he was very arrogant lied about listening to the phone call and offered nothing for our horrible experience im very disappointed as a huge socal disney fanatic i will have to say that i m not sure of another trip to the park even after my or so visits it is easy to see that the business is all about money and this place does not stand by the place where wishes come true or the customer is always right i was not requesting a refund at all a discount for the miscommunication would have been fine or anything to make our day better after the disappointment but this was never the city hall cast members intention very disappointed and i hope he gets fired he was not an appropriate worker for a place that assures customer satisfaction ,3,2013-12-13
4258,experience,too busy and realized that all resturant seating are outdoor how come there is no indoor seating the weather is not always hot hot hot too long wait and not everything has fast pass ,3,2013-12-12
4259,Rides are very brief relative to my expectations,we went to visit disneyland s california adventure park to see cars land and to try the cars land racers ride each ride we good was very very short probably to keep the lines moving we have been to disney world orlando which felt like you were getting a little more for your money ,3,2013-12-12
4260,The Most Crowded Place On Earth!,it is literally painful for me to write this review and only give disneyland an average rating i grew up going to disneyland my husband and i are huge disney nerds we visit disneyland and disney world once a year we planned our annual disneyland california adventure trip for the monday and tuesday following thanksgiving we don t have kids and we both have jobs that are generous with vacation time so we re able to carefully plan our trips to disney around times when there are low crowds my husband has an app with a crowd predictor for all of the disney parks it s usually pretty right now it was this time around as well at least in the morning in the afternoon all of the annual passholders begin to arrive for the evening activities at this point the parks become so crowded it s downright annoying working my way through the crowds made me feel like a fish swimming upstream we are true fans we take the time to do all the special tours this time around we did the walk in walt s footsteps tour guided by summer rose who was amazing this tour was really worth the time and money i would recommend it to anyone who loves the man behind the mouse we still had a great trip i was just so frustrated by the crowds not to mention how rude people become when they re all crammed into small spaces so i would recommend a visit to disneyland without kids and make sure to bring your patience and a major credit card ,3,2013-12-05
4261,Planning tips to enjoy your trip,it s the happiest place on earth i have to agree however some planning will help you enjoy wish someone compiled this for us hence doing it now don t drive if you can use public transportation and book a place within mins walking distance the doubletree inn on harbor blvd is excellent for value see my review for it it will take you longer to park ride the tram then getting a shuttle plan the rides in advance based on your child s interests fear factor and height requirements last thing you want to do is line up for one hour to find out that your child does not like the ride because of fear of the dark or it s too scary definitely take advantage of fast pass and latest mobile apps to keep track of wait time go to disney com for the apps information if your little one wants to see the princesses but on a tight budget forgo the dining with the princesses and wait in the long line to see them in the royal hall however if you have the budget just do it read up on the shows some of them are awesome and worth the wait but schedule it wisely for example do the shows in afternoon when the ride lines are long and go on the rides at night if you can of course have to factor in bedtime but hey you re in disneyland forget about the bedtime disney is getting better about the quality of the food and healthy choices but still bring your own healthy food and save money protein bars packaged nuts sugared ginger energy while waiting in the heat and long line and high fiber bars glitter ones and even us forget about our fruits and veggies don t forget the water check for discount via corporate deals costco sam clubs aaa and etc ,5,2013-12-02
4262,Holidays Don't Disappoint at Disneyland,we visited on november and the first two days were blissfully slow and wonderful in every way i think we waited minutes for the more popular rides but basically walked on everything else friday and saturday were both quite busy and the more popular rides were minutes to an hour wait take advantage of fast passes as since they ve changed the policy on these they really are fast the holiday season is a really fun time to visit the decorations are beautiful the entertainment is top notch and the characters are in fun holiday attire ask a cast member near a character where you can see a specific character and they ll pull out a schedule and tell you right where to go that way you can see who you want and won t waste time don t miss the jingle jangle jamboree in frontierland it was so much fun it s kind of tucked away behind big thunder mountain but well worth making the trek they have a petting zoo until every day with goats sheep and a little donkey this is where you can see the billy hill and the hillbillies show which is funny and entertaining you can buy a little cookie decorating kit for and they have lots of tables where you can sit and relax the night that we went we were able to see a fair amount of characters too mickey minnie pluto goofy the country bears santa and mrs claus were all walking around greeting people pluto played a game with my daughter and the country bears were doing a dance that we were invited to participate in it was a very unique experience and my daughter is still talking about it we saw a couple of other shows that were also really good the fantasy fair vaudeville type show was very funny and mickey and the magical map was entertaining the parade was fun and the fireworks were brilliant disneyland is always very fun but the holiday season adds a little something extra we were so glad to be able to go at this time of year again ,5,2013-12-01
4263,"losing some charm in remodeling, also breaking down, overcrowded",let s move past the fact that major rides broke down maybe it was just a bad day disney seems to be moving away from charming and just selling out tom sawyer s island is mostly pirate themed now with no fort no treehouse and most caves closed it was awful submarine ride replaced animatronics with underwater video screens and you basically watch clips from nemo no mermaids atlantis or sea monsters anymore i want to go on an adventure not re watch movie clips through a porthole the star tours ride featured literally a hit and run on chewbacca who you leave for dead it is supposed to be funny the way he splats on the windshield but then they re use the same windshield splat gag two more times with a bug and a sea monster we went during the christmas season so some rides had been re themed they did a great job with the haunted house but it s a small world replaced the song with jingle bells so you only hear a couple snatches of the original song love it or hate it the ride needs the original song at least do half and half also no hanukkah in it or any other winter holiday even though diversity is the point of the ride huh tarzan s treehouse is missing a lot of the cool features it has when it was swiss family robinson s treehouse the jungle cruise renamed jingle cruise for the season was supposed to be holiday themed but that only meant they wore santa hats and told holiday themed jokes really that s it the park was terribly overcrowded to the point of not being able to move and i notice that several rides have had the lights dimmed so you don t see details anymore peter pan and pirates being the worst now there were some good things fastpasses and single rider lines saved the day for us most of the broken rides were fixed in time for us to get on them except space mountain which broke again and fantasmic was awesome as usual food was great even though pricey and the staff were very helpful ,3,2013-12-01
4264,Disneyland Anaheim CA,this place would be better suited to parents with younger kids probably around the to year old age group maybe it was a case of having it too good for to long but australians were previously able to purchase a day pass for about now we get a day pass for about so we probably were not mentally ready for the happiest place on earth when you feel like you ve been had i emailed disney regarding the new fees and was told that it was due to public surveys that the prices and tickets were altered sorry disney i m not buying that but the place is very clean tidy and well run be prepared to have your photo taken at the gates so you cant give your ticket to anyone to use if you like standing in the sun for hours to get a fast pass for the cars ride so that you can come back six hours later and jump on another line with your fast pass and wait another hour for the cars ride this place is perfect ,3,2013-12-01
4265,basically you pay a lot of $ to wait in lines and eat bad food,not being a native californian maybe i just don t get it but i would rather jab bamboo under my finger nails than spend another day at disney fake manicured corporate is what i see if this is the happiest place on earth god help us my sister and i took my nephews there and what i remember is lots of waiting in line bad overpriced food and a few fun runs down the matterhorn even the boys seemed underwhelmed the older one said to me disneyland is ok but i d rather go to the tide pools at crystal cove ,2,2013-11-25
4266,"HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH ~ THEN, NOW & FOREVER!",disneyland was is and always will be the happiest place on earth there is no better vacation spot in the united states the park is definitely a family adventure and although it is getting more and more expensive it is still worth the money the best way to see disneyland and california adventure is to go for at least a week and if you want to save money stay at the best western hotel s harbor boulevard anaheim ca tel directly across the street of the main entrance if you go for a week you can buy the year long pass keep the pass as a great souvenir even though it is a bit expensive it is cheaper than buying a one day pass each day or even the three day passes i lived in southern california for many many years actually within a minute drive and i used to stay at the best western for comfort this was especially good when my children were small we would go to disneyland in the morning back to the hotel for naps swimming and lunch then back to the park in the evening for evening shows and the fireworks which are usually around pm have a great time ,5,2013-11-25
4267,Indeed the happiest place on Earth!!,if you want to feel like a child over and over again then this is the place you must go no doubt about it me and my family loved disneyland and disney california adventure we go back every twice in a year next visit again will be in days from today i can t wait ,5,2013-11-25
4268,We love Disneyland!,we came to disneyland to enjoy the christmas decorations it was wonderful although the park seemed crowded we basically walked on most of the rides our biggest waits were for star tours and the astro blasters and even those were only around minutes small world is so beautifully decorated this time of year the kids were happy and we got on all the rides we wanted to during our stay we ate lunch one day at the stage door cafe they have delicious corn dogs and fish and chips the monte cristo at blue bayou is also yummy the parade was wonderful and we loved the fireworks with the snow afterwards we watche from small world mall area i think the best view is from main street but we wanted to see the light show on the face of small world the castle was beautiful all lit up we loved our trip and will definately return the one complaint we have is that they were setting up for the view to film the next week they had a stage and lights and all sorts of equipment right in front of the castle you couldn t get a picture without some piece of equipment in the shot i thought it was very poor judgement on disney s part to block access at this time of year ,5,2013-11-22
4269,Its Disneyland!,its disneyland what is there not to love everyone should go at least once in their life park was exceptionally clean lines short prices average it is done really well ,5,2013-11-21
4270,Real Busy but good,the park and rides were fantastic and everything we expected the only problem was getting on the good rides and in fast pass lines which were real busy recommend get everything done as early as possible and resting in the afternoon and go back in the evening,4,2013-11-21
4271,Doing (gluten-free) Christmas up right!,my family and i went to disneyland two days ago two kids under two something ladies and our parents we all loved it from pirates of the caribbean to indiana jones to autopia we had a blast entry prices are high so get there early and max your time out this time of the year it gets darker faster so the mornings are the best time for water rides so you have time to dry off and little kids rides we also have some gluten intollerance in our group and at every food stall we were accommodated graciously the castle this time of year is pure magic covered in christmas lights and pipping out holiday tunes at night it snows as well and the snow smells like cinnamon orange this place is fantastic ,5,2013-11-21
4272,An amazing day for a big kid,we had a great time being big kids again we spend days on a hopper pass and we just had enough time to do what we wanted to do lines were reasonably sort not more than min wait food was good and well priced for a theme park next time we visit will be with our kids ,5,2013-11-21
4273,Excellent,this was our fourth visit to disneyland in years wow still love it we had full days during which we park hopped it was great we were there for opening and went back to the hotel for a rest and swim at lunch time then went back to the parks at night for a couple of hours my dream holiday as always the cast members were friendly the parks were clean and the shows were great mickey and the magical map was terrific all my children aged and had a wonderful time and are asking when we can go back ,5,2013-11-20
4274,Family Fun!,i wouldn t be surprised if disney paid for a lot of these positive reviews or maybe i m just some kind of grinch i don t know we only had a day for disneyland so we opted to go to disneyland park over californian adventure based on the advice of strangers on the internet maybe californian adventure is better i ll never know i should add that it was just my partner and i who are in our mid twenties no children children probably love disneyland but for us it was not that fabulous the rides were mediocre at best lines last minutes to an hour all for seconds of mild exhilaration i m looking at you space mountain i don t know why they have high speed sudden drop warnings when the rides are clearly void of these the entry fees are exorbitant and the food is crazy expensive as though disney doesn t make enough money on that note with all of the merchandise they churn out i was a little disappointed that they didn t have much in the way of the classics i m talking s classics lion king i will say that the staff are unnaturally friendly and helpful so kudos if you re after wonder and awe maybe go to universal instead that place is rad ,5,2013-11-18
4275,How to do Disneyland and California Adventure Park in one day!,yes it is possible to do both parks in one day however a few prefaces before we start i went with my partner we are aussies in our twenties so we were more interested in rides rather than shows parades we also prioritised adventure adult thrilling rides rather than classic kids rides like a lot of the fantasyland rides are we went on a tuesday before halloween so lines were fairly short opening hours were am pm big thunder mountain railroad it s a small world and tea cups were closed and there were no fireworks you won t be able to see everything it would take a few days so plan ahead and decide what s most important ok so let s start we arrived at approx am delays in getting from la don t ask and still managed to get what we wanted done but i would recommend getting there just before opening time to maximise your time we also took advantage of the single rider lines on some of the rides which meant the wait time was reduced to almost nothing it will mean you will most likely be split up but most of the time we ended up being in the same ride anyway so here s a summary of how we did it i will then follow with some more details of the rides disneyland approx indiana jones adventure single rider sr pirates of the caribbean space mountain finding nemo longest line all day matterhorn bobsleds california adventure park lunch soarin over california sr grizzly river run got fast pass for world of colour the little mermaid california screamin sr radiator springs racers sr nd longest line all day tower of terror min wait parade california screamin again sr disneyland splash mountain twice no lines indian jones again giftshops parade california adeventure park world of colour dinner at hotel indiana jones adventure we used the single rider line as wait times were already up to mins at am it s a very fun ride and worth it fast pass fp is also available for this ride pirates of the caribbean much more relaxing ride you sit in a boat and slowly drift through a world of pirates quite relaxing but very well done lines move quickly space mountain my favourite ride at disneyland thrilling rollercoaster through the darkness of space fp also available finding nemo it s very well done however if you have seen the great barrier reef in real life like me then probably don t waste your time it has very long lines longest all day but would be good if you have never seen the reef or you have kids matterhorn bobsleds ok rollercoaster nothing special though so i would wait till lines are short or do sr soarin over california simulation ride where you soar over california very good but if you are scared of heights can be a little disconcerting grizzly river run this is where you get your fp for world of colour which is at the end of the day it is fantastic the fp means you get closer viewing spots this ride is quite fun family friendly prepared to get wet though the little mermaid similar to pirates of the caribbean ride you sit in clams and float through aerial s world relaxing and awesome if you like the little mermaid there was absolutely no line for us either california screamin best ride of both parks imo thrilling fast loops also has sr which is what i did for the nd time around meant my wait time was only mins also has fp radiator springs racers really fun ride where you race another car around a race track had the longest lines of the day so we opted for sr which reduced the wait to about mins also has fp tower of terror also had a long wait about mins however it was worth the wait and you can get your picture taken while you plummet through the tower has fp parade we watched the parade as we walked back to do california screamin again had the characters from toy story little mermaid incredibles to name a few splash mountain we were going to do it earlier in the day after caribbean ride however it broke down so we skipped it until late in the day which actually paid off as there were no ques we ended up staying on it after our first ride bc no one else was waiting very fun ride but you will get wet giftshops parade at the end of the day we explored some of the giftshops and watched the parade before heading back to california park for the world of colour world of colour amazing i wont give anything away but you must do this the fp will get you closer than people without one if you want to be really close you would have to get there maybe mins early we decided to get there about mins early and still got a reasonable spot so there you have it disneyland and california park in one day told you we could do it now you may have noticed we didn t even do half the rides on offer but as i said at the start that would take days but we did do everything we wanted to do plus got to do some of the rides twice and if we got there at opening time we probably could have done one or two more a word on the fast passes we ended up not using them except for world of colour because we were lucky and the lines were generally very short but if you go during peak times weekends holidays etc then it would be advised to use them as it will save you lots of time if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave a message and i ll try and answer i hope you have found this helpful ,5,2013-11-17
4276,Nobody does it better....,first time at disneyland after visiting disneyworld several times for me the biggest difference between the two can be summed up in one word humidity anaheim in november had some of the best weather i ever experienced and it allows you to more fully enjoy all that disney has to offer disneyland is basically the magic kingdom so it particularly appeals to children travelling with an year old we discovered that seeing princesses and characters no longer holds the same appeal as it did when she was four for tweens and teens california adventure has more magic than disneyworld crowds here can be somewhat overwhelming cause the park is really not all that large all your favorites from childhood are here from the tiki s to poo and it is still wonderful to watch a child s face light up while getting an autograph from mary poppins or minnie mouse the parks are clean you feel safe the mood is always festive the staff exceedingly helpful and despite the ever increasing price of park admission you never feel cheated on a disney vacation that being said there are some area s where it is more prudent to explore other options take the restaurants fast food and snacks are pretty much the same in every theme park or ballpark over priced but good enough to satisfy and allow more time to explore and enjoy as for sit down formal dining disneyland is not the place to be with all of anaheim only minutes away you should take advantage of those restaurants for sure for example blue bayou restaurant in disneyland is located right along side the pirates of the caribbean ride and your table can actually overlook the ride itself cute and entertaining but do you really want to pay per entree without apps drink salad or dessert to sit next to a parade of boats with tourists in day glo shorts singing yo ho yo ho the pirates life for me for me the only other disappointment was sleeping beauty s castle it seems very small and insignificant compared to cinderella s castle in orlando which is the focal point of the park while there the christmas decorations were put up and while beautiful to me degrees and jingle bells don t seem to mesh the fireworks are great and the water fountain displays are great as well though hard to see with the way the crowd gathers around you with children on shoulders and so on again a disneyland vacation is unique unto itself your mindset is different here than anywhere else you would go it is not a relaxing time but especially if you have children with you it can be the best time you ever have on a vacation try and withstand the crowding endless walking and cost and you will find yourself truly entertained the people at disney truly have perfected their craft and whether on the east or west coast you won t be disappointed ,5,2013-11-15
4277,Wow!!!,was my first time at any disney property and i was truly blown away all the rides and sights are absolutely amazing the park was done up for christmas and was truly magical the crowds were large on the weekend but not overwhelming the staff at disney are like a well trained army very efficient but always polite and always friendly can t wait to go back,5,2013-11-14
4278,Everyone should visit,the st and most historical park of all some technological rides would help to keep alive this nice park my son loved everyone should have the oportunity to shake hands with all disney crew ,5,2013-11-12
4279,Ripoff,at each we expected it to be less crowded but was a zoo like on a weekend night they need to have a better system of clearing out guests who did not pay ever fee fireworks were cancelled because of wind will never attend again for trick or treat and we are disneyland lovers,2,2013-10-28
4280,Terrible Day at what they proclaim to be the Happiest Place on Earth !!,on wednesday oct th we entered the disney park at the am opening and proceded left to right beginning at adventureland the day started fine with the tiki house and jungle river cruise and crowd level was typical for oct mid week and a great weather day from here it was all a very frustrating and disappointing experience i should add that i have visited this attraction twice before and have done the far superior disney world florida theme parks multiple times the sign on entry showed that its a small world and thunder mountain rides were down but several more were also discovered to be unavailable for various reasons throughout the day including indian jones disney railroad splash mountain casey jones railroad monorail some of these attractions suggested we check back later for availabilty which we did several times in spite of being dog tired from retracing our path they continued to be unavailable each time i voiced my concerns to consumer relations management cavan at the site at pm and was even more disappointed and frustrated at their response this was a plus day including entry fee parking and food and yet attractions were unavailable and i expected some compensation for such a reduced attraction availability in spite of us explaining we had only that day in the area and that we had already been in the park for hours the customer service manager suggested he could grant fast pass to of the closed attractions which according to signage in the park were still closed and he wasn t even aware of the status he then offered passes to adventureland for another day even though he was told we were there from canada for that day only there were other comments about protecting the safety of attendees and i suggested that was an incredibly high number of issues that proper preventive maintenance should minimize or eliminate they have from pm to am to perform this the grounds staff are generally polite however the attendant at the monorail waited for park goers to climb the ramp to tell them you people came at the wrong time the ride is now off service for minutes in a smug and uncaring tone as opposed to going to the bottom of the ramp to advise people and prevent yet another long walk and wait i think a discount to our entry fee a park gift card for shops or dining could have been offered if they were truly a customer focussed business but instead we were left very disappointed frustrated and would never recommend this facility another issue that was obvious was location of washrooms are a well kept secret due to absence of signage and only info was on the site map that is confusing and poorly scaled in total we believe that the self proclaimed happiest place on earth is their opinion and that they are complacent about true service level we do not recommend this park in spite of the disney brand power ,2,2013-10-28
4281,OVERRATED OVER PRICED,we have been going to disneyland for years however this last trip really irritated me for the price you pay to get into this park you should not have to wait for hours on end to ride just one ride it s unfair that they allow so many local year round passes in to clog up the park when out of town visitors pay exorbitant amounts of money to get in for one or two days and spend all of our time standing in line the service has went downhill as well cast members aka disneyland employees are not very cheerful or polite anymore last time ever disneyland ,2,2013-10-27
4282,"Magic, just pure magic . . . ;-)",there are no words that can express just how wonderful this place is we travelled from england this was our rd visit we know that the prices are high but small cost for such happiness the only downside was that on our second day visit there were no fireworks we were gutted so gutted all this way no fireworks but we had a wonderful time will return to the true home of disney x x,5,2013-10-23
4283,Too many people and rides not in good condition,we spent two days at disney in october oct and oct was friday we had gone to california adventure first and the first second and third ride we attempted to go on were broken radiator springs racers were broken at park opening and we weren t even allowed to go close were told to try again in hours then tried california screamin broke just as we got in line then went to grizzly river rapids closed too waited min for soaring over california and went to disneyland rode star tours a couple of times and then went to indiana jones min line we were in the underground portion of the line and it stopped moving lights came on broken we were stuck in there for about min before they got it working again we got kicked out of disneyland at pm so that they could have the halloween party there for this trip we paid each for day park hopper tickets so this day cost us i figure it was about per ride and we got to wait min for the privilege i think they let too many people in the park and for a tourist paying top dollar it is just not worth it this was supposed to be a non busy time too i do not plan on a return visit anytime in the future ,2,2013-10-21
4284,A little disappointed,i was really looking forward to the disneyland trip but i was disappointed the park is small it s way too busy line ups approx mins for a minute ride the princess castle was small i thought it would be bigger after watching various adverts on tv i had a day park pass and i am glad i did not buy a day pass because in days of visiting one park disneyland i was really bored i will not attend it again in the future it was also too hot outside c in october and when you stand in lines for half an hour or minutes without any shading you really lose interest in the rides i am not sure if my experience would be different if i attended in the winter i cannot imagine people attending the park in the summer when it is in season i was told that october was off season but still it was too hot and too busy i also think for what it is the park is too expensive ,2,2013-10-20
4285,We love Disneyland!! The magic is still there.,another generation of our family was introduced to disneyland during this trip i was first there in took my children in grown kids and grand kids in and this trip celebrated our year old granddaughters birthday and we came down from alaska to share a disney birthday with her seeing her absolute delight was a joy for us as well the parks were full but for the rides a year old could do not horrible she absolutely loved everything we did there my husband is now in a mobility cart and he was very surprised at how accessible the park is the park is fairly expensive but the amount of cast members fabulous state of the facilities and cleanliness and safety makes it well worth the price the attention to detail is still amazing the food choices have improved greatly through the years there are plenty of places to people watch and we all agreed we should have planned double the time next time ,5,2013-10-20
4286,First class entertainment for the whole family.,first class entertainment for the whole family the day park hopper pass was great value there s more than enough to keep you at it for days on end september meant that the queues weren t that long and rides were accessible fast passes are definitely a great idea ,5,2013-10-17
4287,Unhappiest Place,what was supposed to be a magical th birthday trip to the magic kingdom for our grandson was the most unhappiest trip of all while we expected to find lines at rides we didn t expect to have to wait hours for a ride that lasted less that ten minutes we spent hard earned money to take our youngest grandson on a trip that we wanted to be special for a grandson who has already overcome health obstacles in his young life this was a trip i would not recommend to anyone the so called fast pass system is only fast in the short times that they are available finding the location is like looking for a needle in a haystack do not eat the food found at the park not only is it expensive it is terrible disney has always been known for their excellent service this was not true during this visit the disney photographers did not even give us a chance to take pictures of the places we wanted to take we were moved out of the way rudely the final straw came when the pirates of the caribbean broke down we were stuck for over minutes do not visit during any holiday weekend the overcrowding is unbelievable ,2,2013-10-14
4288,Everything & more than I'd thought it would be!,tip cars land ride is the most popular attraction when you use your magic morning pass make it your first stop if you haven t got pass head straight to the fast pass machine located in front of bugs land entrance get a fast pass we got a fast pass am had to wait till pm skipped the queue that had a minute wait wow just wow i recently took my yo son between us we had the time of our lives firstly you will need a good days to see both parks disneyland disney adventure we spent hrs on our first day that was only half of disneyland comfortable shoes are an obvious must we went at the end of sept which makes it autumn there omigodness it was hot shorts n tees entire time rides disneyland my son was able to go on all of them which was great our favourite was matterhorn bobsleds least favourite autotopia we waited almost an hour n it was average adventure park rides our favourite had to be california screamin rollercoaster we did it times we spent the third day relaxing enjoying the incredible shows entertainment the parade was brilliant so much effort goes into the whole park props rides costumes and the bugs life d show world of colour firework shows are a must the world of colour disney adventure park was like nothing i ve ever seen it brought tears to my eyes took me back to being a kid it s that beautiful i take my hat off to the staff i didn t meet one rude staff member very friendly helpful food was delicious stand out restaurant had to be ariels grotto french market resturant new orleans square another like i said everything more most memorable happiest holiday we ve ever had ,5,2013-10-14
4289,Not Walt Disneys Dream anymore.,ive gotten the season pass every year and every year it gets more expensive food is average and overpriced parking is annual passes are exsagerated overpriced they offer no real discounts for tickets or annual passes when every year they go up ive get the no block out date pass and see so many familys get denied admission because its a black out day that day and you still have to pay for admission to special event like mickeys halloween party seriously and get ready for over crowde line its just feels like it all about money there now i really dont think if waltvdisney was alive it would be so corporate this year i bought my family the los angeles zoo annual pass knotts berry farm passe for kid adults and universal studios annual passes by a day get a year kid adults guess what its still less than deluxe pass at disneyland for ,3,2013-10-12
4290,Really is the happiest place :),i went to disneyland as a kid about years californian adventureecided it was time to go again since i love disney we went on a wednesday and the day predicted rain but it did not matter lining up for the rides was a show in itself with lots of detail every live performance had live singing and i would absolutely recommend seeing the aladdin show more like a full musical complete with flying carpet giant puppet elephant and snake and the world of colour fountain show amazing get there early to see it or reserve a section otherwise it can be hard to find a spot if you are going to pick one park pick the california adventure as it has the good shows andvstayed open later but there are things about disneyland that i loved like space mountain star tours haunted house pirates of the caribbean and the indiana jones rides so it really is value to get the park hopper plus there are a lot of live street performers which is great if you have a smartphone there is an app called mousewait that tells you how long the wait times for the rides are so you can decide since it was a rainy wednesday we had about mins max for rides the park in general is full of experiences but different to other adrenaline filled parks eg six flags as the rides are not wild at all we all had an awesome time and made wonderful memories ,5,2013-10-12
4291,DisneyLand vs. DisneyWorld,ive been going to disney world every year since i was born years and finally went to disneyland for the first time last week one thing s for sure is that you cannot have a bad time at a disney park we went first week of october and there were absolutely no lines which was great mickey minnie were all around the park in their halloween costumes although it was difficult to find other characters except for jack skellington at the haunted mansion the parade at the end of the night was also a lot of fun and not overly crowded positives great for all ages mickey bars are delicious fast passes are genius although we didn t need them splash mountain pirates of the caribbean indiana jones space mountain are worth the wait great shops and disney merchandise locker storage at entrance of park disney staff taking pictures with your camera negatives food expensive and not the greatest tasting along with looong lines matterhorn ride was painful don t ride it also the thunder mountain ride was under repair which was a letdown very expensive one day ticket but worth it if you haven t been disneyland wasn t as big or exciting as disneyworld s magic kingdom atmosphere was a lot different even though it had the same rides and attractions if you re a diehard disney fan or want to go all out on a disney trip i suggest you go to disneyworld in orlando as it has several different parks and waterparks overall disneyland in california was a memorable experience for us adults and i bet the little ones had fun too ,4,2013-10-06
4292,Went 9/27,as a season pass holder i go to disneyland several times a year this last friday was for mickey s halloween party this is a special ticket buy that allows the person to trick or treat at the park upside is that the villains are out and can get a lot of great pictures a nice place to take kids who might be easily scared with some costumes you find at street parties they have a strict costume policy so no worries about seeing people wearing inappropriate gear downside is that most restaurants are closed if you have children who do not do well with loud noises there are the fireworks and a thunder rumbling machine to help with the ambiance the lines for attractions were not that long and ticket holders were given two extra hours to come in before the true festivities i loved the monster u dance party the kids with us had a grand time it is something that should be experienced at least once of course the haunted mansion is transformed into nightmare before christmas and before some parents worry the park as both candy and healthy alternatives for the youngins have a spooky good time ,5,2013-10-06
4293,"Disney's ""Extra"" Magic Means Disappearing Values",we were a bit disappointed by our disneyland experience because the cutting of so many corners seems to have been a bit too obvious this trip we visited between and four day park hopper tickets here is my list of grips with disney that i wish they d work on for future visitors got a call from guest services two days before my long drive down the coast to tell me that i should have been able to purchase convention tickets after all although their website clearly stated those were not valid until the gentleman also told me that the rd party tickets i purchased from ares travel would not be redeemable at the hotel check in desk he was incorrect on both counts and his phone calls was clearly a sales pitch full of ignorance or deception i was not impressed i made several calls to disney to find out why the i spent on tickets was now being called fraud and they wouldn t guarantee to redeem the ticket vouchers you can imagine the stress this caused when every person claimed to not know and not be able to help me ares assured me it would be fine and it was disney is not friendly to guests who use a travel agent to purchase tickets shameful staff at disneyland hotel were not at all friendly their helpfulness seemed forced they seemed burned out they forced us to use their bell hop service and would not allow us to park and load our own luggage they took our car keys from us in case of an emergency while in the loading zone on our departure rude the pool staff and steakhouse staff and experiences however were amazing i can t explain the inconsistency if the front desk and valet staff and housekeeping get their act together then i would go back but not the way it is now early magic hour was the most horrible thing ever the lines were longer than the normal opening lines the entry in the grand californian had a hour wait time to get in so the resort guests have to use the regular line anyway their tech is not warmed up so the lines move slowly and their iphones are not working they want to re photograph you every morning then when you get in only two lands are open and all the best rides in each of those are down due to an emergency aka there are barely any cast members in the park and most of those are there to turn you away it is a ghost town during the extra magic which is a total waste of time so nobody got to ride racers in carsland that day and the main rides in tomorrowland star tours were down for the entire extra magic hour none of the restaurants the river belle terrace for breakfast opened until after so our plans were all completely delayed or ruined each and every day due to budget constraints and emergencies to top it off a giant i mean giant spider was dangling from the monorail structure in tomorrow land and hit a man in the face it was horrible i know from staff at disneyworld fl that they fog their park regularly disney was full of ferrel cats and the worst spider i ve ever seen the web hung down over feet staff who saw the problem pretended not to notice with a four day park hopper we still didn t get to do all the rides we had hoped to because the extra magic hour was a complete non starter a real dead duck they actually had staff installed at all the randomly closed my favorite frontierland and adventureland doors to turn us away due to budget constraints i would have been fine with it if they hadn t posted on their site that only mickey s toontown would be unavailable no it was literally almost the entire park no food opened until after general opening and all the main rides were down in the areas that were open what is the point i don t know why more people are not complaining from a management standpoint they are just barely staffing the park until opening at am to save money period every ride in each open land could not have possibly been down for the entire extra magic hour it was insulting our intelligence they just won t deliver the goods shameful other than that the halloween overlays on the haunted mansion and space mountain were a huge hit the shorter hours during the week and the lack of fireworks at night coupled with the extra magic being worthless means that october is not the best time to visit after all the weather was nice but without the ability to have the time to do the rides we came to do it was frustrating i felt totally scammed by the extra magic hour reviewers who claim it helped them rides racers and other such high demand rides led me believe disney was up and running on time which they were not for three days running so i am pretty sure they are not consistent about that don t expect much from disney finally my biggest frustration is that all their food establishments close at when the park closes at so you are forced to eat in downtown disney and even that was closed our first night when we left the park same with our hotel restaurants with exception of steakhouse which was great why don t they leave the food establishments open longer at least until closing i don t like leaving the parks tired and hungry disney has long since held such high standards that i really think if they don t intend to really be open yet they should not advertise the extra magic hour as such either be open or not ,4,2013-10-05
4294,Aussies Had Fun at Disneyland,we bought a day hopper pass and after our long flight from australia we checked into hotel to have a few hours sleep and then went over to disneyland about p m the line ups were so small at this time of day that the waiting time was minutes maximum even on the popular rides we stayed on to watch the mickey parade that night which was great the next day we went to california adventure park and immediately got our fast pass to world of color that night the line up to get on cars spring racer ride was minutes but if you are prepared to go in the single rider lane the maximum line up time for us was minutes this means that you still get to line up with your friend family but you go in a separate car for the actual ride which was fine with us we happened to ask could they place us so that we would end up racing each other and the friendly employee happily did this for us which made it even more fun we were able to go on this attraction many times this way once we knew single rider lines existed on most attractions we used this option at both theme parks and it was a great time saver on all the popular attractions on the matterhorn bobsled the line up was enormous but we went single rider and went straight on the ride within one minute the staff at both theme parks were extremely friendly and helpful if we had to ask for directions i would not recommend going to theme parks in peak periods as the line ups would be horrendous and you wouldn t get your money s worth or enjoy the experience take your poncho to go on grizzly river run and splash mountain if you don t want all your belongings to get soaked we had so much fun and had lots of laughs and some screams on all of the different rides make sure you go on all of the kids rides too as the animation and technology involved in each of those rides is just amazing and beautiful it really is the happiest place on earth ,4,2013-09-27
4295,Great for Families with Younger Kids,i won t get long winded as you can read thousands of reviews on disneyland here but wanted to mention a quick comparison in case you are debating between visiting here or orlando we had a great time at both locations but my suggestion would be for families with children or older to consider the larger complex in florida and for families with younger children to consider california this location was so much more convenient for getting back to your room for lunch nap or a quick swim many hotels are literally across the street and the entrances are very manageable florida is far more elaborate and at least double the size if not triple but you are constantly waiting for a bus or paying hundreds of dollars in concession stand food older kids can manage the larger parks on shear adrenaline but younger kids will experience the same magic at disneyland california without the negatives that come with orlando we spent ten days in orlando and still didn t see everything we spent days at disneyland in ca and that was just right to see and enjoy the characters you can t go wrong with either location ,4,2013-09-21
4296,Easy two days worth. Fun for any age.,this attraction is worth the price and if you re in the area you can t skip it tons of walking wear good shoes and go on as many rides as possible do both parks and in the end your bucks is worth it don t skip indiana jones space mountain the cars ride or splash mountain ,4,2013-09-20
4297,Disney 1st Timer!,i really enjoyed by time at disney and the california adventures we went for my son s th birthday and he absolutely had a blast we went on every ride and did almost every attraction which is quite possible in days but we had tickets for days so we repeated our favourite things on day the tower of terror is great as is the indiana jones splash mountain grizzly river run mattahorn and california screamin space mountain thunder railroad and the haunted mansion were closed for renos we were lucky with the line ups we waited a maximum of mins for the big rides and for most we didn t even bother getting fast passes as the wait time was not too long the fireworks are lovely but the most impressive show is the world of colour omg this is beautiful get fast passes for this or else you will not get a good view our son did moan about having to stand around for an hour prior to the show but it is worth it overall an excellent trip ,4,2013-09-13
4298,Things change.,the last time we went to disneyland was probably about years ago over the years we have been many times one tends to get jaded after a while and i am not one who gushes over this place we go because it is a place all children must go to at least a few times we have our must do rides which long ago ceased to be novel so this review is not for those who have never been or those who are disney fanatics one thinks about the crowds and the lines and is it worth the price which is now a not inconsequential a day here are the changes we noticed for the first time we were not parked at the park itself but actually at a lot several blocks away i missed the open air trolley cars with the greeter narrator we rode in a bus we bought our tickets online no need to wait in a ticket line they scanned us in and gave us a little card for a summer day during the week it was not that crowded but we still rushed to space mountain our favorite ride fast passes work a little different now they are only good for a specific time slot in the future in the past they would be accepted even after the designated hour the star tours attraction has been changed to a new video since we last went i thought that this was my favorite ride little improvements have been added to many of the rides to update them the attraction called innovations where the carousel of progress used to be was an interesting use of a large space i wondered how long it would last it seems to me although i can t confirm that the restaurants have more varied menus than before although prices are not for the faint of heart but definitely more interesting menu choices than before we did not try any of it in the end it s an institution and lots of people have a lot of fun but one has to be realistic it s a very large undertaking and there are many people there,4,2013-09-03
4299,Just as good as last year!,second year in a row we were fortunate enough to go to disneyland we used a day park hopper passes considering it was prime time we never waited more than minutes for any attraction even when you do wait there is always something to look at while in the line ups gravestones at the haunted mansion for example that s the type of thing that sets disney apart from any other amusement park the small details are as good as the big rides fireworks and fantasmic are truly amazing our day pass was just right for our family of to take our time each day back to the hotel for lunch and a swim in the middle of the day can t wait to visit again ,5,2013-08-29
4300,Love Disneyland!,i visit more than once per year really enjoy the time with family a must go especially with small children can t wait to come back ,5,2013-08-27
4301,Disneyland California Adventure Water Display,disneyland is always a great place to go and take kids of all ages i have been attending disneyland since you could use books of green stamps for entry and have seen so many of the shows and displays that i thought i couldn t be impressed last week after going through the park s attractions and rides all day with my daughter her brother in law and two young grandsons i decided to stay and watch the water display on the california adventure side even though i was fairly exhausted i was so impressed that i want to go another time just to see it again it was scheduled twice that evening a friday after dark and i would research the summer show times versus the after labor day times if you decide to go the colors water ballets music and disney themed pictures were more than spectacular many older and more current disney movies and characters were represented in awesome d via the waterworks it makes the water show in front of the bellagio in las vegas look like a splash in the bathtub caution get your seats or spaces early i e at least an hour as the late comers standing in the back will miss some parts of the lower down display this is the only reason i didn t give the display a of ,4,2013-08-25
4302,"Not quite Florida, but still pretty good.",nice compact version of the florida park it has many of the major rides but compressed into a much smaller area monorail only stops in futureland and downtown disney even though it circles around most of the park space mountians computer crashed times during our first day there once just as we reached the front of an hour long lineup but when it was finally up and running a staff member gave us a front of the line pass to make up for it we covered everything we wanted to see in days at both disneyland and california adventure compared to weeks at the contempory in florida and still missing whole sections of the park it s that compact lineups are generally long hour plus for many but some rides do have fastpass outlets if you don t mind coming back later at a preset time the light fireworks show is very crowded for the early show and only a few good spots to see all the action but they have a second show hrs later that is suppose to be much more accessable if you don t want deluxe disney accomedation during your stay the monorails don t stop there anyway the ramada maingate and best western are located literally across the street from the main gate and much cheaper overall a definite must see if you re in the area with the usual efficiant but friendly service of disney got a three day park hopper pass from costco that included seaworld and universal studios for less then a straight day pass at the front gate ,4,2013-08-24
4303,Old School Disney,been to magic kingdom and other disney world parks enjoyed disneyland more cozier less crowded even in mid july everyone is scarily friendly and helpful similar attractions as magic kingdom easier access to characters for kids lines to get autographs much shorter than at disneyworld ,5,2013-08-24
4304,Turning in his grave,i visit california to stay with family every months and usually visit with around a dozen of our us family for a day out we spent christmas there and were very disappointed that some of the rides were out of action the fireworks were cancelled and that the crowds were so big i had trouble getting into some of the other rides my father in law is in a wheelchair and on some of the rides we were allowed to the front so he could get on the ride only to be sworn at by some people standing in line this in front of the disney staff who did nothing also we were shouted at by disney staff when trying to get through a crowd with the wheelchair for going the wrong way i e mailed on my return to uk and was offered free entry for my family when i visited again i tried to speak to disney this year during my visit and they did not want to honour their previous offer thanks disney poor old walt must be sinning in his grave at the way the company has gone high prices for a day pass old tired rides and attractions no discount for california residents who keep the park going rude unhelpful staff extortionate food prices save yourself the money and trouble and give it a miss ,1,2013-08-24
4305,Another great visit,we had another great visit to disneyland we did find the parks more crowded than usual than the previous visits at the same time in previous years since we been to disneyland times in the past we knew the layout and how to use the fast pass system so our wait times were minimal we got to ride our favorite rides sometimes several times we still had a great time in spite of the crowds one negative we did find was the three park days we had were all grad nights we encountered many of the grads and their rude behavior pushing kids and adults using profanity fighting etc we saw two little kids get seriously hurt being knocked over by these grads they also line jumped and dared anyone to report them when someone did the cast member either shrugged her shoulders or one said they are out of hand and we have no control over them disney should rethink the grad night it also seemed that they allowed too many grads in the parks each night otherwise it was a great visit during the day we will rethink our visits and most likely change the time we visit next time ,4,2013-08-22
4306,So you can't do two parks in a day,i went by myself and thought i could tackle both parks in a day wrong i had to leave some stuff off my list however the stuff i did get to was great the fact that it was summer and i probably also had the same idea as the disney expo attendees to check out the area likely factored in ,4,2013-08-21
4307,Losing its magic.,family vacation with year and month old stayed at a disney hotel so took advantage of morning magic hour even so the line ups are outrageous at times radiator springs racer if you don t get on it first thing expect an hour or more line up fast passes are gone within first hour of park opening this ride breaks down a lot in fact many rides broke down dumbo matterhorn bobsled star tours to name a few ridiculous we tried to get on dumbo first thing one morning it s slow loading and no fast passes one of the dumbos break so the attendant empties the line and says the ride is closed while she covers the broken dumbo then she re opens the ride meanwhile we lost our spot and have to line up again makes no sense hand stamps we got hand stamps every day but every time we re entered they never used them and insisted on us showing our tickets after three days of this i decided that the hand stamps were useless but of course the attendant now wants to see it she says that we won t get in without a handstamp if the park was at capacity but the park wasn t at capacity so what the night shows unlike disneyworld there is no seating and for world of color you ll need a fast pass people arrive early and stake out a spot for viewing but you can forget about sitting in the spot you got because just before the show they ask everyone to stand and squeeze as many people as possible into the area it is what it is you ll still have fun or at least your kids will but i suggest going off season if you can if not go to disneyworld if you have to go during busy season use the fast passes as much as possible ,4,2013-08-20
4308,It really is so magical!,my husband and i took our boys and years old to disneyland and california adventure this summer for our vacation the last time we went was just the two of us and i have to say either way it is such a magical place yes it s expensive for everything from entry tickets to memorabilia to food but you know what it s worth it the experience we had and the memories we made with our boys will stay with us and them forever they are already talking about the next time we go i have to say the people at the parks really do know how to make the experience magical we had the best service from every employee we encountered they were friendly helpful and always smiling they were also very generous not something we expected at all after paying for digital downloads on ride photos the rd ride gave us the photo for free plus when we were at star traders making one son his lightsaber the store clerk insisted on making one for our other son for free he thought it was only fair that they both had one even when we told him our other son had picked out what he wanted earlier that day at another store plus our first day there the lady in the store was talking to us about our trip and gave our boys their st visit badges which they wore proudly every day i know people get all sorts of badges like this for free but it was the fact that she took the initiative to offer them we never had to ask all in all it was worth every penny and it left us with the sparkling magic feeling that disneyland should ,5,2013-08-18
4309,It's a small world.,although the attention to detail was amazing my after thoughts of the park were stuck on the congestion and long ride lines radiator springs was amazing my son is a big cars fan and loved the characters driving around if you go get to radiator springs early and get tbe fast pass for the race even though the park does not compare to disney world we had a good time by the way if disney chpped down their prices on souvenirs wouldn t they sell more fast quarters are always better than slow dollars ,4,2013-08-16
4310,Magical! I will be forever young due to Disney:)!,a thousand thank yous to the reviewer a few ahead of this one titled there s nothing like disneyland still my family favorite you said everything that i was going to say brilliantly a must read for anyone wanting tips on tackling disneyland a truly wonderful magical place i and my two teenagers have travelled there from canada three of the last five summers including july i just can t stay away i have always got the day pass for the price of deal which is becoming much more difficult to find the last times we got them through travel best bets i paid can this year slightly more expensive than the day pass as for the two parks i have a few tips to add to the previous review a great time to do california screaming awesome ride without a fast pass seemed to be in the pm time frame i m guessing it s because it s way at the back of california adventure and many people could be in disneyland due to the almost back to back parades at h and pm and then they stay there to be in the park for the fireworks and fantasmic just remember to pick up a fast pass for soaring over california or tower of terror before you head over so you can do them on the way back also the ariel ride takes minute to get on at that time of night if you plan on being like many and heading into disneyland during the dinner and after dinner hours and are wiiling to stay until almost closing older kids our routine to avoid long lines and too much walking was to a get a fast pass for space mountain or star tours at that time of the day the fast passes are backed up so your return time will not be until much later pm which actually worked to our advantage b go on the matterhorn it s a small world and other fantasyland or tomorow land rides depending on their wait times they are always way better during parade times take advantage of this c by this time you will be able to get another fast pass for space mountain or star tours again for later in the evening d head over to adventure land to indiana jones and go single rider we did this several times and bypassed a hundred people you can also do the jungle cruise and by pm pirates of the caribean wait times are only minutes e by pm when fantasmic starts you can literally walk onto pirates and the haunted house doing them a few times if you want f watch the fireworks at pm from outside the haunted house it s not the best view but it s pretty good go down to the walkway along the rivers of america and you can see tinkerbell and dumbo in the distance g we would rest our weary bodies at this point on the ledge made seat along the river and wait for the fantasmic show it is incredible or you can go on haunted again or splash mountain quickly and then come back not much of a line at this time h go use your fast passes acquired earlier back in tomorrow land single rider is the way especially for the grizzly run california screaming and indiana jones you go up the exit path and get a single rider ticket at california screaming it s up to the left of the line through an inconspicuous gate soaring over california is a crap shoot going single rider either works great or backfires so use fast passes if you can what an amazing ride do not miss this one an even better place to watch the fireworks is in fantasyland beside the dumbo ride there are cement seats around the flowers i enjoy this vantage point because you are between the fireworks and tinkerbell and dumbo s flight over the castle you don t have to find a seat an hour earlier like everyone watching in front of on the other side of the castle and thus waste precious time it is way less crowded and you are right close to the peter pan ride to jump on it as soon as the fireworks end note fantasyland shuts down at pm but not it s a small world if you have young children and want to leave the park in the half hour after the fireworks take the railroad in fantasyland to get out avoiding the wall to wall people walk down main street it s fun and you can sit down the fast pass systems between disneyland and california adventure are not connected so you can have two fast passes on the go if you are park hopping within the same park you can t get a second fast pass until you wait the designated time shown on the current fast pass usually ranging from minutes to as long as hours later in the day finally good luck on your disney adventure you will love it i know i can t wait to go back ,5,2013-08-14
4311,Not nearly as good as Disneyworld,i was disappointed during my recent visit to disneyland this is all disney s fault after all they are the ones who set my expectations so high in the first place disneyworld is amazing disneyland has decent rides and absolutely terrible customer service first the parks if you have been to disneyworld then disneyland will feel like a letdown in comparison it is in the middle of a city so you don t get the same experience of being transported to another world as you do with disneyworld everything is smaller especially the castle it also feels much more crowded than disneyworld california adventure is neat and has some things you cannot find at disneyworld the staff at disneyland is not nearly as courteous or polite as the staff at disneyworld there were two particularly glaring examples of this i was travelling with my disabled daughter and there were several rides at disneyland where no attempt was made to provide a reasonable accomodation per ada guidelines in all cases there was nothing about the ride itself or the line structure etc that prevented disney from making an accomodation in our case they simply chose not to do so this is not the case at disneyworld disneyland also does not advertise the fact that they fail to comply with ada requirements so guests with disabilities who are used to having reasonable accomodations at other parks get no warning that a good percentage of the rides will be unavailable to them until after they have paid their non refundable money for tickets the ride operators were not polite about the failure to provide accomodations one man literally screamed at a woman in line in front of me and told her that she should go somewhere else if she didn t like how they had set things up she and her daughter walked away in tears as a result other operators were repeatedly confused and provided conflicting information on where to go when using a guest assistance pass etc we stayed to watch the fireworks one night there were repeated warnings that the park lights would be turned off and we should not move during the fireworks show so my family and i picked out a spot along the railing to the side of a walkway five minutes after the show started a disney employee started shining her flashlight in my face and loudly told us that we needed to go somewhere else because we were blocking the walkway keep in mind that the walkway was about feet wide at this point and we were taking up at most feet of this as we stood touching the side railing i politely told the employee that i did not feel safe trying to move with my small children in the darkness she responded by threatening to call security and have me kicked out of the park during this exchange my oldest daughter got confused and started to follow the disney employees instructions by walking off into the dark night into a crowd of people it took us minutes to find her and the disney employee refused to let me use her flashlight or provide any other help in locating the child that she had caused to get lost these experiences unfortunately marred what should have been a very enjoyable experience at disneyland ,2,2013-08-12
4312,Sadly Lacking,i took my family to disneyland resorts in california and sadly it was lacking in most categories specifically the majority of the employees mostly on the california adventure side were terrible they lacked any semblance of manners and were condescending when asked for information especially if you had any sort of a disability however there were a few employees who seemed to enjoy their jobs and went beyond what a normal person would expect to assist you or just to ask how things were going on one particular incident my daughter was busy vomiting up in public her clam chowder bread bowl she had just finished eating from the bakery in california adventure land the employees and the lead cook of the bakery were totally uncaring and condescending when out of nowhere one of the busboys stopped and assisted us he seemed genuinely concerned about her welfare kept repeatedly asking if we wanted him to get someone other then the employees of the eatery to help us asked if he could get her some water medical assistance etc go figure the lowest of the lowest paid is going out of his way to accomplish the goals and vision of walt disney where the supervisors and the managers were failing miserably on the bright side most of the rides were in working order and they were clean the employees working on the rides on the disney side were very helpful and cheerful however on the california adventure side it was totally opposite of the ride operators were either rude or uncaring and virtually all were unfriendly however again there were a few employees who stood out with their friendliness mostly because they took the time to approach us and ask us if we needed help or just to start a conversation with us overall i would would recommend the disney side to others however the california adventure side failed miserably i would not recommend it to anyone especially if you have any sort of disability ,1,2013-08-11
4313,Love Disney,show up when the park opens the park is least crowded from am and again late at night the corn dogs are the best but not easy to find ,5,2013-08-10
4314,Getting to old?,it was an ok experience i have been to disney world some years ago with my kids and disney land seemed old and tired could have been that i did not have young kids with me not sure but wasn t impressed and wasn t worth the money ,3,2013-08-10
4315,Great time at Disneyland,the parks are very close to each other and downtown disney huge difference from walt disney world where you have to take a bus monorail to the park although crowded it can be done in one day doing both parks in one day i feel would be to much we had breakfast at the plaza inn the food was mediocre but there were many characters we saw minnie pluto eeyore tiger pooh perla mouse from cinderella fairy godmother captain hook i may be missing one i found this park easier to navigate as well ,5,2013-08-07
4316,The kid in me !,disneyland ah i do not believe i have to write a review for this since others say all what the heck my first visited when i was in the late teen and now i am back with the whole family and our colleges boys in this park i am a kid again our accommodation within walking distance to the park which gave us the luxury to go into park early stay up late and escaping the heat in the afternoon with days hopper you can hop from disney to cali adventure back and forward we all went up to almost all the rides snow mountain the roller coaster and the tower of terror are not for me but to my boys these were the thrill of a life time from radiator springs racers to the little mermaid in dl and indiana jones to peter pan in cali adv we covered all you should never miss the aladdin show at day time the world of color at paradise pier get fast track for blue line center of the show you can see all and fantasmica sp at the river no fast track first come first server line up and so much much more to see to do even a simple train ride gave you a surprise the cost for this amazing place to my opinion was under charge you have to remember as long as you cross the gate all include in your ticket not foods nor drinks but you can go to any food stand as along they have cup to get a cup of ice at no charge to me this is not just the shows the rides the technology years ago still work like charm for today every decoration into details which amazed me so much for mr disney vision under the hot july sun all staffs in this park from the young person to senior still maintaining such pleasant friendly face they really provide the happy place on earth how do they train their staff wow i love to come back one day may be with my grand kids tips ho and sandwiches small snack s is allowed in the parks ,5,2013-08-04
4317,Do not believe the hype,our recent day at disneyland anaheim was our maiden visit to the happiest place on earth yet our experience did not live up to the hype the park is extremely crowded and most attractions are of average standard compared with other theme parks,3,2013-08-03
4318,"This is the ultimate experience, but you have to have a strategy!",disney is disney expect it to be crowded expect it to be expensive expect it to be crazy then go in with a strategy i use the book the unofficial guide to disneyland and it is the best guidebook ever there are also editions for the florida parks we follow this book religiously and we also download and use the lines app that coordinates with the book our experience was great we rode everything we wanted to we made excellent use of the fastpasses and everyone had a great time i also enjoyed the weather that was much less humid than in florida the park was packed with people but we still managed to pull off a great day if you re going to successfully do disney don t expect to show up without a plan and have a good time buy the guidebook and use it like it s the bible you will have a super experience i have done this now for four disney vacations all successfully ,5,2013-07-28
4319,Eighth time visit and likely last time for a long time,i attend a conference every other year in long beach and bring the family to enjoy a holiday with me we go to disneyland every time likely won t be going for awhile besides the ridiculous price of u s for a one day flex pass to get into both parks the place is showing its wear the park staff have no sense of humour or interest it s a let s get it done but i have better things to do attitude lack of enthusiasm or interest and if i don t look at you you can t see me experience we had everywhere we went throughout either park simple questions like where is the fastpass station for the colour of wonder show met with avoidance on three occasions the breakdowns of the rides became a running joke california screaming haunted house toontown ride indiana jones log ride buzz lightyear and the grizzley river ride were all closed on the same day what did i pay ca for the five of us for to stand in endless lineups everywhere we went and not get onto the ride the kicker was when each of the rides would be closed down and we had already wasted half an hour in the line up no refunds for this disney how about i start charging you for my time wasted happiest place on earth only if you are drunk i assume there should be a law on how much disney should be allowed to charge for water too at a ml bottle on a day that is well over degrees is absolutely robbery we brought small bottles for each of us that was gone by am we then went through about just in water for the rest of the day seeing how dirty the water fountains are kept us to the bottled variety perhaps another disney strategy bathroom facilities dirty and tons of toilet paper on the floor try sending someone in there periodically to wipe off the counter top and restock the papertowel bang for your buck maybe a once in a lifetime over more days but definitely not for one day legoland is starting to look a better attraction ,2,2013-07-25
4320,What more can be said.,now that disneyland resort has spent a considerable amount of money updating disney s california adventure i now and continue to say that disneyland is on par with disney world disneyland has so many advantages over it s florida counterpart a short walk from either park and a short walk from disney s hotels to either park it s the park that walt disney personally oversaw and built it has rides that florida does not radiator springs world of color california screamin if given a choice i d go to disneyland vs disney world who needs the july august florida humidity ,5,2013-07-23
4321,Need to get their maintenance sorted,we have just got back from our holiday in the us we have been to disney many times across the global network this holiday was in california so we were at the anaheim location the crowds and resulting queues and waiting time made this visit unbearable for me it was only that my child would have been disappointed otherwise i would have packed up and left not only are the waiting times unreasonable the number of breakdowns or in the language of the staff there maintenance work was unprecedented we stood in line in some cases for minutes to be told that the ride was out for maintenance there was no offer of a fastpass or other acknowledgement of the time waisted in a line to nowhere unfortunately i think disney are living on an historical legacy but if they are not carful they will start to loose what is a special brand i will not be back anytime soon ,1,2013-07-23
4322,Just need to take your time,took the family here for days during spring break five days was perfect we didn t have to rush to see everything i recommend getting there early to hit some of the big attractions in the morning we wen t back and napped ever day around pm by doing this we were able to keep the kids there until closing ,5,2013-07-21
4323,KIDS,best place to visit with kids when they are young keep enough days to visit also keep some extra days for rest in between the days when you visit the parks because it is tiring ,5,2013-07-21
4324,It's all about the money!!!,visited disneyland july th cost of two day park hopper for just my wife and i with this was our hotel accommodations expensive disney food we total out at even if everything went perfect this still is way too expensive but we experience disney during a two day period that included five attraction breakdowns and heard from others of two more we approached an attraction that posted a minute stand by time an hour and minutes later we were told that the ride was experiencing technical difficulties and that we could leave and come back later huh fat chance this was typical for our other experiences not only is disneyland food expensive it borderline edible we have decided to forgo anymore disney corp vacations and seek other more bang for the buck options our advice when you are considering a disney vacation don t ,1,2013-07-20
4325,Very Expensive,visited july with my year old daughter and two grand daughters and for a day park hopper was each the year old was free to charge that much for days and then have to wait in lines to do anything for hours is not good to top it off anything you buiy there is so over priced for a beer water anything to eat at one of the cafes was appox per plate they charge you for a stroller rental wow you would think that since the tickets cost so m uch and you reallty don t go on many rides because the wait is just to long that they would give the strollers a much cheaper rental was not impressed with anything there the kids like it but for the parents its almost unaffordable we visited knotts berry farm one day and it was on per son year old free however the things for the kids to do was way better and the line wait for maybe minutes if you think about it by the time you pay to get to get there the hotel charge food and getting into the parks cost more than if we booked a vacation in a resort somewhere like mexico just about anywhere else never would i do that again,2,2013-07-19
4326,Disneyland - Disabled Review.,we purchased a day hopper pass in australia to visit disneyland and california adventure park we had a brilliant time and enjoyed every minute however we learnt the tricks of the trade each day we went avoid disneyland if you are disabled and have jet lag stay at your lodging to get some proper rest before you face the theme parks i found this out the hard way try to go earlier in the day rather than later less people and crowds after pm we noticed that park was suddenly difficult to navigate like a sudden surge of people flooded in disabled people with a mobility issue who need mobility scooter s must come early to get one before am we also saw other disabled people with rental scooters in disneyland so there are other rental scooter places near disneyland if you miss out on the disney scooters be prepared to pay for a mobility scooter is refunded upon return if you are disabled but feel you can walk around all day at least bring something with wheels to cart around bags food drinks and all the other stuff one may pick up all disabled guests can get in via a disabled entry thru the exit for every ride with up to guests we had myself a disabled person in a scooter husband and kids to avoid standing in lines for food or character meet n greets and you are disabled you can ask for assistance to move to the front of the line you may not always be granted this opportunity but if you truly have trouble standing for a longer period of time most of the staff and guests are understanding continue drinking water even whilst using a scooter and try to find the places where fresh fruit and vegetables are offered with meals even at the end of the day scooting around i was still tired make sure you keep one day free the next day to rest and recover enjoy it s the happiest place on earth ,5,2013-07-16
4327,Service does not compare to Walt Disney World.,my first and last trip to disneyland my family and i are walt disney world travelers years plus staying there at their best locations contemporary grand floridian wilderness lodge and the polynesian over the past years we never experienced anything negative at walt disney world we expected the same for disneyland we found the parks to be dirty cast members to be rude crowds in the park not really family oriented and scary looking tons of tattoos and piercing everywhere we asked disneyland s help when we encountered a drug deal going on at our disneyland approved property and was hung up on and told off this was just not one person we ran into about cast members who were rude not just on the phone but also in the parks not really the happiest place on earth they are very unhelpful and if you are handicap their new attractions were made handicap accessible for people only with mobility problems only if you have a handicap person who is unable to wait on long lines due to other medical issues too bad your handicap medical pass gets you no where their only solution is for your parties to separate and call you when they are ready to go in in addition we were threatened on one of their disney approved properties and they upgraded to a dump took pictures to prove it just all around rude people and not worth traveling west for my advice is go to walt disney world if you are able the workers are nicer family friendly cleaner and the resorts are top rated ,1,2013-07-15
4328,"Pricey, plan ahead!",i enjoy disneyland more than disney world i think it s more doable with smaller children plan ahead and purchase your park tickets wisely since they are pricey and you don t want to be stuck buying tickets full price and not know what type of ticket you need ,5,2013-07-13
4329,Love it!!,this was my sixth visit and the first for the kids i always love going to disneyland and will keep going back the lines can be very long so the earlier you get there the better for some reason peter pans flight has the longest line so if you want to ride that one head there first on our second day we headed to the back of the park early and didn t have to line up for anything in toontown we purchased park hopper tickets but if you want to save a little you can get a park a day ticket that is slightly cheaper to make sure you get on every ride you want with minimal wait time plan everything watch the fireworks one night and the next when everyone else is watching them go on some rides when the lines aren t as long just take note of which rides are closed while the fireworks are on can t wait to go again hopefully in a year or two there is nowhere else in the world quite like disneyland ,5,2013-07-12
4330,A bucket list experience,a bucket list experience not so much for the rides lots of out of orders while we were there but the pageantry is what makes this place special parade fireworks fantasmic meeting characters an yr old getting a fist bump from goofy is priceless disneyland may have the best and most friendly staff on the planet it has become quite expensive it is still worth it but set high cost expectations in advance to avoid being frustrated the lines brutal fast pass was not a benefit the day we went half of the attractions were closed or out of order or booked for entire day just stand in line bring your fully charged phones tablets portable game systems etc to help pass the wait times bring a hat mouse ears are fun but hours in the sun demands a hat with a bill or sunscreen it is going to be a long day plan for rest prior and recovery after ,4,2013-07-09
4331,My 69th trip there,you either love it or you don t we do i have been going there for over years and it looks like i will never outgrow it ,5,2013-07-04
4332,Disneyland does great Gluten Free options,our year old daughter is coeliac and while we were in the disneyland park she basically ate like the rest of us there were gf options for pretty much everything she had pizza pasta hot dogs with a bun hamburgers with a bun gf french fries sandwich rolls ice cream it made the whole experience so much better that meal times weren t stressful the udi s bread that they use is really quite nice and our daughter who is very fussy about gf breads ate every bite of each of the different types of bread on offer ,5,2013-07-02
4333,$ Saving Tips for Big Families While at Disneyland,as a father of four and a senior reviewer i decided to write a review to help big families like ours save some money at the happiest place on earth we already know about disneyland and its greatness if you don t get out from under your rock ask a friend and research their website so here are the tips to save money bring food and drinks yes believe it or not the employees are very accommodating about this they understand how expensive it is in the park so they will just remind you at the bag check that the picnic area is to the left of the entrance but they will not ask you to throw it away the advantage to you is that they won t check your bag again at the entrance turnstyle so you can walk right in with your food when you line up for a ride make sure you get a rider switch pass so you can ride again without having to get in another long line you can only do this if you have a child that is not big enough to ride and one parent must stay back with that child the pass will allow your kids to ride twice once with you and once with mom how does this save you money well because the new scam that people do is to pay the handicap to ride with them so they can cut in front of the line true story google it if you are unable to bring food there are decent prized restaurants inside disneyland rancho del zocalo mexican food behind thunder railroad they serve big dishes to share in california adventure boardwalk pizza and pasta share a whole pizza eat the food that you bring for lunch but leave the park for dinner there are a million food choices within a mile radius of the park ranging from mcdonalds to morton s steak house you must buy a two day park hopper it s impossible to do both parks in one day on a non busy day let alone a busy day although this is an expensive ticket it s much cheaper than buying two one day tickets as for parking your out of luck the only way you can save on that is if your hotel offers a free shuttle to the park hot tip get a fast pass early in the morning for the most popular rides such as radiator springs racers ,5,2013-07-01
4334,Just as good as Magic Kingdom,we go to magic kingdom almost yearly and were told that disneyland didn t compare however i disagree it s definitely a smaller park overall and more crowded as the space is not there but it had a certain charm to it it was easy to move between the worlds and had a lot of cool attractions captain eo has definitely run it s course but the small world ride was much better than magic kingdom and indiana jones matterhorn and finding nemo attractions were all must see s the fireworks show was great as usual and could be seen clearly anywhere in park when it comes to customer service and efficiency no one does it better than disney and we had such a great time well worth the trip and offers same value and fun as magic kingdom ,5,2013-06-28
4335,Best Place on Earth,reviews are not necessary because disneyland for families is simply a place where dreams can come true you can see it in the face of any child that enters the park i love taking the family here and we will return as we do every year ,5,2013-06-28
4336,Greatest fun you'll ever share!,i ve been selling disney vacations for years now before this however i loved coming here there s not a better place to spend time with family and friends than the disneyland resort if you re going for your first time i would suggest a day ticket spend entire day in disneyland park and then your nd day at the disney california adventure park use your rd day to go back and forth between the two parks doing your favorite rides and attractions be prepared to spend a lot i can tell you that the average family that goes to disneyland for a vacation has spent years saving tickets can be pricey though you never should pay full price hotels across the street can be about a night depending on the season park food is about a meal per adult and per child merchandise adds up too don t complain about the pricing because there are lots of other cheaper places to go just be prepared to save enough to cover your wants and needs for ticket savings check out vacationeertravels com i would recommend for hotels the desert inn the desert palms suites and the ayres inn orange the actual disney property hotels disneyland hotel paradise pier and grand californian hotel are pricey paradise pier is the cheaper of the then disneyland then the grand from my experience you re paying for location not room benefits like super nice beds most rooms are very standard the grand gives you a private entrance into california adventure park the other two hotels are close by and you can still use the grand s private entrance even if you re not staying there visiting season will make or break your vacation here summers are bad lots of crowds and long waits holidays are bad anytime school is out weekends avoid these unless you don t mind the crowds best visit times are mid week tue thurs you will sacrifice something though for visiting during the slow season mostly park hours open later and close earlier and some of the attractions usually being closed for refurbishment the closest airport to disneyland park is long beach over all the disneyland park is the original magic kingdom there s not a more classic more historic theme park in the world than this one ,5,2013-06-24
4337,Have to have a strategy,disneyland is crowded to get the most out of it and to avoid losing your shirt you need to be prepared check out what rides your kids can go on before you go get the disney wait times app we averaged about rides per day because the lines were so long and the fast passes sold out if you want radiator springs go first thing we never got on bring food and drink with you wait times for these are long too and a bottle of vitamin water costs ,4,2013-06-23
4338,Is Disney going the way of Vegas,we visit disney times a year with our daughter and her family our last visit in june was disappointing it appears as thought the philosophy of disney is changing to give us your money and we will give you nothing in return first the park was dirtier than we had ever seen it in toontown we wanted to sit on a bench however we discovered a dirty diaper and then moved a another bench where we encountered another dirty diaper granted dirty diapers are the fault of sloppy inconsiderate parents however i think disney needs a greater commitment in keeping the park clean there was more litter on the grounds than we had ever seen before yes the lines were long even mid week and the park is crowded there no longer seems to be a quieter time to go to disney that is to be expected however we went to one ride only to discover that it was closed we went directly to another ride and it too was closed we experienced more shut down out of order rides than we had ever experienced on previous visits one afternoon we took our four year old granddaughter to lunch with the princesses she enjoyed it very much each of the featured princesses stopped at our table and talked to her they were patient in posing for pictures the princesses made the event very worthwhile however while service was good the entrees were served cold and we did not like the taste of the food my husband ate one or two bites and then could not eat any more the bus system to and from the park and hotels is slow we waited minutes for our bus to take us to the hotel in the mornings the wait was equally as long with all the money disney charges for admission i think the bus system could be improved the charges for admission seems to keep going up and the services keep going down ,3,2013-06-23
4339,A dream came true!,i was like an over excited child heading to disneyland but considering i have wanted to experience it every since i was little it really was a dream coming true i read about how it can be busy and we tried to plan our trip so it wouldnt be super busy and we did it well we got to disneyland as soon as it opened the first day we just made a plan to start one side and walk around till we had seen everything it work fine for us the longest line we waited in was for splash mountain and in disney adventure was about a hour for the cars ride every other ride we either pretty much got straight on or waited about minutes we got a southern california city pass and it work out to be so much cheaper then buying tickets from disney them self once we got to disney with our city pass it said the tickets we had would have been and we only paid and we got entry to universal and sea world too def worth getting the city pass the only complaint we had was the park open at am considering we got a tour bus to get there we had a very early morning so by am we where hungry we walked to every restaurant and some cafe and everyone told us they don t open till so for lunch we had to get stuck eating fast food eg a mac and cheese hotdog don t get me wrong it still tasted yummy for theme park food just was hoping to get into a restaurant all the staff where super friendly and helpful and the characters where amazing we got a photo pass which was but every where that had a disney photographer we got a photo we had about photos including all our rides photos rides photos are each so the ride photos them self paid for the card plus we got all the character photos when we got home and looked at them on the net we worked out all the photos we got would have cost about if we didn t buy the photo pass if you got a big family with lots of children it is defiantly worth it betweens disney park and adventure we had and amazing two days would defiantly want to go back even though none of the rides where extremely scary i stilled enjoyed them all cannot wait to go back ,5,2013-06-23
4340,The rides at the theme park need improvement.,while my family and i were riding the indiana jones ride it stops for at least minutes so were in the dark at all time until the lights came back then we went over to california adventure while on the car ride it broken down again we have to wait for minutes under it resume also at the little mermaid ride it stop for a few minutes while we were at the middle of the ride i think disneyland need to spend more time maintain their rides ,3,2013-06-18
4341,Same Great DL -- Too Many Teens/Grads,had a great time but it was packed with teens grads if you have small kids avoid going on a grad night day the park is overflowing with gangs of un chaperoned hormone driven grads in like colored t shirts running around screaming for no reason and cutting lines endlessly ,4,2013-06-14
4342,Missing a some of the magic.....,to put it into perspective think of disneyworld as target and disneyland as walmart yes you can get what you need at both places but one of them is cleaner brighter and more polished while i understand that disneyland was the prototype and disneyworld was the final masterpiece i couldn t help noticing that i wasn t feeling the same butterflies that i feel whenever i visit disneyworld disneyland has been describled many times as charming but it actually felt quite obnoxious it was very hard not to compare the two parks but my friend and i spent most of the trip saying this would never happen in the magic kingdom for example you never see off duty castmembers in disneyworld but there they were in disneyland waiting to be picked up in front of the park lounging on their cell phones and looking unhappy also the castmembers weren t as friendly they actually seemed pretty disinterested t he line for dolewhip was like the line for space mountain ridiculous and speaking of lines it seemed that disneyland was lacking in crowd management maybe it s because there are more ride options at disneyworld but i felt like the lines were all pretty long and unmanaged disneyland is located within the city limits so there was more of an opportunity for teenagers to hang out there i kept wondering where were the parents of all these year olds that were making out yuck on the plus side there were some rides that were much better pirates of the carribean and it s a small world were much better at disneyland honorable mentions for nemo s submarine ride and alice in wonderland to summarize visiting disneyland after you ve visited disneyworld is like moving to a one bedroom apartment with roommates after living in a mansion with just your spouse not the worst thing that could happen but certainly not the best oh and one last thought since the park is significantly smaller shouldn t the fee be that way also ,3,2013-06-12
4343,"Disney needs to update, California Adventure is much better",the rides are old and tired couldn t believe they re still showing michael jackson s captain eo unfortunately they can get away with this as long as kids still want to go to disney over any other place on earth very disappointing that children over are charged adult fares ,3,2013-06-12
4344,Nice But Not Good Value,we enjoyed our time at the park and left feeling like we had experienced a good day out but it was pretty pricey for what you got and even though we went outside school holidays and mid week the queues were bad and it really limited how much you could achieve in a day to pay us and spend half your day in queues is not particularly good value in my book this place is just too overcrowded really to rate as great experience for me unfortunately ,3,2013-06-11
4345,Not what Disneyland should be,i go to disneyland on average once a year this was probably my worst experience many of the cast members i talked to were friendly the crowds extremely large for a monday probably due to the first day of summer for a lot of people yesterday are something i can t control but my biggest complaint was the rides if i m going to pay for a ticket now can you at least make sure the rides have regularly scheduled maintenance instead of compromising guest safety happiness by only fixing them when they break down in the middle of the day we waited min appx for indiana jones for instance then had to wait another min because the ride broke down this was the story for at least half the rides we tried to go on they did honor our fast passes as they should ve on top of that i understand that disneyland by default is expensive for food souveneirs but when you re charging for one slice of pizza that is ridiculous overall very frustrating this time around but hey as long as thousands of people pour into the park every day disneyland will continue to employ these outrageous business tactics ,2,2013-06-11
4346,Better than Disney World!,go early in the morning it s worth staying at a disney property to get in early since there are only two parks we felt like we were able to get to more attractions with less time spent traveling we took a break in the afternoon when the park traffic got heavy and came back in the evening we were there during grad nite and the rides and sidewalks got very crowded the longest we waited for a ride was about forty minutes fro the nemo sub most waits were or so minutes and we rode many things several times that we were only able to ride once in florida the park food was pretty diverse but it is expensive we liked the fresh fruit stands around the park cars land was the coolest thing get a fast pass for radiator springs racers early but be sure to check out cars land at night when it s all lit up the song from the movie comes on around pm and the town lights up my three kids ages and enjoyed our trip to disneyland much more than they did our trip to disney world they can t wait to go back ,5,2013-06-11
4347,Great but also dissapointing.,we just got back from our trip and took our kids for the first time to disneyland we have kids it was wonderful and i would highly recommend the fast pass options and stroller switch everyone was very nice and my kids had a wonderful time my biggest complaint though is the character experiences this had to be the most disappointing part of the whole thing we have two girls ages and that love all the characters however when we tried to get pictures with them it never worked about different times we stood in line only for them to say after we stood there for about minutes that it was now over and we had to try again then one time we waited and were up to minnie and they asked for our disney visa my husband said we did not have one and they said well this is only for disney visa holders huh my husband said my visa card that we paid to come here isnt good enough so we walked away with crying girls not understanding why they could not see minnie very frustrating i would recommend the bibbity bobbity boutique though worth it and my girls loved it ,3,2013-06-02
4348,Well worth the trip!,this was our first trip to disneyland we have traveled to disney world several times while disneyland and california adventure were both busy the lines were nothing compared to what you would encounter at disney world we went right when the park opened and within minutes we had enjoyed splash mountain times by lunch it was quite busy and quite warm we left the park after about hours and then returned after dinner and this plan worked well we went with the hopper pass and i recommend that as well additionally we decided to stay offsite the sheraton on harbor blvd because it was considerably less money to stay at very nice hotels within walking distance we typically stay at onsite disney hotels however our entire stay at the sheraton was the cost of night at any of the three disney propeties logistically it worked out fine and i am happy with this decision and would recommend considering this as well ,5,2013-06-02
4349,Beware local holiday scheduling,we visited the park the day after memorial day figuring that the holiday weekend was over and the lines would not be unreasonable boy were we wrong the local schools apparently get both the holiday and the day after off and the park was absolutely packed with local kids there were hour long waits for everything there if you are going to be there anytime around a holiday you may want to call ahead to get a local s perspective on what to expect ,2,2013-05-31
4350,Going downhill and taking customers for granted,definitely not the happiest place around in fact complete rip off world of color do not get ripped off buying the crazy valueless snack pack so you can get tickets to front of line not front of line means you should get there at least hours before the show and line up and hope you get close to the front if you want to wait hours there are lots of free spots without having to spend for worth of cold food in bug land and when the temperature was around f my kids was trying to have fun in the jumping fountains where they can run through splashing water and was shocked when a staff member told them they must be fully clothed with shoes and socks most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my entire life i am not sure why they advertise themselves as the happiest place on earth we seldom saw smiling faces grumpy faces outnumber happy ones check it out for yourself we went the week of may and line ups were mostly minutes i know disney can do many thing to speed up the lines but why would they they have collected your and why would they care many rides were shut down throughout the day with no reason given ,2,2013-05-26
4351,still the happiest place on earth,i had a bittersweet visit this year my father actually built many of the attractions at disneyland in the early s so i feel as if this is my second home my father passed away about a week before i was scheduled to visit so i made sure to visit new orleans square and the train ride around the park and look at the diaramas which he built even though it can be crowded disneyland is the master of making lines move fast and often interesteing of course you know you can read the hieroglyphics in the indiana jones ride went to carsland what a hoot my only complaint is that the race is too short as far as expense where else in the world can you go and get broadway quality shows live music and entertainment and rides for the price my advise is take advantage of all the detail disney offers dont just race from ride to ride but really enjoy the atmosphere which is created to the smallest detaisl most people miss it but i know the painstaking care they put into this place its still the happiest place on earth for me ,5,2013-05-19
4352,Just love this place,have been coming here every year since cannot find fault with it my favourite place on earth can t wait for next visit,5,2013-05-12
4353,"Beware of the differences between Metrorail vs Metrolink, and Anaheim St vs Anaheim City",and so i took the metrorail for hour to go to anaheim st so that i can go to disney land la when i alighted i saw outskirts and sporadic and unglamourous buildings how can this be the beautiful city that houses disney land la which city allows her transportation system to have confusing names like metrorail and metrolink which serves different purposes metrorail is actually the subway within la and metrolink is the inter city train to other cities which city name anaheims st within her city when there is an anaheim city just outside of her city in the end i ran out of time to visit disney land la ,5,2013-05-12
4354,Disney at Spring Break,disney at spring break very crowded most of the rides were about minutes to hour wait times we were only able to get one fast pass for space mountain disney needs to rethink fastpass admission for one day was each the park hopper would have been and there is no way to see both parks in a single day so you would waste your money or die trying to see everything we stayed away from the park about minutes away so it was convenient to get there and of course had to deal with parking got there around am and stayed until almost midnight because someone handed us a fastpass for space mountain for an pm time slot they let us on the ride at though we were there on the friday of spring break week maybe should have planned it for mid week instead but we were busy doing other things all in all was a great time and we were tired and will go to california adventure for next time prices are waaaaayyyy to high ,4,2013-05-07
4355,can think of some improvements,there are a few things they should improve for example everyone has to stay in long lines on almost any ride there it is a given but they can improve people s line experience for sure for example we were there on a very hot day kids and years old and it is really hard for them shade stands would really be helpful on such a popular ride as small world for example it is not difficult to make may be offer some small entertainment for kids while they are waiting may be for little kids they can offer rides for a ride they really like so they don t need to stay in line again small improvements like this would make the whole experience much better ,4,2013-05-07
4356,Discover the Magic Tour,if you are looking for something different and want to entertain the kids without waiting in line the discover the magic tour is fun go throughout the park skip a few lines on some favorites and meet the big guy for a nice long visit ,4,2013-05-07
4357,Who doesn't love Disneyland???,we come here annually and love every second of the trip the one thing in this world they got right it may be expensive but aren t all good things in life ,5,2013-05-03
4358,Magical!,we thoroughly enjoyed our days at disneyland it is truly a magical place took our year old daughter and she loved every minute of it from meeting the princesses to riding indiana jones the park is absolutely immaculate and staff is very friendly and helpful we love the fastpass system which we used for splash mountain our daughter rode it times and indiana jones hungry bear restaurant was pretty good and the dole whips were delicious met many characters really like that they have designated spots to go line up to meet them loved fantasmic and the fireworks as well as the parade my advice is to avoid going to disneyland when there is a convention at the anahein convention centre this made it very crowded there even on weekdays only complaint is that major rides were not running while we were there space mountain finding nemo subs and big thunder mountain i felt that this was a lot of major rides closed and it was irritating we were prepared for thunder mountain closure as it was noted on the disney website before we went but to have others closed really sucked apart from the closures we still had a great time at this truly magical place that doesn t have the feel of a theme park but more of an enchanted land great job disney ,5,2013-05-01
4359,So Much More Than Rides. Travelled with children 7 and 9.,we had day park hopper tickets and needed four of those days for sure it took days to get through each park if you are there over a weekend make sure you see fantasmic it s worth keeping the kids up for we had one person take a blanket and stake out a spot hour before while we did rides in the area jungle cruise is neat at night having a camelback for water rather than bottle was perfect people who dont use fast passes are crazy if you want to go on cars make sure you are lined up outside california adventure about hour before park opens then go straight to fast pass line on a weekday the fast passes were gone by am a great ride take advantage of all the shows they re amazing aladdin is top notch broadway production the drawing classes in cal adv are great the kids enjoyed them so much we would straight back for the next class did five in all colour of wonder fast passes were great you still need to get there early to stake out your spot we were in the blue section and sat on the stairs down the lower wet area they said we would get wet but we didnt at all great view fast passes for cars and color dont count toward the fast passes you can hold ,5,2013-04-28
4360,Some new attractions make the Happiest Place on Earth even happier,the plan was to spend the first day of our la trip at universal hollywood the next three days at disneyland and then on the last day as we drove north back to norcal we would stop by universal again for a half day universal was good hadn t been there in years a lot of it had changed over the years but after six hours there we d done everything we wanted to do no one in the family was interested in going back again so we added an extra day to our day disney ticket and it was worth it the recently added rides at disney and california adventures definitely kept us busy at disneyland we saw both shows at the new royal theater in fantasy faire they were both great the boys didn t want to see the shows at first thought they were too princess ey but we made them go and they loved the show lots of comedy some singing star tours was another new ride for us lines were a bit long but lots of things to look at while you wait and the ride itself was fantastic california adventures the new cars land and the buena vista area were great radiator springs is one of the best disney rides ever get the fastpass as soon as you arrive in the morning ,5,2013-04-20
4361,Well,its disneyland after all major fun most of the time but i would like to go someday when the place is not jam packed world class facility,5,2013-04-17
4362,Not As Nice As the Magic Kingdom,crowded lines on top of lines we went on a monday in the pouring rain not a holiday after spring break season ended it was about degrees within minutes of the park opening peter pan had a minute wait of course an average disney park is still a disney park so don t avoid it because of lines just know that disneyland desperately needs to extend its operating hours to accommodate the crowds this park could easily be open am am every day and still feel crowded ,3,2013-04-17
4363,Princess Heaven,my six year old daughter loved visiting here as she loves the whole disney princess thing at various locations through the park the princesses sign autographs and pose for photos yes it s all fake and they are trained actress but my daughter loved it and it made her happy and that makes us happy they are very well trained and do make you feel your kid is important my daughter confidentially told us that all the princesses live together in the castle at disneyland they say its a magical place and truely it was for my daughter the park it s self was spotless and the queues moved very well better than any u k theme park ,5,2013-04-17
4364,M.I.C.K.E.Y.M.O.U.S.E.,always a treat to go here it is truly the happiest place on earth all staff are happy and helpful customers don t even mind queuing for the rides tips make use of the magic morning to get to the world of colour ticket stand so you can get a good area you can order a picnic online in advance and you get a good ticket if you don t want to get to the park too early but must be ordered a day in advance the rollercoaster in califonia adventure park is the best the park gets very busy from mid day so you will find the shorter queues in the morning and even shorter if it is a cloudy day use your tickets to book fastpasses on the ones with long lines ,5,2013-04-16
4365,I am a fan of Disneyland but this is not the best one,i always loved disney but i think it is crazy expensive it should be affordable for anyone to experience it that was walt disney wish i loved toons town indiana jones is just amazing nemo s submarines very cute the atmosphere of course disappointing space mountain paris one is best from far avoid the bobsleighs snowy mountain ,4,2013-04-16
4366,spring break crowds were not all that bad,we goofed and booked disneyland during school break in march the crowds were certainly there but the parks are built to handle lots groups worked out well don t hesitate just relax take a few breaks and a well stocked wallet and enjoy,5,2013-04-15
4367,Happiest place on earth,all i can say is my year old said dad this really is the happiest place on earth nuff said even i had a great time even though not being a ride best rides are indiana jones and the grizzly river ride tip get there early go on the best rides which dont have fastpass and keep a fastpass available all day fornthe really populr rides,5,2013-04-14
4368,First trip to Disneyland!,we had a day park hopper and we could have easily used another full day loved the fast pass option saved us a lot of waiting ,5,2013-04-14
4369,Another Wonderful Time for the Family,we visited disneyland during the nd week of april with a day park hopper pass this was during our spring break week which seemed to be after most other schools had their break so the park was not very busy which was good for us most of the rides had a wait time of minutes from our last visit in december disneyland itself hasn t changed much most of the improvements were made to california adventures with the addition of cars land and the new buena vista shops as such it seemed busier in dca than in dl unfortunately for us a few of the rides we were waiting in line for broke down e g autopia monorail because we were staying at the grand californian hotel we got in hour early with the magic hour entrance if you have this option use it it will allow you to ride the popular rides without the long wait times one thing to note is that not all rides are running during this magic hour in fact during our visit to dl only fantasyland tomorrowland and main street was open in any case you re inside the park and have already beat the crowd when it turns am and all of the lands opened we were the first people on the splash mountain ride and were allowed to ride several times in a row before more people showed up one final tip if you wait until just before the park closes for us that was at pm you can probably get on some of the popular rides with no waiting we did this for the indiana jones ride and the matterhorn no waiting just walked right up ,5,2013-04-13
4370,Cars Land - SO WORTH IT!!!,first trip to disneyland since cars land opened what a treat it is beautiful during the day and also quite spectacular when light up at night cozy cones motel chili bread cones are fun pretty good testing and probably among the most economical food in the park radiator springs racers best experienced as single rider to avoid the hour wait but parents beware children must be of a certain age or size we sadly saw parents and children disappointed by having waited in the minute single rider line to then be turned away ask before waiting as it seemed like rules changed based on who was manning front of the line also fast pass distribution for the radiator springs racers typically run out within first hr of park opening so if you don t get a fast pass for the ride first thing then fast passing it is not an option these issues aside the ride is so fun and shouldn t be missed shops in cars land have some unique gifts to bring home that were liked by kids of all ages as was the ability to take a picture with talking mater or lighting mcqueen if you haven t been to disney since cars land opened it is time to head back ,5,2013-04-13
4371,Perfect,in a way better than expected we have been to florida disneyworld before and everyone said this will be a disappointment after that i feel it was better on a slightly smaller scale but with everything there you have to get here early and you can do the rides you want by o clock there is still plenty to do afterwards but you avoided the queues we were here by am when they open and had no problems doing what we wanted to do we had to wait almost an hour though to meet minnie mouse in her lovely cottage but it made my year old daughter s holiday ,5,2013-04-13
4372,It's disneyland!!,there is nothing i could write to explain the magic of taking my two children to disneyland they are and and people said they wouldn t be able to do anything or go on anything they had the time of their life the parades the children s rides and the whole experience was amazing ,5,2013-04-12
4373,Great during low season,we made the mistake of coming during spring break and lines were insane the cars ride was hour minutes most of the good rides had minute waits be wise and strategic with your fast passes and you can still see everything on a busy day we have taken our kids here times in years and they still love this place like no other i would recommend going in early december or may or september where lines are at a minimum it is much more enjoyable even though your kids will miss some school ,5,2013-04-11
4374,rides kept breaking down,we were looking forward to going to disneyland and disney s california adventure park we got a day park hopper ticket since we were only going to be there for the days unfortunately some of the rides were shut down due to problems and that was very disappointing when you pay per day to go to a place you expect things to be working we lined up for the cars ride at am fastpasses at that time were for pm and waited until am when the ride broke down after another minutes it still wasn t fixed so we left very disappointed we walked over to the roller coaster california screamin the wait time was listed as minutes minutes into the wait they announced that there was a delay again problems with the ride in the evening when we wanted to go to the indiana jones ride it was down ,3,2013-04-10
4375,Not where dreams come true,since the late s i have been privileged to visit disneyland anaheim on one exciting occasion my brother and i met mr walt disney he was kind gracious and everything we expected this was the grand opening of the submarine ride complete with live mermaids during the coming years we were lucky to return to the magic kingdom and a great time was had by all i have waited for years to take my grandson to disneyland and we planned for over a year making all arrangements through disney travel we expected it to be the dream vacation i must say our accommodations at the marriott suites were what we expected our day hopper passes and extras were included and everything was in order so off we go for the adventure of a life time we decided to start with the california adventure our grandson s choice little known to us our first adventure was to wait in line for an hour just to enter the park followed by another wait in line to get our lanyards and pass covers which we thought would be a good idea as we were going to need them for four days finally we reach the first ride of choice the cars race track at the beginning of the ride the time was minutes two hours later i got a message from my husband that they were going to need sweaters as the sun was now setting and the temperature was dropping rapidly after a hour wait our grandson got on the ride and it was over in about minutes after the long long wait everyone was hungry and we began our search for food the choices were varied fast food or expensive meals at restaurants that were a good deal away from our location or a wait time of over an hour exhausted we gave up and went to our hotel and had a great dinner at red robin we returned to the park and managed to see a few more things but cannot justify the cost per adventure to the ticket price it was about per attraction per person my recommendation to disneyland parks is to limit the visitors to the park it was like being in a sardine can that was over filled i love disneyland but before i go again there will be limits to the number of people they allow in if you are going to the park bring money go early at opening time have back backs with sweaters sun screen and a piece of fruit the snacks are scandalously priced with a cent bag of plain potato chips at as an example make a plan and stick to it if possible or have a close alternative get fast passes early before noon if possible be prepared to wait in lines everywhere drink water and located bathrooms early in the future i think i will go for knott s berry farm and the beach ,3,2013-04-10
4376,Is it really worth it?,after this last visit i wonder if it s really worth day to wait for hours on end to enjoy a second ride spend time in the queue for everything from going to the washroom to grabbing a meal to paying for your souvenirs you gotta line up and wait for everything overpriced from the funnel cakes drinks and the ice cream bars to the poorly prepared and pathetically presented meals in dangerously over crowded restaurants to the key chains mugs t shirts stuffed plushies which by the way you could pick up at the abc store less than a block from the maingate for mere pennies same stuff it s all over priced crowded crowded crowded can t find a seat in the restaurants can t find a spot to watch the parades can t find a spot to sit and watch the water show even after being directed to a specific spot by an employee only to be told later by another employee that we couldn t sit there we were then directed to sit behind this bush over here that s partially blocked by that garbage can which of course is hidden behind that fence which is then blocked by people we ended up just hopping into the queue to get out of this place and watched an ad for the watershow on our hotel disney channel so in a nutshell not the best experience went with some older family members this time and were completely disappointed and frustrated no character s running about like before the parades had less floats than before the addition of the watershow only turned into a huge disappointment thankfully when we were there last time with young family members we got to see mickey minnie goofy even though the niece was terrified of him max princesses the parade was totally worth the wait then i m just glad that this time it was only adults who were able to live with the disappointments a word of advice to those families out there who are planning a trip to la to do the disney thing come in february or november take your kids out of school and avoid the peak season cheaper to fly to la cheaper for hotels no ridiculous lines queues crowds it may be worth the outrageous prices if there aren t those things to worry about after all was said and done we were joking that for an extra a night we could have got a parkside room and watched the fireworks nightly from the room and saved on the park fee especially since the best view of the new watershow was looping on the hotel s disney channel endlessly day in day out so paying for a day of waiting waiting waiting and waiting only be just so frustrated that we left the park early is it worth it ,2,2013-04-08
4377,Busy times advice,spring break at disney insanely busy but if you do your research and adjust your schedule you can ride almost all of the rides yes you can and disney is the amusement park that you do not mind paying admission because of all the details they put into every ride show and parade and i cannot even count all the workers with brooms cleaning the pavement we walk on cleaning bathrooms scrubbing trash cans etc and almost every employee had a smile and kind word for all their guests clean park happy workers tell me another place in the usa where you can find this i do not or ever have worked for disney but i have been to their florida location four times and this is our second visit to california our last visit was years ago my husband and i are in our early s and our son is this time around so we were able to adjust quickly first being in california after a cold winter is your first reason to be happy really awesome weather we had i will try to give you all the advice i researched for hours and please use tripadvisor really it is your best tool forums articles all reviews it will help you arrange your best strategy for attacking this park to suit your family s needs the fireworks and water shows are awesome after hours of research use all other sites just google disney strategy and biggest strategy use your smart phones there are many apps to give you recommendations wait times at all the rides even food stands wait times they are about accurate use your fastpass please note they are now very strict on your fastpass time window this is new for disney they used to let you return anytime after your window not anymore sometimes just standing in front taking pictures of the rides people approached us and asked us if we wanted to use their fastpass they could not use it use a fastpass runner use the single rider line this saved us so much time we do like to ride together but when you want to ride the matterhorn bobsleds five times you basically walk past a minute wait line and walk on in five minutes it does not always happen but you will cut your wait time in half or no wait at all enjoy all of the park the little nooks provide quiet time and the little details that only disney puts into all their rides and every inch of their parks amazing expensive food yes but use this also there are food bargains bengal bbq earl of sandwich in downtown disney and others they allow you to carry water into the park and also soda if it is in small plastic bottles they have numerous water fountains to refill if needed they are also strict with their iphone app scanning your pass for confirmation while you still need to scan your ticket also i saw many complaining but they were more cautious than the tsa at the airport i know i felt safer in their parks i also watched security come out of no where and stop a child from leaving the park on their own one day i could go on and on but most of this is found on this site remember it is your vacation and you are not at work and this family time is something you and your children will always remember have fun ,5,2013-04-07
4378,Fun in the Air Everywhere ... But !!!,first to mention is the unusual number of visitors at the park at this time of the year being spring break it more than doubled from our last trip in april of it was too crowded there s not enough room to move around anyway it looked like this visit will be a wonderful experience since the weather is good mostly overcast a little breezy at times we live in las vegas nv and my wife our kids myself took a car trip to visit disneyland park california science center it s not often that we can visit so we want to enjoy it as much as our feet can endure walking we drove some miles from ramada inn in costa mesa where we are staying to the park when we got in at am we picked up guide maps lists of attractions rides so we can plan our movements without losing time effort it didn t work when we got to an attraction or a ride we want the line is always long with a wating time of minutes so we kept moving looking for short lines sometimes we got separated with our kids because they have more patience waiting in line the fastpass is a good idea but there s still a line even with the sceduled times by noon we were lucky to see some attractions shows got some rides the most exciting ride we had was at splash mountain by now all the walking waiting made us very weary tired hungry we could hardly walk looking for a place to get lunch we found a short line at cafe orleans after lunch more walking waiting in line it s now pm mickey s soundsational parade is about to start we arrived too late at the parade route the curbs were already filled with people already seated we got separated i was able to squeeze myself in front of a tree and i was able to take a good video of the entire parade after the parade our kids want to get more rides but my legs were giving up my wife i let them go for maybe another hour meanwhile we found this cart selling huge turkey leg roast for we took but we couldn t even finish eating it for hour my son finished it for us when they got back they too are tired by now but they still want to see the fireworks at pm but that s still a long hour wait we saw the fireworks on our last visit so i told them if you ve seen one you ve seen them all i hope i was right on our way back to the hotel our kids said we only saw about half of the attractions half of the rides they are right but i told them it s because we spent half of the time walking waiting in line anyway i said i had a wonderful time although it it would have been a really perfect experience if we came on an ordinary weekday then there would have been fun in the air everywhere ,3,2013-04-06
4379,Love it.,this is still the happiest place on earth one of the few perks of having a child with autism is the treatment given at disneyland our family had a wonderful time and could be together like a typical family because of the guest assistance pass to help us with long lines we all loved cars land my son especially he felt like he was with all of his friends from the cars movies and kept up a running commentary on all of the buildings etc it looks like you have just stepped into radiator springs i commend disney on this new addition radiator springs racers is one of the best rides they have it will rank up there with other classics like peter pan pirates and haunted mansion very well done the new princess fantasy faire is also a great invention the show there was so fun and being able to see four or five princesses with only a short wait in one line was great that was very good planning one treasure that we experienced for the first time is the golden horseshoe show with billy hill and the hillbillies i read about it in the unofficial guide to disneyland and decided to check it out it was one of the highlights of our trip and will be on our must do list for future trips i highly recommend it ,4,2013-04-05
4380,Love Disneyland,so crowded people were rude and crossing in front no manners way to crowded couldn t move without being ran over or running someone over ,5,2013-04-01
4381,terrible,that s basically what we did we paid to stand in line we paid to be among crowds of people we paid too much to eat carnival type food this is more of a warning than a criticism of the park as many people love disneyland and are undeterred apparently if you don t mind long lines throngs of people and mediocre food then this is the place for you i didn t see any of the disney magic i tried i tried to be patient and have a positive attitude but it just didn t make sense to me to pay that much to wait to be in crowds and eat bad food ,1,2013-03-28
4382,You pay to wait in line,its a minute walk from hilton double tree suites anaheim we booked the single day single park tickets the night before we did not have a printer and saved the barcodes on my mobile phones which it was very easy to scan at the entrance on a sunday it was very crowded with families and strollers expect plenty of walking and queuing in the line for popular rides it could get as long as minutes wait water fountains are available in the park and you can fill up your water bottle easily the turkey leg sold at the carts are huge and tasty worth a shot if you have not done it before the parade was nice before dinner dinner time was another mad queue for restaurants seating ordering of food lots of guests wanted to have their chow before fireworks during winter the outdoor warmers were comfortable at the restaurant the fireworks at the end of the night is superb which my wife and i felt was the highlight of the trip ,1,2013-03-27
4383,Crowded Park,this place is magic a first visit for in our party of and a visit we will never forget it s so wonderful to truly feel like a kid again and see the excitement that your kids feel on the rides the lines are always moving we jokingly refer to the lines as the real disney magic because although they can be long because they are always moving you never end up standing there feeling defeated there is always hope that you re getting somewhere fantasyland is great for the little one s we loved every ride they are all so special in their own way be prepared to have a lot of walking bring those running shoes and bottles of water we found that starting early and finishing by pm or so gave us time to get back to our hotel for a swim and then sometimes back out for some night time rides ,3,2013-03-22
4384,Nothing compared to Disneyworld.,same price as disneyworld yet with half the rides thunder mountain railroad haunted mansion and tom s sawyer boat ride all broken and not open very very crowded you would think they would limit the number of people coming in compared to disneyworld this park is very outdated and needs to either reduce the price or let people use both parks for i will not go here again ,2,2013-03-19
4385,"Love, love, love Disneyland!!!",we are disney world pass holders and love it but in our opinion disneyland is even better our kids loved the fact both parks california adventure and disneyland are side by side you still walk a lot but it is not as bad as trying to visit parks in fl we went for days and rode just about every ride we compared all the same rides in ca and fl and disneyland was in our opinion superior lines were not terrible but do get fast passes for popular rides waiting times were about minutes longer than on sign but moves fast we were so excited to ride the nemo submarine ride it reminded me of the one disney world used to have it was nostalgic we thought ride quality was better rides were smoother and cleaner plenty of food choices and good at all the ones we ate at this park was even friendlier than disney world disneyland is beautiful and we can t wait to come back after all this is walts dream park and he saw it completed his way and it is awesome you can even feel his heart was in the making of this beautiful family fun park enjoy and make memories ,5,2013-03-19
4386,Almost the happiest place on Earth.,disney is overrated expensive the food is terrible and over expensive wherever you go in the park the parade at the end is fun but even that got stuck and we left before it ended you wait on average minutes at a time in lime ups for mins of rides therefore you are lucky if you get minutes of fun during the entire day and that was even the week before spring break don t think we ll ever go back to anaheim ,4,2013-03-18
4387,Very disappointing,disneyland is expensive crowded and tiring it s also totally amazing i love love love disneyland there really is some type of magic in the air the music food and just overall atmosphere put s you in a good mood that the other stuff doesn t even matter coming from a single parent household growing up i never got to go to disney so when i take my kids once a year and i see the excitement on their faces and how happy they are i know that these are life long memories go now and eat a big turkey leg and pickle for me ,3,2013-03-16
4388,Life long Memories,we went to disneyland and california adventure for one day which was insufficient we were with people who bought a day pass which i think would be necessary if you want to really cover the attractions it was a school day tuesday in february and very bad weather the rain for that day had been predicted well ahead later we learned that the parks were full that day and full the next day which was sunny a friend from la says that even decades ago she waited for bad weather to go to disneyland my son and his wife planned ahead they knew which attractions had fast passes available how to arrange for reserved seating for the laser light show and which rides they would skip we only had one wait that was unacceptably long the submarine ride that has become a finding nemo attraction even with that in the hours we were there we covered very little we went back and forth between the two parks primarily because of the fast pass times we never had to wait doing this so don t feel you must complete one park before going to the other some attractions are a bit threadbare the submarines were not worth a long wait the matterhorn roller coaster seats are unpadded and the restraint allows you to slide a lot i felt i was being bruised new and not to miss radiator springs racers fast passes were gone by noon in looking at the park maps i see a lot we missed my grandchildren are young i ll have other opportunities ,5,2013-03-14
4389,A Must!,as one reviewer said it is not fair to compare disneyland to disney world so i will not another writer said that a day park hopper is not enough i disagree i suggest that you arrive when the gates open at disneyland rather than attend the attractions closest to the gate as most people will do go straight to the parts of the park where no one will be in our first two hours we went on a number of top attractions with zero wait time including space mountain and star tours plan the use of your fastpasses wisely in both parks you can have a fastpass active in disneyland while you also have one active in california adventure i am guessing that many people see california adventure as disney s second best park in anaheim but do not skip it with a park hopper pass we were able to manage our fastpasses and swiftly move between both parks get there early and stay all day this will enable you to explore both parks thoroughly if you want to save money as we did revisit your car to eat your main meals as a picnic we parked in the pumbaa lot ,5,2013-03-14
4390,not really worth the money,we visited for days in february from australia and we had the best time together this is such a magical place that both adults and children can genuinely enjoy together there is so much to see here even in days we didn t see everything my daughter loved all the characters the parades and the rides it was a holiday we will never forget the first few days were quiet and a few of the major rides were closed but the shorter lines were definitely worth missing a few rides towards president s day weekend it became packed however we had already went on most of the rides and so were able to go on the rides that had opened after refurbishment and enjoy the parades the weather was fine only one drizzly cooler day during the whole week the parks were open from am pm which was sufficient with a young child and to pm on the weekend it s definitely worth coming during less busy weeks of the year check the crowd predictor calendars to work out the best times waiting hours in line with children can be miserable all the staff here were so friendly and helpful the park is clean there are bathrooms everywhere perfect with little ones and places to grab something at every corner the bibbidi bobbidi boutique was so special for my little princess highly recommended we did the crown package which was about and also bought a dress they transform their hair into a princess style paint their fingernails put some light make up on etc you get to take home a special bag a make up palette two nail polishes a tiara and several cute other goodies also if it s your first visit make sure you come through the main entrance and not on the monorail to tomorrow land so you can get all the park maps and meet the many characters on main street do a bit of research there is so much excellent information online to plan the attractions you would like to visit check before hand if your children are tall enough for certain rides and learn how the fasspass works i was so surprised how many people were unaware fastpasses existed and they are very useful enjoy ,3,2013-03-14
4391,Every child's dream (and adult),this was an amazing place thought it would be just something you whiz around in day luckily we bought a day pass tip buy it online it was cheaper unexpectedly the food was good value for money and quality was above average lining up for the rides like a big kid was a sometimes lengthy until we discovered the fast pass system only available at certain rides but allows you instant access however you can only hold one fast pass at at time and it is time restrictive e g you entry will be in mins and only last mins or so the indiana jones ride was the best we tried and the log one however be prepared to get drenched i loved all the shops and bought all sorts of things to take home such as t shirt lollies etc that we just don t see in australia had to fight the little kids off to get a photo with mickey walked away from disneyland feeling high on life ,5,2013-03-08
4392,Tips to ensure all the fun,everybody knows what to do in disneyland but just some pointers to make it more enjoyable for you and family days pass just enough if you going for other theme parks like universal studio legoland and shopping but if you want more of rides than shopping you may take the days pass early entry you get to choose which day you wish to get early entry hr earlier for california adventure or disneyland don t choose on the st day on the st day decide which rides that you have missed or wish to ride again use the early entry to get these rides please do note that some rides are only open at later timings fireworks at disneyland world of colours at california adventure park you can go and watch the shows on different days its too rushing to do it all in night at disneyland fireworks show people will book sittings on the floor as early as pm but as the show starts everybody has to stand churros are great try them rides for popular rides take the ticket for advance timing to avoid queuing few hours ,5,2013-03-06
4393,A Great Vacation,i grew up in central california so trips to disneyland were part of my growing up experience as an adult i ve moved away from ca but i still love to visit diseyland with my husband and kids whenever we visit grandparents here are a few helpful hints when planning a trip to disneyland buy borrow or beg a copy of bob sehlinger s the unofficial guide to disneyland this book is amazing now that our visits to ca usually happen at christmas break spring break or summer break we usually visit the park at peak tourist times the good news is that most rides restaurants and shows are open the bad news is that you get to share the park with other families who visit the same day the unofficial guide will literally save you hours of waiting in line follow the plans follow the plans follow the plans they really work my husband did not grow up visiting disneyland like i did and had his own ideas of what the day should be like when we visited for the first time with our own children without a plan you will waste most of your day in line my husband learned that visiting disneyland with a plan made all the difference for example we had a day pass for the busiest peak tourist time month of summer with the touring plans from the unofficial guide we had literally been on every ride by the end of the morning of day and our favorites we had done multiple times stay close find a hotel you re comfortable with as close to the main gate as possible we ve stayed at the park vue inn anaheim del sol inn and disney s grand californian hotel the grand is beautiful and comfortable but is actually a greater distance from disneyland s main gate both park vue and del sol are right beside denney s which is great for a less expensive meal during the day they also have mini refrigerators in the room which we stocked with breakfast foods for each morning the grand did not if you arrive in anaheim from out of state there is a target south on south harbor blvd you ll need a car to get there but it s worth the trip to stock up on snacks water bottles breakfast foods etc leave the park mid day as the crowds get bigger and the sun gets hotter you will benefit from a mid day break go back in the late afternoon evening as the crowds begin to thin and the temperatures begin to drop enjoy ,5,2013-03-04
4394,Poor ticket entrance process,my overall experience would have been a great one if it hadn t been for the new ticket entrance process at disneyland each line has two customer reps one takes a picture of you and the other checks for the validate date while my family was waiting in line for a magic morning the person in front of us had mistakenly taken another family member s ticket and the line was held up after minutes i asked if my family could get through at the next line but the rep said she already verified our pictures so we had to stay in the current line another minutes passed and the people behind us also started complaining and walking to other lines so my family followed once i got into the park i went to guest services and complained that half of our magic morning was ruined with this poorly executed process and bad customer services oh did i mention that the device that disney uses for picture validation is slow and it takes about twice the time to get into a park also it is not fun at all if you have a park hopper ticket and have to go through the same ticket validation with each re entrance ,2,2013-02-26
4395,Must do!,my husband and i spent two fantastic days at disneyland and he isn t a big disney fan we had a two day hopper pass so could go between disneyland and california adventure which i think is the perfect pass to get i think a three day pass is a bit too much i recommend getting to disneyland for opening time and having a bit of a plan about which rides you want to go on most and heading to these rides first before the lines get too long also remember to use fast passes if it gets busy we didn t need to use these because we were getting on rides per hour when we went mid january it was pretty quiet i was a bit worried about going at this time of year because it was winter but the weather was quite warm and didn t impact on our time here we loved our time at disneyland this theme park is a must do in your lifetime ,5,2013-02-25
4396,Disneyland has deteriorated too much for the money,for the ridiculous prices disney is now charging their people should be polite like in the recent past their food should at least be tasty if it can t be a bit less expensive,2,2013-02-22
4397,How can you not LOVE this place :),my family and i love disneyland our trip this time was great and even though it was busy it was still very enjoyable the best thing to do is have a plan and go early for the parade to get a good spot especially if you have little ones that want to see this was my first time during christmas and is my most favorite time at disneyland its is all decorated and festive couldn t get any better we always stay off site as there are many great choices also if yo u can you should do a character meal at least once ,5,2013-02-22
4398,Just fantastic!,it really is as good as we had read on trip advisor we enjoyed every moment every single employee was just so friendly happy and helpful we loved the photo system buy a photopass get as many photographers to take photos as possible during your time there we took home over professional photos for just including ride photos well worth it the disney princess meet was fabulous and took just minutes to queue we were lucky enough to see princesses whilst we were there as they had a change over there was so much to see and do we spent days in the parks we did everything we wanted to by utilising the fastpass system which is just fantastic we could have spent longer but days was enough for us definitely worth every penny and there was something for everyone ages adults children aged we loved the fact that the food was healthy and not chicken nuggets chips for children everywhere there is so much to say about how wonderful a place it is for those that want huge rides stick to california adventure park get to disney early if you want to make the most of it choose the popular rides first to avoid huge queues there is an app that tells you where the characters are how long fastpass waits are which is really useful be aware that everyone plays their role if they are dressed up so greet them as if they are who they are dressed as you have to stay watch the fireworks as they really are fabulous the water show in california adventure park is worth a see ,5,2013-02-22
4399,We preferred universal studio for rides,i thought there would be more rides for adults w had a really great day at universal studious the day before so were a little disappointed with disneyland a few of the rides were closed down for maintenance which we didn t know about until we got into the park would have been good to see what rides they had before entering as we may have preferred disneyland adventure park rides w went on a weekday but the lines were still crazy the only ride that s really fun for adults we thought was space mountain some of the rides are a bit outdated good for little kids as there are heaps of kids rides but next time i would try out knots berry farm or something else instead ,3,2013-02-19
4400,Horrible!,why can t you put lower than one star we picked a mon ties wed in august to try avoid crowds how wrong we were well the crowds were not bad the manners of the crowds were bad awaiting the maaterhorn we waited for hours while people in front of us let freinds and family into the line we questioned a cast memeber and was told what do you want us to do after over a hour wait we passed the sign that said minute wait we exited the same thing happened on many rides we purchased a special picnic to asure us a good place to watch worl of color temp over degress with no where to sit minutes before show they let in s of people in our special area we had a good place to watch until s got in front of us same thing happened at fireworks sitting on hot pavement and then cast memebers tell us we could sit on ground so we stood for minutes we had made a reservation for carthey circle resturant we arrived minuts early and were told there would be a hour and wait why take reservations we got fast passes for cars at am the fast pass was for pm we got in line and still had to wait hours as we were told they wanted to clear up single line when i arrived home i wrote a letter to guest relations they wrote back to say it was a corprate form letter would be a understatment asking why we didnt go to guest realtions in town sqaure get out of line to complain about the long line and people allowing friends to enter asked why we didnt talk to cast meember i told them in letter i spoke to many cast members and none were very helpful then they had the nerve i think they were being funny to give up front of line passes for rides but they were not good on matterhorn or cars the rides i complained about i guess they thougth they were being funny they gave me the regualr bs about no refund i reminded them that because something said no refund there are expections if a non refubdable ticket on a plane is canceled they give you your money back if you have opera tickets and it is cancaled you get your money back i don t believe that they even read my letter just did the old send him excuse letter they should be ashamed of them selfs calling it guest relations i will never go back and tell everyone how bad we wer treated by disneyland it is so clear disneyland wants one thing your money once they have it they have no interest in helping anyone we spent over dollars for day passes the happest place on earth they shoud be sued for false advirtising ,1,2013-02-19
4401,what is all the fuss about?,our family of including one free child paid to get in to do what we got to see features rides since we spent all the time in line ups and this is february to the see tinkerbell was over an hour wait waited minutesbut never got to see mickey as we were told we had to wait at least another minutes to see it for a place so busy it was hard to find food we had to walk over minutes to find something as compared to san diego zoo or seaworld is a lot of money to spend to be in line ups all day and obviously disney does not have to give a damn as the place was crowded and we were told even more crowded in the summer months so bottom line is if people are willing to thro wgood money at bad then disnet will continue to rape you ,1,2013-02-18
4402,New Disneyland Photo Ticket Process Leading to Long Lines at the Gate,we were very disappointed with our trip to disneyland this time the new multi day ticket picture taking process that was just launched this winter is leading to unbelievable lines just to get in tired and rude staff and patrons and a significant reduction of our time in the park mins a day more when we park hopped lost to lines just to get into the parks while we appreciate the need to stop people from selling sharing their multi day tickets the staff at the gates need to find a better more friendly way to manage the lines and to get people through the process and into the park we lost a lot of time each day to the confusion and poor people management at the gates for example on saturday two monorail trains left in the morning empty as the staff at the downtown disney monorail gates were unable to process tickets take photos and answer the multitude of questions raised the line just stopped moving i have never experienced anything like it at a disney park and we go multiple times each year we hope that they fix this quickly ,1,2013-02-17
4403,DISNEYLAND Eticket UNSAFE AND MISLEADING PLEASE READ!!!!!,i m an annual pass holder with disney i always enjoy disney everything it s so magical disneyland is crowded yes in the summer it s hot yes rides break down yes the food is expensive yes but that s no reason to rank this place terrible you should know all of these things coming into the park it s the single most famous theme park in the world so of course it will be crowded southern california in the summer is hot common knowledge some of the rides there are very sensitive indiana jones for example breaks down often because of how the ride works one thing goes wrong and it responds by shutting down and you have to reset the computer systems get over it ride something else and come back or ask for a fast pass for standing in line while it broke down the disney employees are very helpful and will do almost anything to please their guests oh and yes the food is expensive but you know that the dollar corn dog is the best corn dog you ll ever eat this place is magical and full of hidden secrets it s well worth every penny ,1,2013-02-14
4404,My favorite place in the world!,we are retirees who brought some foreign guests to enjoy the magic of disneyland we always enjoy it especially by arriving a few minutes before opening the first two hours at any park is the least crowded and we get in as much as the rest of the day ,5,2013-02-12
4405,We always enjoy the magic of Disneyland,it s disneyland we actually chose a day that wasn t too busy which was amazing being that it was jan had a great time as always and california adventure with it s new rides is a must ,5,2013-02-12
4406,always magic,had a great time though smaller than disney world we still found some things here that we had not seen in orlando ,5,2013-02-10
4407,Fun at Disney,after going to the walt disney world parks in florida numerous times i decided i really wanted to take a trip to see the original park i am glad that i read up the unofficial guide before going or i might ve missed a lot or been disappointed in what i did do for reasons of expediency i am just going to touch on some highlights specifically from the point of view of someone who was only familiar with the florida parks park hopping is much easier and i feel it is important to get a hopper ticket since both parks in anaheim are physically smaller i don t think i would spend an entire day in just one of the parks but between the two there was plenty to see and do each day it was very nice to exit the one park and only have to walk across the esplanade to get to the other one the castle is smaller like way smaller everyone i know tried to tell me this before going but i still wasn t prepared for the difference it s important to realize that the castle is not the main focal point of disneyland once i got that through my brain i was able to enjoy the park for what it was if you can only go on weekdays we went on a monday wed and fri in january and it was glorious there were no lines the parks weren t crazy crowded and since we d already checked what was going to be down for refurbishment we knew what would or wouldn t be open and were able to plan our trip i would have done mon wed thu but the haunted mansion was reopening on friday which was worth it to us to go on a more crowded day the parks are much more condensed than in orlando so it was much easier on the feet and meant less pushing the stroller around pirates is far and away a much better ride in anaheim don t think you ve seen the ride if you ve only been to wdw out of the rides that are only here and not in one of the florida parks indiana jones is the other one i would rate as must do i d also lump in the matterhorn for historical significance although the ride itself isn t spectacular buzz lightyear is also significantly better because of its better designed guns that are on cords rather than mounted to the vehicle park food is good but expensive most days we walked out to downtown disney and ate at earl of sandwich instead i ll review california adventure separately but will mention that world of color is a must see crowds were so light on monday that we were able to get fast passes for it really easily and didn t go to our section until minutes before the show and were able to see everything fine lines were actually so short that fast passes weren t necessary for most rides if you re there on a slower day i d recommend saving the fast passes for whatever ride you really really want to go on multiple times and get the pass and then go through the regular line first overall i was worried before coming out that everything was going to pale to wdw but happily that wasn t the case there were a few minor negatives that i noticed the standard of service was not the same not that disneyland staff were rude or bad but they also didn t really seem to go out of their way the same as you notice almost immediately in orlando this could also have something to do with the fact that it s off season when the park does get crowded it s not as efficient at dealing with them as wdw this is more the result of wdw having the advantage of being built later and planned out after seeing traffic at disneyland but it s just something to be aware of the ticket entry process was a little bizarre the first day you use your ticket they take your picture i understand that part and then your ticket gets scanned again by the employee at the turnstile every time you go through one of the entrances someone would come over and scan your ticket and then you would then have to go through the turnstile where that employee would scan your ticket it s like the whole process was developed by the disney department of redundancy department these are of course minor quibbles and there is something cool about being able to see the park that walt walked in to anyone who loves wdw but hasn t made the trek out here i would strongly recommend it ,5,2013-02-09
4408,First time visiting from a WDW Diehard,my husband and i just took our daughter her sister and her year old son for his first visit to disneyland and it was a simply perfect experience we decided to go on a weekday in mid january in hopes of avoiding the long lines that always diminish the enjoyment of the experience we arrived before noon and stayed until closing at pm and were able to go on a total of rides during the day and had a lengthy and relaxing lunch at the blue bayou restaurant the lines were minimal minutes or so on average and each ride was a delight for a year old and his mom aunt and grandparents we hadn t been to disneyland for a decade or so and we were impressed with how many of the rides had improved over the years our decision to visit disneyland on a weekday in winter in order to avoid huge crowds was critical to the success of our visit especially with a young child with limited endurance for long waits for us disneyland last wednesday was indeed the happiest place on earth ,4,2013-01-24
4409,Disneyland Visit on a Wednesday in January,after a week at disney world in december my teen daughter and i had a quick weekend trip to disneyland there is just no comparison to the original disneyland is in a class by itself it s our home away from home the park was spotless cast members were pleasant and the weather was spectacular a beautiful weekend ,5,2013-01-23
4410,Great for young and old,disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth there is lots to do for people of all ages even if you are not into rides there is still a lot to see and do within disneyland fantasmic and the fireworks are a must ,5,2013-01-19
4411,Will remind you to be a child again,this place is everything that you have dreamed of so many attractive rides shows your favourite characters coming to see you it s truly the place where dreams come alive even though you pay a steep price for it what i liked apart from the usual things is that the restrooms were clean the disney merchandise stores were so many had so much variety it was a happy place was a good place to spend my holidays ,5,2013-01-18
4412,Not good to go on weekends,we loved autopia indiana jones space mountain splash mountain and pirates of the caribbean we enjoyed the haunted mansion big thunder mountain and the jungle cruise we could have done without buzz lightyear star tours and matterhorn bobsleds we queued mins for the finding nemo submarine voyage to be told there were technical difficulties and the ride would be closed until further notice we were quite disappointed i can t imagine how those at the front of the queue who waited an hour felt like the ride was closed for the rest of the day we spent most of the day queueing granted we did go during the winter holiday but waiting to mins for mins rides was frustrating some rides were also randomly closed for a few hours and then reopened as a result we didn t cover the totality of the park i would suggest doing the rides you really like during the parade queues are minimal at that time we found it hard to circulate in the park because of an excess amount of mobility scooters please note that i m not talking about wheelchairs or pushchairs obviously we do not discriminate and don t think anyone should be excluded from having fun i won t go into the details of what we heard but i will say that the scooters should be for those with health issues and not for pure enjoyment the one thing that really surprised us is how tiny the castle is we live in paris and have been to euro disneyland many times and the castle is huge in comparison how funny buy your tickets online and arrive early ,2,2013-01-18
4413,Fun but exhausting day,i had a very unpleasant experience while i was visiting disneyland resort anaheim on december yes it was new year s eve and it was at around pm when i was trying to catch the new year s countdown and fireworks at disneyland from pm pm i was in california adventure park to see the world of color show i would like to share my experience with you and hope there will be an improvement on disneyland s procedure for multi day passes i had a day park hopper ticket and was re entering disneyland park i presented my ticket and my photo id to the lady named isabella if i remember correctly she was looking at my ticket and questioning me why the ink was not dark i said i did not do anything to make the ink fade in fact i used the pen provided by disneyland to write down my name on the ticket on the first day of my visit after that i just kept using my ticket the ink was fading by itself nothing i could do about it she insisted on saying that the pen was the permanent mark the ink should not fade at all i said if the ink was fading then the pen was really not a permanent mark she asked me to step aside saying someone would check my ticket i had no choice but to follow the order however i never expected i would wait for more than minutes it felt like forever to get my ticket back i was in a hurry to join the crowd for the countdown and fireworks but the disneyland lady and her lead seemed not caring about it at all they took their time and did not even bother to care my concerns i asked the lady when i could get my ticket back and why it took so long to check the ticket she simply answered my lead had your ticket with very arrogant cold and careless atitude and no explanation on why it took so long i said anxiously that i needed to catch the fireworks but she did not care at all all my family members got in with their tickets but they had to wait for me they really did not understand what was wrong with my ticket my name was still there just the ink was light there was no sign on misusing of the ticket finally after a long time her lead robert came back and gave the ticket back to me isabella used a pen to put the new ink on my name i asked robert why it took so long to check my ticket again he simply said oh i needed to validate your ticket okay you could validate my ticket but with the world class disneyland park it took more than minutes to validate a ticket and i was blocked at the door for almost minutes in total from the beginning to the end there were no apologies from disneyland staff at all i was so frustrated and upset my whole family went to the city hall and spoke to the management we brought up our concerns seriously while we were in the city hall we missed the countdown plus the beginning of the fireworks we rushed to the outside and watched the fireworks from a not so good view point my dad missed the whole fireworks since he continued discussing our concerns with the manager the incident totally ruined our new year s eve celebration at disneyland which was the most important part of our visit and i just do not understand why i should be punished while it was not my fault at all if anything was wrong it was the pen the pen was provided by the disneyland park i had nothing to do with it because of the poor permanent mark it wasted my and my family members precious minutes on new year s eve plus the time to report our concerns i visited disneyland la two times in with my day and day tickets i enjoyed my visits and felt the disneyland staff was so friendly and well trained but the experience i had in destroyed my good impression on disneyland completely we already felt a lot of inconvenience of showing both the tickets and the id s in and then on top of it a lot of suspicions and distrust i paid for my ticket and i did not think i should be treated like that way i really feel a new solution should be come up to respond to this situation i saw some other guests with the valid tickets were blocked at the entrance too to me that experience is the ultimate insult and humiliation i always use valid tickets and with the tickets i was never ever blocked at the door anywhere else except disneyland we were coming for the happiness but not for the distrustfulness the interesting thing was after that lady rewrote my name on the ticket using the pen a couple of days later the ink faded again i still have my ticket with the faded ink disneyland did not have a good procedure for the multi day tickets the current procedure is not working the pen was not actually a permanent mark therefore disneyland should take the consequence but not me not the guests ,3,2013-01-17
4414,"An Unpleasant Experience at Disneyland Resort, Anaheim, on December 31, 2012",i love disneyland and minnies breakfast place is great and the money was well worth it and the food is great a big variety but every time we are there at least to ride break down i pay to be happy and after the lines we are not very happy they need to give vouchers to return ,2,2013-01-15
4415,Broke down Disney,it was fairly busy when we went it seems the first week in january is still considered holiday season and it everyone was there to celebrate however we managed to still enjoy the park by using the fastpass system and going early in the morning taking a break in the middle of the day when it got crowded and then coming back later in the evening night we had magic morning one day meaning you can come into the park an hour before it officially opens and that was fantastic the crowds were tiny then not all the rides are open during magic morning but we were able to ride on nearly all the rides that were open with very little wait i strongly suggest taking the time to utilize the fastpass system if you go during a crowded time it is wonderful to be able to get on a ride with a minute wait when the line is currently or minutes long don t miss the shows or the fireworks note some of the best shows are the little ones that just creep up on you we had sat down on a bench near the main street train station to peel a couple oranges and happened to see the daper dans show up for a flag retirement ceremony complete with the pledge of allegiance and some patriotic songs it was quite touching and i was impressed with how wonderful their voices were fantasmic was good and the kids loved the fireworks over the castle ,4,2013-01-13
4416,We loved it despite the crowds.,lines were long crowded walkways and some rides didn t work i actually kicked a baby stroller and made the baby cry because the couple were hurrying to their destination it was an accident but i really felt bad my daughter got run over by a old lady in a electric cart and my other daughter had her foot ran over with no apology by the old man ,4,2013-01-10
4417,never during the holidays!!,disneyland is no match to the superior disney world in florida but it is a fantastic place for families although more than one day is needed to see everything in disney world disneyland can easily be seen in one day with proper planning i would recommend arriving right before the park opens and bring a park map with you in order to plan your route for the day locate which rides offer fast passes and collect them along the way plan on staying late to see a fireworks show too finnicky teenagers may not like disneyland but the california adventure other disney park would be a good alternative the entrances of both parks disneyland and california adventure are located right by each other within feet so it would be easy for a large group to split up for the day and meet by the entrances at the end strollers are available with stroller parking located all over the park ,1,2013-01-09
4418,Second happiest place on Earth,our family decided to return to the parks for one day on january th after spending days here in the summer it was insanely busy we went back and forth between the parks and managed to ride all of the rides the kids wanted except for one that included radiator springs in carsland we also had time for the parade in disneyland the fireworks and some general walking around and seeing the sights some tips for the day arrive when the park opens know what you are planning to do so you don t waste time standing around use the fast passes until they run out send one person to the other park in the morning to collect fast passes for when you head over in the afternoon and think ahead of how you are going to keep your kids occupied while in the line ups i know we ate while sitting and waiting for the parade to start and snacked while in a one hour line up for a ride use your time well disney is a great way to spend the day staff is wonderful ,5,2013-01-09
4419,Very Expensive for what you get,we all know that disney is expensive but when you have to stand inline for an hour for a minute rise it is simply not acceptable we were there between christmas and new year and as of am is was near impossible to get into a ride the park was saturated disney should limit the amount of people they admit into the park so that it would be a magical moment for the people in the park with hotels a three day admission for we spent in excess of hind sight being i will spend this money at other attractions ,3,2013-01-06
4420,Never gets old,extremely overcrowded the wait for most rides was between to minutes main street was cordoned off for parades and other events so everyone had to use the sidewalks only it was shoulder to shoulder crowded and everyone was being directed on where to walk by the cast members who were all wonderful under the circumstances we were even directed to walk behind the main street buildings this was a first for us i paid for my park hopper tickets each in advance online it s very disappointing that management would allow so many people into the park creating such overcrowding that my daughter and i had a terrible time at p m we got our first fast pass tickets for star tours which gave us a return time of a m we couldn t get fast pass tickets for another two hours even going through the fast pass line for the haunted mansion we stood in line for minutes for the star tours fast pass at a m we stood in line outside in degree weather for minutes patio heaters would have been helpful the lines for food were very long after purchasing our food we could not find seating inside so had to try to find a table outside it was cold that day so by the time a table was available our hot food was now cold and of course the food was expensive no patio heaters outdoors either the lines were just as long at the california adventures park we ve been to disneyland quite a few times before but this was the worst time we ever had there this was not a happy time and my daughter and i have no desire to return i left with the feeling that disney was only interested in money not providing a fun and happy time ,5,2013-01-05
4421,New Year's Eve 2012,we visited disneyland park on december and while we were prepared to brave the crowds since it is the holiday season after all we did not expect to see the park that packed when you get into the parking lot the cashier asked us if we already had tickets which we had already purchased online he let us in after paying the fee and handed us a green ticket that stated that disneyland park was busy so they were not letting in people anymore i guess that is disney s way of lifting off their liabilities we had the day one park per day package and were visiting la with a year old so it is not like we had the luxury of coming back another day where it was less busy we were still able to get in despite the extreme business it was packed so packed that you could barely see the grounds i felt unsafe to get around and was holding my daughter s hands the whole time we tried to get by during the parade so we could do some ride impossible average wait time was minutes for each ride we only managed to do rides in between the parade in the hours we were there food is awful and extremely expensive for the worst hamburgers we ever had and a mini pizza which was more dough than pizza and drinks that is extreme we also had to line up for that minutes and line up for the washrooms it was a big disappointment for us and anything but magical they take so much money yet make it impossible to experience more that rides per visit that is over per ride a rip off if you ask me i don t know if there is ever a slow time avoid if you can ,1,2013-01-04
4422,Get ready to line up for everything,do not go during the holidays they let people in every day and just makes things too difficult lines for the bathroom lines for food lines for everything ,2,2013-01-03
4423,Disneyland Christmas,we paid for our family of to get in it was so crowded we road rides we were there from am pm over hr wait for every ride i will never go again,3,2013-01-03
4424,Save your money,disney was max out no room to move what so ever only got in a few rides in over hours lineups were to hours for rides not worth my i spent to get in xmas holidays and over selling tickets are to blame shame on disney for thinking of the money first not the happiest place on earth anymore ,1,2013-01-03
4425,Crowed 2 hour ride lineups,there is no doubt that the folks at disney had put a lot of attention to detail and a ton of money into this park and the overall feeling all around is that everything is well designed and executed there is an evident attention to details in how the rides look the different park areas the lighting the shops costumes restaurants and practically everything you really don t feel that anything is fake or that money was saved at any point on the contrary the feeling is that everything was done so this place would look the best possible and that money was not an option however this comes at a cost tickets are expensive so you definitely feel that you are paying for this high quality even a bit too much but that could have been ok if the lines weren t so long for practically everything in the park i mean there is barely any ride that you can just casually go onto as an afterthought lines to all major rides for us were between minutes for the relatively less popular rides to minutes and some went up to and even minutes yes that s over hours for a single ride this means that you need to carefully plan your stay so you get to see and do everything you wanted to with kids there only so much time you can spend before they need a break so practically with food and everything you will be able to enjoy rides a day max i do use the term enjoy because once you are on a ride it s fun all the rides i ve been on were great even the ones for little kids i heard that disney world in orlando is less crowded i hope so because i can t really fully recommend disneyland because of the long lines and the fact that it is crowded also food in the park and in downtown disney the area outside the park entrance makes food at airport look like a great deal it s in average twice what you would pay for similar food anywhere else and lines are long for that too ,1,2013-01-01
4426,Fun for little kids,this was probably the biggest disappointment of our trip the place was so crowded you couldn t even walk we have been to disney world three or four times and never had crowds and waits like this we were there for hours and were only able to ride six rides and see one show the whole fast pass idea is a flop the radiator springs fast passes were gone before am i think it s time disney made some changes we would have gladly paid the extra for a real fast pass like six flags offers i will say that the christmas decor was magnificent could not see the parades due to the crowds even the line to the haunted mansion was bad too crowded and too expensive for what little we got to do won t return ,5,2012-12-31
4427,Loved it! So much fun!,pure magic even long lines and long walks don t take away from the experience our sons had a fabulous time and we enjoyed the shows parades shopping and food there s something for everyone to enjoy nomatter how old or young we hope your disneyland vacation is as wonderful as ours was ,5,2012-12-28
4428,Christmas Day at Disneyland,it was really beautifully decorated but so crowded even though the park was open from morning until midnight and using the fastpass system we didn t get on the rides we normally do any other time of year if you re not into the rides but like shopping or eating instead then the holidays are right for you also be prepared for hordes of strollers i m not sure what infants get out of disneyland but parents bring them and are aggressive so wear sneakers rather than flip flops of cute shoes that will likely get run over scuffed or run into on christmas day there were showings of the main street parade and of the fantasmic light show the haunted mansion was re done inside and out along with a special narrative theme during the ride to reflect the nightmare before christmas really amazing of course the most spectacular sight is sleeping beauty s castle all covered in lights i won t do christmas day again but to do once in a life yeah it was something to see ,5,2012-12-27
4429,Disneyland not just for little kids,we are in our s and i ve been twice and just as much fun now as it was then much quicker to get around make sure you get the fastpass for the popular attractions from machines near each attraction map will tell you if fp available just be aware you can only have one at a time so plan well you can get your next fp just before your next one is ready to be used saves queuing so well worth a bit of planning first ,5,2012-12-27
4430,For people in their twenties,three of us all in the their early twenties went to disneyland park on december we did a road trip from sfo and took the pch to enjoy the scenic beauty and trust me it was the best we had ever seen disneyland was awesome yes awesome is the word we had just one day at our disposal but we made full use of the time we were inside the park at am and came out at pm i would like to mention the following points for youngsters planning to visit disneyland with their friends get some sleep the previous night or you are going to get tired very soon the park is huge there is a concept of fast pass which allows you to take one fast pass for a ride and return to it at a specified time without having to stand in the queue make full use of this it will save you lots of time for the most popular rides which could have a waiting time of upto hour we liked space mountain the most in fact we did it twice indiana jones and space mountain are two of the best rides apart from the them pirates of the caribbean and finding nemo are great too for indians do not get deterred by reviews which warn you of long queues we are used to longer queues in amusement parks in india with more jostling and noise in the evening you are bound to feel tired if you have taken most of the rides in the morning and afternoon so to relax yourself you could take the boat ride and cruise they will take away all your exhaustion while you enjoy the wonders of disneyland christmas is the best time to visit with the resplendent colors and christmas themed rides the parade and fireworks are simply out of the world ,5,2012-12-27
4431,Great Family Day..but...,we decied to go to disneyland on december nd it was packed i think the decorations and the park itself was made over really nice with the holiday decorations but we won t be going back during this crazy time period we drove from the local hotel to the disney parking lot we were transported from the parking lot via disney tram to the facility it took us about minutes to gain entry into the park most rides had very long rides we only rode about rides during the hours that we were there on site the pm christmas parade and pm fireworks were nice tip you can bring your own food drink into the park we brought a backpack with snacks that we ate while we were in line that the kids really enjoyed i would highly recommend doing this in order to avoid the corn dog no choke and other high priced items ,4,2012-12-23
4432,December: Right time of year to go,after hrs of travelling from australia we were aprehensive of hitting disneyland right off the bat thinking the crowds would be too much for our family and kids but we were pleasantly surprised we got to disneyland at about am on a saturday december th and there was about mins wait to collect our tickets from the gate and then about mins line up to enter the park make sure you take your i d if you have multi day passes once inside the most popular rides were about mins wait on saturday and sunday all others including splash mountain were max mins tips i would suggest going on a week day in the first or second week of december use magic morning passes and go straight to cars radiator racers in california adventures grab your fast pass near bugs land and then go straight to the ride for about mins wait the use your fast pass for the ride again anyone who likes the movie will love this ride also those who like to go fast bring sandwiches and eat them in line the food is ok at the parks slightly better at dca but quite on the expensive side search the stores outside of the park for reasonably priced t shirts rather than the stores inside search for private accommodation on vrbo failing that the ramada plaza has free buffet breakfast and comfortable beds the staff at disneyland were brilliant very friendly and helpful and the park itself was immaculately clean young or old there is plenty to see and do many random activities in the streets and many christmas parades i can t wait to go back,5,2012-12-19
4433,"Disneyland Dec. 15, 2012",we liked all of the christmas decorations we did not like the long lines some up to hours we thought prior to christmas the park might have less attendees the park was packed with lines for everything we had teens so we could stay till late but we felt sorry for those that had little ones the lines were so long that it made it impossible to really get a lot in on our visit for just one day yes we did use the fast pass system but they don t tell you that the passes can also run out once too many are given out and yes we paid the high one day rate as there were no discounts to be found please disneyland limit the amount of people you allow into the park it was so packed it made the experience unpleasant ,4,2012-12-17
4434,Not what it used to be,first big read expensive with air hotel transportation trip with the family wife kids and me we chose disneyland in december when we could have gone anywhere k can take you for days the last time my wife and i were there was in no dca at that time just the main attraction and i don t remember ever having to wait in an august line for more than minutes for any attraction there is ample evidence that there are more theme parks in the socal area disney talent is extremely uneven and inconsistent we had one fabulous cast member who answered our questions the way we remember disney doing it in enthusiastic cheerful knowledgeable authentic etc to some who either didn t know where some attractions were and didn t know who to send us to what s clear is that the park is wayyyyyyyy beyond capacity and in december safety has to be a major concern i have some familiarity with disaster planning and if the masses ever got out of control in that park it would be chaos it took us three tries and finally an hour staking out a spot to see a parade and fantasmic the only reason world of color could be seen was because of the fastpass fastpass is clearly an admission that the park is over capacity the radiator springs race ride in dca was a nightmare the fastpass was gone within the first hour of opening and then the minute wait without the fp was ridiculous i m not going to go over every area of the park because you have to expect crowds at disneyland but this is so much different from in we didn t have kids to feed the kids meal is okay for kids under over and you re paying and up for everyone else before beverage the food is somewhere between mcdonalds and red robin quality unless you re in a restaurant we avoided the restaurants because for the five of us we d spend an average of per meal blue bayou ariel s grotto etc we did enjoy those restaurants but mac n cheese was about all that our kids would eat there would we go there again i don t know even though it is disneyland that it s not the same is clear it is definitely corporate rather than family owned having accountants run any business involving people is a bad idea and it really shows personal touches are far and few and the goal to soak is clear risking people s safety and diminishing their experience by exceeding capacity and overcharging for lower quality food and customer service is really unfortunate and not the disney i visited as a kid or later as an adult i don t think the disney magic has the same cache to the board in the end if it s less magical for the kids then it s less likely that they ll want to return as adults and will choose to spend their k somewhere else ,3,2012-12-17
4435,Turkey legs,on the morning of nov th we came to disneyland for our early morning entry to the park we stood in line for ten minutes and were making headway to the front only to find out that the line for the day park hopper passes was on the complete opposite side so off we went into a much longer and slower moving line the lady working the computer on entry did not have a clue what she was supposed to do and was so slow entering the data we missed our early entry thank you everyone around us was angry and frustrated why could you not have put clear visible signage for entry on the various gates it is hard to see small printing from just about the entrance to california land to disneyland which is where our line started after moving we got into the park at after waiting in two lines for about an hour it certainly was not the happiest place on earth when you have young children with you it is hard to make them understand just how disorganized you are ,3,2012-11-28
4436,Too many rides were closed!,there were at least three or four rides closed to include it s a small world and the indiana jones ride the peter pan ride you can hardly see the city lights below now is london having a brown out part of the time they were filming a movie and the whole fantasyland part of the park was closed when you pay a day this seems unreasonable also bring back the swiss family robinson tree and jettison tarzan sometimes the old is better and if it wasn t broke why mess with it as for captain e o that felt very dated and kind of creepy ,4,2012-11-14
4437,"The one, the only",some people think there are many disneylands they are wrong there is only one the rest are wax museum copies of the classic original which only gets better over time the admission price is fairly ridiculous as is the annual pass cost but our family bites the bullet every year we try and get to the park at least or times a year when its crowded go to the shows people watch go on the lesser rides and avoid the popular attractions when its not crowded like first thing in the morning and off days go on the fast exciting rides enjoy the architecture take a close look at the buildings in tomorrowland in fantasyland everywhere it s spectacular still the greatest place on earth and even though i ve been there over a hundred times i still look forward to my trip every time ,5,2012-11-12
4438,Fun Time,we rode many of the same attractions here that we did in disney world what we found interesting was that even though it was the same pirates or jungle cruise ride the layout and presentation was different enough to be a new experience,5,2012-11-08
4439,Disneyland in October,took advantage of the haunted tour three hours of amusing tour guide interactions and front of the line privelages to five of the two parks most popular rides ,5,2012-11-05
4440,Disney Trip 2012,my husband and i decided to make a trip to disneyland october to check out the new updated attractions since our last trip to the park was in we thought october would be a great time to avoid crowds boy were we wrong the crowds were horrible even with fast pass the crowds frustrated both my husband and i we enjoyed the revised star tours but did not like the halloween themed space mountain or the haunted mansion it seemed many of the rides kept breaking down while we were there i e space mountain matterhorn i was very disappointed that the indy ride was closed and the current condition of it s a small world that ride needs an overhaul overall my husband and i enjoyed the fireworks ,3,2012-11-02
4441,Disneyland 3 Day Hopper Pass,you need as least days to experience everyting in both parks we had full days from morning to closing and still missed a few things you need to use your fast pass regularly to save time and as cars land is new it is really busy make sure you line up for a fastpass for the cars racing ride first up as this ride is the busiest and fast passes will sell out by early afternoon we found the food at the park reasonably priced and bought lunch or dinner there rather than wasing time to leave and come back make sure you see all of the night shows fireworks world of color and mickey mouse vs the evil queen they are spectacular and i think the best attractions at both the parks you can get a fastpass for the world of color which will ensure you get a good viewing spot otherwise people start waiting in good viewing spots a hrs prior ,5,2012-10-31
4442,"Magical, Great Holiday Theming",i have been going to disneyland the last week of september for many years and it just gets better every year especially the halloween theming haunted mansion holiday and space mountain ghost galaxy are great and i dare say more enjoyable than their non holiday counterparts we try to do something new each year the happiest haunts tour last time and this time we spent more time exploring the area around the big thunder ranch there are animals for the children to interact with but the neatest find was the barn filled with scarecrow pumpkins we had the whole place to ourselves to pose and take pictures and then suddenly woody appeared from nowhere it was a nice memory of the time when character sightings were alway spontaneous instead of the scheduled line em up meet and greets the character interaction is so much better when there is no pre formed line just around the corner there is a stage with holiday performers and a wonderful display of intricate pumpkin carvings outside the villians tent fantasyland is a joy as always since it still has the traditional dark rides that are going extinct in florida i did find the matterhorn to be very painful this time around and could only sit through it once and then i was bruised and sore the rest of the trip they need to swap out those cars for some with more padding or that can ride the rails more smoothly be sure to check the disney website for ride refurbishments so you can plan accordingly if a ride is going to close during your stay also any food location that serves fountain drinks has cups of water you can request free of charge same size cup as a regular soda also the denny s across the street by the non disney hotels sells the regular size dasani water bottles for cents if you want a bottle to carry around with you ,5,2012-10-24
4443,Fabulous time!,my husband i were not looking forward to our recent trip to disneyland with our y o daughter as it didn t like much of a vacation but boy were we wrong from the moment we walked through the gates we were instantly caught up in the magic of it all even decided to stay an extra day at the park everything is just so beautiful fun and the serivce you receive from every single staff member you interact with is top notch we were pleasantly surprised at all variety of food options available it wasn t too hard to find something healthy even for snacks our only suggestion would be to not visit during the halloween season as the park closes early for an halloween party which is an additional fee the park gets very busy during the last few hours as all the party go ers are allowed in early ,5,2012-10-23
4444,Disney Land Dismay,how can anyone enjoy a day out in overcrowded parks where lines a hours long the parks themselves are good to visit but highly overcrowded value for money no way this is disney at its worst greedy suggest that european visitors go to disney world florida and save themselves the hassle of a long flight across the usa ,2,2012-10-20
4445,THE ORIGINAL ALWAYS SURPASSES THE SEQUEL...,the world disneyland is great but disneyland is greater the time is not a problem when visiting disneyland and if you have an extra day then the california theme park next door has all the exciting ride to enjoy the original disneyland definitely surpasses the sequel disneyworld etc ,5,2012-10-18
4446,Halloween party and Disney fun,we attended the halloween party for the second time the party starts at but ticket holders can come in hours early kids love the trick or treat trails the best part is hardly having a wait time at the rides walked on almost everything the halloween fireworks were beautiful but viewing for the fireworks seemed limited facing the castle try to go on the right side we were on the left and the talking head was behind the castle we went back for a second full day but it seemed like overkill yes we would have missed some things but it would have given us more to see next time love that the park is always so clean without garbage spilling out of the cans ,4,2012-10-18
4447,Gluten intolerant need not fear eating here!,i took my five year old daughter on her first trip to disneyland with our extended family this past weekend she and her little cousins were in awe the whole time i d recommend starting your trip on a sunday that way you can get a chance to see the amazing firework show in the evening but be able to miss the crowds fast passes are definitely the way to go in order to avoid waiting in long lines as is the single rider option usually less than a five minute wait if only a few of you want to go on a particular ride getting there early is also always a must as is bringing or renting a small stroller if you have younger children and if you want a good view during the parade be prepared to save your party a spot on the curb early if you bring a backpack being able to bring your own food in is also convenient if you want to stick to a budget or have picky eaters but disneyland really does have something for everyone and is even accommodating for those with allergies or a gluten intolerance overall the place is truly magical for the young and old ,5,2012-10-17
4448,Sunday Visit,crowds are less on sunday mornings and park seems more peaceful you can get in a lot more rides if you arrive when the park opens would recommend hitting fantasyland rides on a sunday morning before the crowds hit in the afternoon ,5,2012-10-15
4449,All that I imagined it would be,first off a piece of advice if you plan to go to disneyland go on a weekday if you do you have easier parking shorter lines sometimes no lines a better experience overall i liked that disney is always attempting to update some of the attractions including the use of some modern technologies everything was worth the wait which except for attractions was pretty short favorites for attractions were pirates of the caribbean big thunder mountain railroad splash mountain matterhorn bobsleds space mountain and star tours have fun ,5,2012-10-05
4450,Thanks to the Disneyland carpark guys,after a very long very hot very exhausting but fun day at disneyland with our year old twins we managed to accidentally drive off leaving our toy story dolls woody and buzz on the car rooftop alas the toys fell off the roof and were run over on the disneyland exit road so we had to return to the carpark where attendant michael i m fairly sure that was his name and his team allowed us to park close to the trolley so we could return to the disneyland park groan to get replacements of woody and buzz the carpark guys also managed to get us a voucher so we could replace the dolls for free and it was great not to have to pay for the toys again then mission accomplished as we were driving back to la it transpired the replacement buzz was not working groan so we had to return to the disneyland carpark for a third time that day this time we were ushered right to the very front of the carpark and we finally collected new dolls again that were all in working order it was a scenario not dissimilar to a toy story movie plot i have to say it was the carpark guys who stopped us parents from going completely crazy many thanks to the unsung heroes of the disneyland park the parking team ,5,2012-10-05
4451,"Did not disappoint , love the attention to detail",we are from aus and got the day pass what great value it is expedia com au the attention to detail in this place is amazing the rides are good though perhaps not enough of them to thrill you but the fast pass system works very well and saves a lot of time in lines it s also free so use it to your advantage this forum has great tips on how to use it fantasmic and the fireworks are fantastic and worth waiting for the cast members are all happy and cheerful and the place is spotless favorite rides would have been star tours different versions though we saw just the splash mountain space mountain matterhorn bobsleds and autopia shame that indiana jones was closed though recommend doing halloween on a tuesday night as the lines are shorter ,5,2012-10-03
4452,We can't get enough of DL,every time we end our vacation from here we say we are going somewhere else next time but within a month we always have a desire to return to dl our kids are and and they all love this place we go the end of august and there are barely any lines we love space mountain and the bid thunder railroad ,4,2012-10-03
4453,First visit - this place is exceptional,our first day in disneyland was fantastic clean great service including extraordinary concern and action with respect to our daughter s allergies from brittany at the world of color picnics no wait more than minutes on a tuesday in october clean and plentiful rest rooms and plentiful water bubblers despite website advice that you cannot carry food it was obvious that many people did which could save quite a bit of money highly recommended ,5,2012-10-03
4454,Funnest time ever,i love disneyland so much and i had a blast i would go anytime any day i would say disneyland is fun for all ages babies to grandparents you are never to young or old for some magic my favorite ride is splash mountain you do get wet but it has a whole inside part plus i also really like space mountain it is a fast roller coaster and it actually seems like you are in outer space it s so cool disneyland also has big parades and shows one really great show is fantasia it is a bit load but the show is wonderful i would also recommend thunder mountain though for the matterhorn i would recommend to go on it if you have no injuries it s really fun but jerky plus if you want a good scare the yeti gets me and if you want a sit back and relax in air condition ride i would go strait to it s a small world ,5,2012-10-01
4455,Great experience,yes it was worth travelling km for our kids loved every minute of our time at disney and so did we our favourites were the star tours and the splash mountain don t miss the evening show either interesting to look at small world to see just how far the park has come in years the only reason we didn t give stars was that rides were closed which we thought seemed a bit excessive ,4,2012-09-30
4456,Overrated,don t know what promos or such disney has going but this year has been off the charts busy even on days its not supposed to be ,1,2012-09-25
4457,Too Crowded,i went to a wedding in the area therefore we decided to spend a day using the park hopper to visit disneyland and california adventure i do highly recommend getting the park hopper to visit both parks in day and was well worth it we visited middle in the summer so crowds were crazy however what i learned is invaluable you can get what they call fastpass lines at disney world can reach and hours long instead of standing in line now you can just grab a ticket with a return time on it and you get to go right to the almost front of the line the lesson i learned here is that they run out and you can only get one every hour you scan your entry ticket and that is how they keep track so don t lose your entry ticket so i would suggest planning your day just a little and try to get the most popular ride first before they run out of the fastpass then throughout the day pick up a few more and here is my favorite part about half the lines have singles lines the wait for these are about half if not less than the regular line however you ride as a single person filling up the empty seats as needed we honestly did not care we had so much fun talking in line that by the time we got on the ride which only lasts a few minutes it did not matter who was sitting next to us we knocked out about of the disneyland park californian adventure by doing this plus we were lazy and did not start the day till about am don t forget to watch the world of color light show at california adventure amazing you can also get tickets for better viewing not sure how as we just stood in the back and had no issues hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did ,2,2012-09-24
4458,Disneyland for Group of Adults,try to go to park tuesday thursday not as crowded we didn t wait more than mins for any of the rides ,5,2012-09-24
4459,always amazing.,three e ticket attractions closed on the same day simply isn t acceptable i love disneyland even better than disney world but it kind of feels like if you re not an annual pass holder you aren t important wdw would never make you feel like this and cater for the once in a lifetimer i m fortunate enough to know i will visit dl again but it might not be for years or so we travelled from england for my th birthday all i wanted was to go to dl thursday the th of september as our day to visit only to find space mountain and the haunted mansion were closed for halloween make overs presumably so they could make and extra buck off of the annual pass holders and screw the once in a lifetimers and indianna jones was closed for refurbishment etickets closed did i get a discount no was i warned when buying my tickets no was i compensated in anyway no i found out on the gate when it was too late simply not good enough disney simply not good enough tda normally puts tdo to shame but they let me and every other guest that day down turning disneyland into a half day park ,5,2012-09-23
4460,Don't visit in September,disney land is extremely magical i love taking my kids to disneyland it is very expensive try and take food with you especially bottles of water love disneyland ,3,2012-09-22
4461,Its Disney!!,just a wonderful place to take the family always fun always something new to look forward to food is good all cast members are friendly get there early we are always at the front of the gate before opening we get a least an hour to hit all all the rides with no line it s awesome ,5,2012-09-21
4462,We visit 5+ times a year,i love disneyland as much as the next person and have visited a few times over the year but i must caution people to not make the same mistake as us and visit over a holiday it was so absolutely crowded that it made it a miserable experience long lines long waits no room to move i think it is unfair to crowd people in like that ,5,2012-09-20
4463,Fun fun fun!,just got home from a long weekend in anaheim have been to disney several times but this was not one of my favorite trips several rides in the park are closed for refurbishment indiana jones haunted mansion and a large part of fantasyland these are my two favorite rides city hall is also under reconstruction which means giant tarps over the facade they moved the bakery with the heavenly cinnamon rolls it just isn t the same the heat made everyone cranky and short tempered including cast members i would feel bad for anyone visiting for the first time not the magical disneyland experience we ve come to expect on a brighter note california adventure was awesome ,5,2012-09-19
4464,Be smart & save money,i just have a few tips for families visiting disneyland while watching the prices inflate year after year it has really discouraged me from making any purchases at the park itself we simply stop by the local cvs store the day before we go and let each child pick out three souvenirs gifts then we have them pick out post cards for grandma grandpa and their friends now everyone is decked out in their disney apparel and ready to enjoy the park we only spend about forty dollars on souvenirs gifts and it s the same items you would buy at the park i also suggest packing a backpack with small snacks band aids hand sanitizer a few water bottles and a blanket yes a blanket why it gets cold in california at night and it will come in handy while watching the parade with your kiddos don t rush your kids through the park let them enjoy seeing everything us as adults take for granted have fun ,5,2012-09-08
4465,Have to Visit,the original disneyland park is a must visit at least once or even more as a young couple with no kids we had a great time enjoying the magic of disney i had been about years ago and was very similar to how i remembered it this is good and bad and perhaps would have been nice if they had enhanced the park much more than they had were only a handful of new rides where i would have expected much more of an overhaul was pretty busy which is to be expected and can be some long lines to wait for rides the best tip is to arrive at park opening am and head around to all the popular rides straight away splash mountain indiana jones roger rabbit space mountain star wars etc and you ll have pretty much no wait that then leaves the rest of the day to take it easy and enjoy the rest of the park and less busy rides also make good use of the fast pass system will save lots of waiting we managed to see the park in a single day am until after the light show finishing about pm was a long day but managed it even heading out of the park for a couple of hours for dinner probably with children you will need at least days to get around the whole park and see and do most things being a theme park everything is of course designed to get you to spend money on food clothes gifts etc some of these were reasonably priced and others a bit expensive you are allowed to bring your own food into the park so consider bringing some bottles of water and perhaps lunch snacks to save a few ,4,2012-09-07
4466,"Enjoyable experience at Disneyland, anaheim",we were on a day trip to la friends who had been there earlier advised us to avoid the weekend crowd so we decided to visit the disney parks during weekdays being there early we were able to avoid the queues and finish most of the rides before lunch mickey s parade was awesome we had planned the tour around the park before visiting so we didn t waste much time searching for attractions what we didn t expect was the heat carry lot of water drinks it would be nice if the park management could do something to make the heat bearable as with any amusement park everything inside is really expensive if possible buy your lunch outside it is a huge park with lot of walking to do wear comfortable shoes strollers are available for rent if possible take your own to save a few bucks when travelling with young children being an early bird has its own advantage even though our son napped for about an hour we still had enough time leaving the park after the fireworks was difficult because of the huge crowd tips stay close to the park and be as early as possible wear comfortable clothing be ready to face the heat use the online map to plan your visit and save time make use of the fastpass facility ,5,2012-09-04
4467,If your only ever go to Disney once go to Florida,great visit to disneyland and calif adventure surprisingly not overly crowded on labor day weekend especially friday ,3,2012-09-04
4468,Disney never disappoints!,yes the crowds can be horrendous but what a magic place this is rides are great and yes the lines can be a put off but at certain times we waited less than minutes to get on rides such as thunder mountain and pirates of the caribbean oh and if you are hungry try one of the smoked turkey legs they are a great meal ,5,2012-09-04
4469,Magic,disneyland doesn t fail to please especially if you spend time before you go preplanning your day one improvement disney could make is to provide more shade in all queuing areas especially out the front where people queue at the beginning of the day to wait to get in make sure you wear hats sunscreen or even take an umbrella to protect you while you are in queues or waiting to see the parade take a bottle of water you can refill it from the drinking fountains i have been to disneyworld florida and tokyo disney and there is a consistent excellence in the appearance service and quality of the disney theme parks this time round i used an online planning service called ridemax to help me organise my day for it was worth it it took the worry out of trying to figure out the best way to fit everything in there is a single rider queuing option for some of the more popular rides at disneyland definitely use this if you are by yourself or if you don t really need to ride with your companions you can all queue together but ride separately the single rider queue is often much faster than the fast pass queue it is worth trying to get fast passes as often as possible but don t be too concerned about getting to the ride inside the time window shown i found that you could pretty much use the fast pass anytime after the start of the time period shown even hours later plan to have your lunch which you can bring with you while you watch the billy hill and the hillbillies show there are tables and the show is excellent get to disneyland at least half an hour before the opening time so you don t waste time queuing at the beginning plan to stay until after the fireworks at night the fireworks show is truly amazing and is best viewed from the main street area in front of the castle it is worth saving a spot at least or minutes before the fireworks so that you can get a good view maybe plan to eat some dinner there while you are waiting it s nice to see that disneyland is providing healthier food options these days with trays of cut fruit and similar available in several areas if you are pressed for time i would skip the innovations attraction the captain eo attraction unless you are a huge michael jackson fan the tiki room attraction and the train ride around the park s perimeter they all take a fair bit of time and there are much better attractions that are worth doing twice like star tours which as variations disneyland needs at least days to be enjoyed fully with all the attractions and shows if you are going to disneyland california adventure try to spend at least days there as well ,4,2012-09-04
4470,Consistent excellence,disney is disney fun busy tiring and unforgettable parks open midnight which you need to get round everything can be done in a day but you probably won t get to do everything in peak season ,5,2012-09-04
4471,Fab Disney,for a day we were kids again i love disney world in florida and disneyland was just as fun and magical we only had one day to visit disneyland and california adventure it can be done but you will miss some rides we did it without kids from park open to close and went on a tuesday after school started although august is still a busy time no matter what we also did not have any sit down meals we just picked up some quick bites and snacks throughout the park as we went but to be honest the lines were nothing compared to disney world and really not that long compared to cars land in california adventure i think the longest line we waited on was space mountain which was better than the one in disney world and that was maybe minutes the indiana jones line is always long so i would recommend getting a fast pass there if you have kids with you and want to take a more leisurely time i would recommend a full day in each park ,5,2012-08-31
4472,The happiest place on earth, disclaimer i have been to walt disney world in florida many many times i loved it so much i actually worked there for a good amount of time i might judge disneyland a little harder because of this i bought park hoppers park hoppers allow you to go to both parks in one day per adult a one day ticket at around will only allow you into only one park a day save your tickets because you use them to get fast passes send the fastest family member with all of your tickets to get fastpasses they have machines infront of the select rides who offer the pass i was excited to go to disneyland because disney is what i do and love additionally i have never been to disneyland they had easy parking and an efficient tram system to get you to the parks which were located very near to each other we went to california adventures first i suggest going to magic kingdom first if you have never gone to disney because it is great to walk in and see sleepy beauty s castle cali adventures we went to car s land first but that is where everyone was around go to cars land at night during world of color which you have to get fast passes for near grizzly canyon because it will be less crowded go there first to get fast passes as well because they will be sold out around am on mickey s ferris wheel do not get the swinging seats if you get sea sick there is a seperate line to get in for that i went to different shops to get a st visit badge and no one had one that is understandable but no one went above and beyond to help us find any we eventually got one back at the front at guest services people were friendly but not like they are at disney world they seemed to be more bored less inventive is this because i worked at disney world i saw cast members leaning and chatting with eachother we then went to magic kingdom get there before wishes start so you can get a picture with you and the castle in the light go do fantasyland first for rides because some rides close down after during wishes mr toad s wild ride is a personal favorite it is no longer at disney world so it was great to ride it here the popcorn girl in magic kingdom was very kind so i went to guest services like i know to do and comment on her kindness the guest service gentlemen didn t seem to care at all with what i was doing he was hesitant to even fill it out i was confused on why he didn t start writing right away he then just quickly jotted down my comment there was nobody in line so i don t understand why he wasn t more excited for his other cast member that she is receiving good recognition haunted mansion is my favorite ride of all time go here if you are hot but it might be scary for little ones fastpasses get them first for indiana jones car s land the racing cars soaring and your favorite fantasyland rides they are popular because those are great for all kids adults the aladdin show at cali adventures is a must see go there during the hottest parts of the day ask for first visit buttons or any button that might pertain to you like just married etc it was hard to see everything in a day so pick your must sees and do those first there are not a lot of quick service dining located inside the actual restaurants so go eat around pm to easily get tables in the shade look out for hidden mickeys as well they sell books on these disneyland is a must see for everybody at least once the more you are open to fun and magic you will have an outstanding time if you have a not so great time don t give up go again i know that the disney way is to make sure all guests are happy even though disneyland s outstanding guest service wasn t the best for me it is still better than other parks i also gave a because hardly anyone recognized my button even though i am they should still give me some acknowledgement again why you should choose disney parks fast passes are free safe clean magical family oriented theming and a lot to do thank you ps unlike universal you carry your bags onto the rides there aren t lockers for everyride to store your items i like disney s way better than universal s ,5,2012-08-29
4473,Love this place.,this is my most favourite place on earth clean fun happy lots of variety of food shopping rides this is just heaven on earth had not been here in about years and when i went back it was even better it just gets better with age ,5,2012-08-26
4474,Disney PERFECT FUN AND EXCITING,we likes everything disneyland was perfectly fun and very exciting each year we try to go to orange county and visit disneyland the beach and one more park either an l a or an orange county park if you fly and take the shuttle hotel bus to your hotel there are many shuttles leaving for any place in orange county as well and all of so cal these shuttles leave for disneyland wvery minutes and to the airport every hour then when you want to go to the beach or knott s or los angeles universal studios the bus coes from the hotel and takes you where you neen to go too this is the life vacations worry and stress f r e e enjoy everyone you desearve it ,5,2012-08-26
4475,Disneyland is always great!,plenty of fun total family entertainment the rides keep you going what else can you say it s disneyland ,5,2012-08-26
4476,"Magical, well run, classic",being a big disneyworld fan i had low expectations of disneyland but was very pleasantly surprised it was just as charming and while it must be smaller it felt just as modern and updated as its florida cousin food was mediocre but not outrageously priced we went the day the majority of children in ca went back to school and we were told the crowds were smaller that day employees were very accommodating and were able to convert days off of our lifetime tickets from disneyworld into single day park hopper disneyland tickets with cheerful no hassle help some rides seemed better at disneyland like pirates of the caribbean and the teacup ride and all of storybook land but others like the haunted mansion was not as elaborate or as fun the night we were there the park was open til midnight and we were able to get tons of rides in between and midnight the cinderella castle is so small compared to disneyworld but the whole place is just as magical ,4,2012-08-25
4477,A Perfect Vacation,my husband and i recently spent days at disneyland california adventure and it was everything we hoped it would be and more we are both just overgrown kids we spent the first day running all over the park riding everything we could and just grinning from ear to ear we were there thursday monday the first days were not bad at all sure there were crowds but by getting there early in the morning we were able to ride popular non fast pass rides use fast passes for the big rides and using a smart phone app to see what wait times were monday was really busy difficult to get around lines were twice as long as they had been the previous days and fast pass times were way too late in the evening for us since we had to catch an early shuttle back to the airport and the level of rudeness of others was unbelievable nothing like the first days where everyone seemed pleasant happy to be there making for a really magical and wonderful experience but i think over the course of the time we were there between the parks we must have done close to rides here is what i would recommend to anyone thinking of going do your research i knew what food each of the restaurants served and the cost so we were able to eat very well without breaking the bank go to the mint julip bar for disney s non alcoholic mint julip and micky shaped beignets if you can get there right when they open head for peter pan before it gets to busy we were able to average close to rides in the first hours use fast passes when available these really cut down on wait time for the big attractions and we were able to do a ton of rides while waiting for our times take breaks it is ok to go back to the hotel and rest go shopping eat outside the parks getting there when they open and staying until they close still leaves you with plenty of time to ride everything you want to if you have a smart phone get the disney park app it gives you wait times for the standby lines and the times that the fast passes will be good for overall if you are a kid at heart of any age you must go my husband and i can t wait to come back again ,5,2012-08-23
4478,Great time at Disnet,always enjoy disneyland with the family lines were much shorter since the ca adv cars land opened this year ,5,2012-08-21
4479,Best place on earth,if you are an adult that has never been and think that disneyland is only for children don t let that hold you back from visiting the happiest place on earth summer is very busy and lots of line ups but if you can go in the fall and still get nice weather and no line ups ,5,2012-08-20
4480,Happiest Place,enjoyed rides and whole experience favorite as always pirates of caribean also new star tours not enough time to do and see all ,4,2012-08-20
4481,Must Visit location !!,disney land park turned out to be very bit what we had imagined the park had everything for all ages we went there early morning and came out at the very end some tips be sure to go early in the day am should be best book on line and u will save some money as on line rates are lower take a two day both disney and california adventure pass and spend days at disneyland park about half a day for california adventure is fine be sure to visit the little kids section regardless of ur age this is really excellent and u will love every bit of it,5,2012-08-20
4482,The place where dreams come true..., this was our codeword for visiting disneyland as it was a surprise for our youngest daughter it s a nice place to visit at least once in your lifetime but it has become extremely expensive lately many of the rides haven t been updated in a while and they seem to take you through even faster disappointing after a min wait as opposed to orlando s disneyworld parks there aren t a lot of fastpass options just a handful so you ll have to spend hours in line a few tips discounted tickets are sometimes sold for cash only at anaheim hotels vs online disney you can also try aaa rates which are also a little cheaper if you ve seen them before or your kids don t care much about them skip the rides closest to the entrance e g snow white etc they are always crowded and much less enjoyable than others e g buzz lightyear roger rabbit etc if you have a young one who really needs to get her his autographs and pictures with princesses note that they switch every min between ariel belle tiana and aurora snow white cinderella so if you go for a hr long line you may not end up getting the pictures with the princesses you see then ask the staff when is the next switch and if needed wait until your favorites arrive merida and rapunzel have separate lines and we weren t able to find jasmine yes we spent almost hours in lines but now are the proud owners of all eight priceless autographs pics it s a small world ride was updated since i last saw it and as always gives the young and old a good feeling albeit far from really reflecting the real world but we re not there for that right jungle cruise splash mountain and most of the other pre teen teen rides had long lines all day so we skipped most the teacups had very short wait times all day and so did gadget s go coaster you can check lines wait times using iphone or android apps on your phone esp helpful if you have people ranging in interests in your party ,4,2012-08-19
4483,My childhood dreams came true.,as a little girl i always dreamed of going to disneyland unfortunately my family was never financially stable enough to be able to make that journey so it was completely magical and amazing for me to be able to at age take my two children ages and to disneyland my husband kids and i had a completely amazing time despite some blisters and a crazy amount of walking we learned after a day how to map out our game plan and ride route it was the most fantastic vacation we ve been on disney really does put a lot of the money you spend back into their parks you can tell via the quality of the shows rides performers and scenery that they work really hard to make disney as wonderful as you d imagine i would say my only complaint is i imagined disney costumed characters walking around all over the place so kids could get copious amounts of autographs and things there were more characters seen in california adventure than in disneyland and in disney to meet princesses you have to stand in line for a princess walk utilize the fast pass and come up with a good game plan and you shouldn t have to do a ton of waiting we were even there during busy season and the longest we waited was about minutes for a ride with an average of about minutes ,5,2012-08-18
4484,Best Place EVER!,first time visiting disneyland and it was amazing from the moment you step through the gates and past the crowds of people you will be amazed by the sights sounds and sheer atmosphere you can see children families and couples all bright eyed and excited for the day ahead you will feel like you are immersed into a whole new world away from reality the rides great too with all types and intensity to suit different people highlights for me were the haunted mansion which had awesome holographic images and its a small world when i went there it was still the holiday season so these rides had holiday themes to it another ride worth taking is the space mountain its a fast paced action ride even those who have a fear of roller coasters should take this ride you won t feel nauseous or anything the star wars ride was great too although abit short but a great experience nonetheless would definitely recommend everyone to go there at least once although i m sure once wouldn t be enough ,5,2012-08-16
4485,the happiest place on earth,we didn t know what to expect from disney land with so many people going through the gates all day it had the potential to be a head ache but we were pleasantly surprised everything was so well organised and the whole place was spotlessly clean all the staff whether it was in the shops manning the rides or the cleaning staff were friendly and happy we were also impressed with the prices of food and drinks they were very reasonable and not over inflated which can sometimes happen in places like this all in all a very long but happy day spent on rides shopping watching the parades and finishing with the spectacular fireworks display ,5,2012-08-16
4486,Fun and exhausting,wonderful time the wait times are accurate download a parks app for the wait times and make use of the fast passes available ,4,2012-08-15
4487,A little bit of Magic on the West Coast,disneyland is not quite walt disney world but it still has a ton of magic around if you like disney and are scared to try out walt disney world then disneyland is perfect for you because disneyland is much smaller and compact it is earier to manage and you still get the disney experience disneyland has a ton of great rides and a few surprises the park is quite compact which makes it easy to navigate but can also make it very crowded on the weekends in the summer it can be very hard get from ride to ride and the lines are very long finding a spot for fantasmic fireworks and parade can be a challenge but during the week or while school is in session is a different story during the busy times early entry is a must you can ride attrations before the park opens to the general public and even then you have a few more hours until the park gets busy around am we would normally take a break in the afternoon just to break up the day but the evenings in the park can get really crowded you need to find a good location for fantasmic at least minutes before the show you can see the fireworks from almost anywhere in the park during the fireworks parts of the park closes like toontown and fantasyland use the fast pass tickets as much as possible once you get a ticket it will be good for the return time on the ticket till the park closes i have been known to have or different attrations of fast pass tickets in my pocket so if the line shows minutes and you can get a fast pass for hours later get the pass and go find a different ride which does not give out fast pass tickets the secret is to never stand in line longer than minutes sometimes that is hard to do on rides like the matterhorn or the nemo sub ride but you need to do those rides early or late in the day fantasmic is worth the wait the parade is ok and the fireworks are awesome favorite ride space mountain most fun buzz lightyear best show fantasmic best food hot cinnamon rolls by haunted mansion or big thunder mountain or pineapple ice cream by tiki birds ,5,2012-08-10
4488,Alberto and family,this theme park was over crowded then you have to wait for a ride like about an hour then they came with the excuse that the ride broke down and it wasn t only one ride it happens to five rides they came with the same excuse the food was so expensive all over the area including the harbor street the t shirts forget it too expensive too then the fast pass they make you wait for about three hours for the next ride and still you have to wait in line this was my third time and my last i go there then we went to universal studios and sea world that was great no problem waiting too long in line the ride were working alright that i love it the best and the best about disneyland i give them a big zero bye,1,2012-08-09
4489,Come on Tripadvisor - we need a 6th circle AMAZING!!!!,wow first time disneylanders we loved it tips get in early you can easily jump on consecutive rides in a row without a wait if you get there early map out your plan of attack prior to park opening use the fast pass system single rider system more rides more fun there is plenty of food available in the park not all junk food reasonably priced buy a park hopper it s worth the extra cash be prepared to queue for the top attractions fast pass them enjoy it it truely is the most magical place on earth ,5,2012-08-08
4490,Such a huge waste of money,i took my grandkids to disneyland on a saturday spent a piece to get a day park hopper ticket it was so crowded that we only got on maybe rides all day i would say the average wait was to minutes per ride and even for the small kid rides they were at least minutes we waited in one line for minutes and did not move inch the food was exorbitant as well spending for a hamburger and fries next time i will go during the week or around christmas when it is not too crowded it was so crowded we did not have any fun at all we wanted to rent an electriic cart for my handicapped husband and it was dollars we spent dollars at other amusement parks i think walt would be turning overi in his grave if he knew ,1,2012-08-07
4491,Disneyland - always great,we just discovered the petting zoo area behind thunder mountain it s great for kids and there are character encounters that don t require a minute standing wait in line ,5,2012-08-05
4492,What A Rip OFF,way too expensive to get in the park which used to be kept up was dirty papers and things all over the place tried to find a hot dog vender no more they want you to go inside one of their expensive places to eat security was not to be found walt is turning over in his grave ,1,2012-08-04
4493,So much fun,definately use fast pass when you can go early and plan your days and what rides you want to ride if you get magic mornings do fantasyland then,5,2012-08-04
4494,Magic All Around,been coming here since i was born i can t say enough i have loved climbing on rocks on tom sawyers island to traveling through space on space mountain trick or treated all dressed up cookie decorated at christmas always something fun to do the cast does an excellent job constantly redecorating the park for each season a lot of people think it is expensive but in this instance you get what you pay for worth every penny ,5,2012-07-29
4495,Nice. Never cheap.,while disneyland is always a nice place to be at it s not cheap if celebrating an anniversary or birthday go to customer relations and ask for a pin most employees will give you a nice happy birthday greet as some visitors will do so also food is regular and kind of expensive definitely arrive early and use your speed pass you can do the most busy rides first thing in the morning without big crowds is possible avoid big crowds when planning your trip by attending the park on weekdays and off the regular school vacation dates the hotels across the street are closer than the parking lots and not that expensive we stayed at the best western park place inn and suites and it was a great decision no more that a minute walk to both main park entrances one day for each park days will cover most of the better attractions if not all of them ,5,2012-07-27
4496,What a Disappointment!,boy before you purchase disneyland passes rethink your decision the place is overcrowded overpriced with long line ups for everyone the fast passes do assist a little with the older rides but it s true the new ride cars fast passes were sold out and to stand in line was over hrs i felt sorry for the people and kids in that long line up waiting to go on that ride the food in the restaurants is awful as they are in a hurry to get you in and out due to the volume of people the bathrooms when you can find them are old on the disneyland side and for the million plus people that go thru the park the one ladies bathroom i did find had one change table which i thought was sad considering it s suppose to be a park for families another disappointment was not seeing mickey until late in the evening and than oh guess what another line up to have a picture taken with him pluto was actually turning away from the kids etc as people were trying to get his attention for a picture it s a big park i m sure having additional mickey s etc walking around the park won t matter to people as long as could get a picture anyway for the amount of you pay don t bother it really does suck considering it s suppose to be a fun place we won t return again considering i didn t even take my son ,2,2012-07-26
4497,When traveling to Disneyland from Vancouver you might want to consider..., plan to visit disneyland itself for two days only each park one day is plenty no need to buy parkhopper tickets avoid weekends annual pass holders show up by friday afternoon huge crowds careful with january february trips lots of storms rain maintenance dress for fall if going in winter temperatures change by ten degrees from noon to night take a backpack with a jacket hat gloves something to cut the wind book your flight to john wayne airport not l a closer to disney less shuttle fee quieter fly with westjet direct flight to john wayne once day fewer passengers no extra luggage fee not red eye flight bring headphones snacks everything on the plane is expensive book airport shuttle ahead of time go fly charges per person plus tax plus tip which is still cheaper than most other shuttles book flight via expedia book hotel directly and over the phone it s cheaper howard johnson is reasonably priced clean building has views onto fireworks floor not facing freeway is close to mimi s restaurant good food not only will save money this way you get to choose your room in the hotel pick a deluxe it has a fridge microwave coffeemaker there s a convenience store in the hotel which is reasonable in price if instead booking b b share with friends watch out for cleaning fee if booking a car consider parking fees day at disney xmas at disneyland is magical the decorations alone a spectacular and worth the trip go in late november early december if you want to see the parade reserve seats on the curb early it will be impossible to watch or get in by the time the parade starts enter the park early eat lunch early eat dinner early to avoid the crowds make use of fast passes if necessary when not at disneyland greyline tours can be booked from hotel they offer trips to san diego zoo universal studios etc giving explanations about the sights you pass one way showing a movie when coming back i would not recommend choosing seaworld it s a rip off expensive entry fee bad food for much money sad conditions for some animals consider safari park san diego instead there is too much good stuff to be said about disneyland it s all been written about numerous times so here is my only complaint too much noise ,5,2012-07-24
4498,Good Times,our family loves disneyland and california adventure but what i really appreciate about disneyland is that they are very considerate about the lines for special needs children we have a little one with autism and he would not be able to wait in line for more than three min he cannot stand in line around so many people yet it makes him nervous etc but with the alternate attraction entrance it makes it better for other people us and less nerve wrecking easier peaceful joyful for him ,5,2012-07-24
4499,Awesome fun!,spent a second day at disneyland california adventure after getting short lines on my first day at disneyland fast passes and single rider passes are an awesome resource to collect for single rider passes just ask the person near the entrance to the ride for a pass if they re giving them out on the way for fast passes use your disneyland ticket in the machines close by to the rides you can use them anytime after first time indicated on the ticket these let you skip the long lines and you re usually on the ride within minutes depending on the ride best thing about the rides at disneyland is that they re very accommodating to larger people i was never rejected or refused admission on a ride due to not fitting into restraints and considering that i rode about rides on both days each i was incredibly happy with my experience food is a bit costly especially drinks for a soda or for a mineral water being a solo traveller money wasn t a big issue but for families it can become a bit costly the parks are fairly spread out so you ll do lots of walking to get to different areas rides wear comfortable shoes ,5,2012-07-24
4500,1st visit at 55yrs old-don't wait this long-FAB!,purchased tickets online to save queuing when we arrived went on a thursday to avoid weekend scrum but it was still very busy due to school hols easy to find but drive took hrs from andaz hotel on sunset boulevard then onto i well organised parking long walk plus elevators to transport to park well set up for strollers wheelchair users if you don t like roller coasters head for pirates of the caribbean ride small drops then amazing animatronics and effects it s a small world immediately after the main street parade as there was no wait then buzz light years astroblasters fun shooting dumbo and teacups in fantasyland i hate rides and was surprised how many i could go on which turned a must do day for my teen daughter into a fab day for all be prepared to walk around about miles during the day so wear comfy shoes to see the fantasmic show and the fireworks get a place near the haunted mansion but not too near the lake as you need to scoot over to main street in front of the disney castle to get the best views of the fireworks they tell you to stay where you are but you won t get the best views to see tinkerbell fly unless you can see the castle i would recommend this to anyone no matter how sceptacle yes it s long waits for some rides but it s clean organised and well worth doing ,5,2012-07-22
4501,Had an awesome time,we only stayed one day at disneyland in june it was a nice sunny day went we went but not real hot their fastpass system was a great time saver and allowed us to ride more rides as it was very busy when we went we live near disney world so we wanted to ride the rides that magic kingdom didn t have we had a very enjoyable day ,5,2012-07-22
4502,"It's all about the fast pass, baby.",i expected my visit to disneyland to be tiring and full of line ups i was pleasantly surprised by how well the park is run if you plan out your day using the fast pass system there is not need for absurd line ups the park is clean and employees are exceptionally friendly and helpful ,5,2012-07-20
4503,Not what Walt intended!,i have been to disneyland at all times of the year and autumn is by far my favorite the weather is beautiful and the crowds are at a minimum we have found that the first two weeks of september are the least crowded once the halloween decor comes out check disney s website for dates so do more people but even with the increase in traffic we waited in line an average of only to minutes longer per ride than we did on previous trips taken earlier in september i have also heard that the first week of november is good because the halloween stuff is still out but the crowds have again decreased it should be said though that more rides are closed for refurbishment at this time and there are fewer shows and fireworks check the disney website will tell you what ones we have stayed at the disneyland hotel and most recently the fairfeild inn by mariott the fairfeild inn was great for several reasons it was nice and clean and the bed was super comfy no kidding the most comfortable bed i have ever slept on it wasn t spectacular but nice it was about a minute walk if that from the main door of the hotel to the main enterence of disneyland and california adventure and the fact that it is about cheaper than staying at the disneyland hotel makes it a good choice but if money were not an issue i would definitely stay at the disneyland hotel it s fun to never leave the disney magic is it worth the money i m saving up so we can stay there again on out next visit as far as eating goes we saved a ton of money by eating breakfast in our room packing snacks and pb j for lunch and eating dinner in the park we love goofy s kitchen which is located at the disneyland hotel the food is good and my three kids told a neighbor that this was their favorite part of the vacation you have to make reservations in advance we have eaten there for breakfast and dinner both are great but i think you get more for your money by doing dinner prime rib will win over waffles every time in my book and the prices are the same on the night we ate dinner there the monorail was not running we we had to walk to the restaraunt we walked fast and made it there in about or so minutes you do need to make a reservation and plan on about hours to eat when we left we were so full we could hardly walk let alone ride rides so we spend the evening watching the parade and shopping for souveniers a note about the world of color show at disney california adventure don t miss it my husband admitted that he was not really looking forward to this but it turned out to be one of his favorite parts of the trip when we were there in we needed a fast pass which are handed out inside the park we went right to the fast pass booth first thing in the am and they literally handed us the last passes remember that the park opens early on days starting with the letters t and s so if you can plan to take advantage of an extra hour in the park on these days to help us book our vacations we used a travel agency called get away today they are friendly know their stuff and saved us money i recommend them highly i hope you have as much fun on your autumn trip to disneyland as we did ,2,2012-07-19
4504,plan Fall trip to Disneyland,everything wonderful and just like what walt disney said you leave your present behind and enter the land yesterday tomorrow and fantasy i will give them out of for cleanliness rides were fabulous exciting enjoyable many seemed to be out of the world i wish though food and gifts could have been somewhat cheaper i know i know this is after all a business and there re stock holders ,5,2012-07-18
4505,You can never beat Disney!,disneyland is my favorite getaway i am a disney passholder have been for years if you live in southern california i do recommend getting an annual passport you get more for your money and annual pass perks just recently they started an early hour entry to the park of your choice for the summer but you do have to register also discounts on food and merch and invitations to some disney events they have from time to time if you are on a budget i recommend bringing an ice chest for drinks and food and buy a locker in the picnic area at disneyland but make sure the ice chest is not to big it needs to fit in locker they do have different size lockers at a price also what i do to not over spend i buy a disney gift card at my budget amount so im not carrying money and credit cards so i don t have that urge to over spend during the summer months i freeze bottles of water and put them in a hydration backpack and add snacks it s easy to carry around and the frozen water keeps your back cool and you don t need to give into buying high price bottled water at the park on main street if you buy coffee at the market house free coffee all day just show your receipt for a refill ,5,2012-07-17
4506,First visit and loved it!!,we found disneyland not live up to our expectations like everyone we have been dreaming about visiting since childhood well it took about yrs to get here though to wait overran hour for each ride ate into the time we would ve have liked to explore what other sights and attractions the park had to offer i guess that s why they recommend a day pass as day is not nearly long enough how ve ce i must say the pluto pups or corn dogs are out of this world ,5,2012-07-16
4507,Disney Lover's Dream,we had a great time at disneyland our group consisted of several adults and two teenagers four yr olds and three little one s under three we broke up into groups with one adult for each child i would recommend going to california adventures first if you plan on going to the cars ride attraction the wait to get a fast track usually is sold out by a m and that is for coming back to ride the attraction around p m seriously folks don t mess with the timing if you want to ride that attraction you must get there first thing in the a m because the fast track line is already lining up for blocks by a m we ended up forgoing it because of the late lines and when we changed our mind to return they were already sold out of the fast track it is the most popular ride this season the crowds were heaviest after ish in disneyland our bet is most people were at the california adventures trying to get on the car attractions so if you want to go on the popular rides at disneyland go in the morning as the late afternoon is crazy busy ,5,2012-07-11
4508,Expensive and packed,disneyland boasts the reputation for being the happiest place on earth we agree it is hard not to get caught up in all the excitement there is plenty to do all day with rides street parades by disney characters night shows and fireworks do some research on the net before you go to learn how best to use the fast passes it will save you lots of time in queues and help you get the most out of your day early in the day upon entry we found disney characters posing for photos with short queues so go early and spend the day anaheim is also a beautiful place with plenty reasonable accommodation within easy walking distance to disneyland ,3,2012-07-09
4509,Crowds Abound But Fun Nevertheless,it is not an inexpensive trip when you go to disneyland it was well worth the trip had a great experience despite the thousands of other people who were there ,5,2012-07-09
4510,Wonderful,well you know the basics expensive crowded hot and way too much standing in line but it s an experience everyone must have atleast twice in their lives especially kids it s a dream land i honestly had several moments of truly feeling like a kid again a kid with an aching back and even more aching wallet after the hour adventure practically covered of the attractions rides and my favorites were the indiana jones finding nemo submarine jungle cruise pirates of the carribean and the haunted mansion everyone was friendly and accomodating on the down side we experienced rides having to shut down for minutes finding out after having already waited minutes in line a let down but will always remember my disneyland experience as positive and once in a lifetime gave it a score because it cannnot measure up to disney world ,5,2012-07-09
4511,Queues Queues Queues!,well you just have to take the kids to disneyland one time in their life i was born in the s and it was the dream place to go i never got to go to disneyland as a child i wanted to live vicariously through my kids what is good about disneyland we enjoyed all the rides they all were really amazing so interactive and surprising and there was something for everyone went with a year old girl and year old boy my kids actually had a fantastic time on treasure island there are no rides there but the pirates entertainment on the boat across was very funny and they stayed in character the whole time the kids enjoyed running around the island looking for treasure they actually found a whole lot of old coins i don t know if they were put there or if my kids are particularly resourceful and climbed around where they were not supposed to but they came back with a dozen old rusty coins from various countries they really got into the whole treasure seeking experience what i did not like the queues they just take up so much of your time you spend most of the day standing on concrete so make sure everyone has comfortable shoes i just don t know why they don t put down soft rubber to stand on rather than concrete make sure you get fast passes where ever you can because even with those you are still going to wait half an hour per ride the second things i did not like was the food you just could not get any healthy food anywhere it was all fatty fried disgusting food i would strongly recommend you bring your own real food unless you are used to the american diet of fat fast food disneyland was surprisingly the worst theme park for healthy food it was also relatively expensive the last thing i did not like was the price of all the toys and the fact that after every ride you went through a shop as a parent it gets exhausting and unpleasant having to say no the whole day i really wanted to buy my little girl some mini ears but they were something like there was just very little you could get for under again compared to the other theme parks universal studio sea world san diego the prices for toys and souvenirs was excessive you pay enough for the entry price spend of your time queueing up and the rest of your time dragging kids out of gif stores on your way out of rides i hope the kids have a great memory of disneyland because i m never going back if money is not an issue for you then i m sure you will have a fabulous time ,4,2012-07-02
4512,Crazy busy place in June!,we have been here other times but never in the summer will never do it again in high season like ants in an anthill you can hardly move rides from minutes waiting to minutes who waits over hours for a ride and fastpasses gone by am only one fast pass at a time and the return time on them hours line ups for everything food bathroom water fountains everything i guess i just didn t realize there s no maximum to the number of guests allowed in the park at one time seriously if there was a fire the mass panic and stampede would be deadly all in all we enjoyed our time but not nearly like the other four times the rose colored glasses are off try the plaza inn for the chicken dinner for best deal in the park and there aren t many deals to be had also enjoyed the chicken nuggets and fish sticks at the stage door cafe in frontireland the turkey legs the churros and of course the pinapple floats at the tiki hut if you can handle the crowds it s a fun place to be try the off season and it s much better ,3,2012-06-29
4513,love this place,this was our th trip here we love it make sure you ride splash mtn pirates of the carribean haunted house it s a small world indiana jones jungle cruise and we always take the train on a tour around the park ,5,2012-06-28
4514,"It's Disney, what can I say?",we took to calling it disneyline the lines are out of control even though we had magic mornings we found the lines the noise and the masses of people overwhelming at times waiting in line for absolutely everything was not quite what we expected we even waited in lines to get into a line crazy stuff look it s disneyland and i think if you get the opportunity you have to do it once in your life but the reality compared to the marketing are slightly askew i don t regret going there of coure we enjoyed it to an extent but it was so tiring and so busy i wouldn t rush to go back we probably missed the boat a bit too our kids at and were just a little too old to get caught up in the magic i regret not taking the kids when they were a bit younger i think we all would have got a bit more out of the trip if they d been a bit younger and still caught up in the disney characters and movies i d also suggest staying for about a week we only had three full days to do both disneyland and california adventure given the hectic nature of both parks we could have been a little more relaxed if we had had more time to take things slowly and this would have left us in a better position to deal with the lines ,3,2012-06-27
4515,A Scooter 4 U Anaheim,i always rent a scooter when i go to conferences or to amusement parks the extra money spent is well worth it a scooter makes the difference between a great time and one that is extremely physically challenging this time i had a little snag i was just finishing up at a conference at the marriot i had planned within the next half hour to go to disneyland before i left i went to the bathroom just as the toliet self flushed i heard something hit it it was my scooter key a scooter u has such great customer service that they were there within an hour with a another key and they did not charge me i highly recommend this company for all your scooter needs ,5,2012-06-26
4516,Did not want to leave the Happiest Place on Earth!,we spent four days here in june as a family of this was a first visit for us all to celebrate our daughter s th birthday in july it was everything we hoped it would be and more the cast members were delightful and always happy to be of assistance our daughter loved the attention she received wearing her special birthday button we loved loved the fireworks over sleeping beauty s castle it brought tears to my eyes as it was something i had always dreamed about seeing i had expected it to be super busy being summertime in the us but was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not we didn t really have the need to utilise the fast pass system as the longest wait we had on any ride was about minutes tops the wait time never seemed that long because we were caught up looking at all the details provided by disney in the set up of the rides we were able to ride all the rides we had wanted some more than once in the time we had there can not wait to go back again ,5,2012-06-26
4517,Birthday celebration,it was just before carsland opened to the public the parks were not that crowded we always have a wonderful time there and this time was no different always remember to do fastpass this will save you so much time and frustration waitin g in lines ,5,2012-06-26
4518,"The 1st, and still great!",if you re familiar with walt disney world in florida the small size of disneyland is very apparent but that works to it s advantage because it s very easy to walk the short distances between attractions the combination of disneyland and disney s california adventure has most of the attractions of all theme parks at wdw with the exception of most of epcot center great place to go crowds are large but there s always something fun to do without waiting in long lines leave the kids at home if you can it s a lot of fun for adults ,5,2012-06-25
4519,Magic happens,i am an annual pass holder and go to disneyland a couple times per month on the last trip i went to photograph the evening fireworks and had fun doing that ,5,2012-06-24
4520,Happiest Place on Earth,rides theming are great good times for all spent hours straight in park and had a wonderful time lines were average in day and very long at night,5,2012-06-22
4521,"I mean c'mon, it's Disneyland...",these folks know how to treat their guests we had three of our group in wheelchairs but never missed out on anything had a great visit staff went out of their way to accomodate everybody in the group ,5,2012-06-20
4522,Great time!,we are big disney people and go to both california and florida as we live in texas when you go to florida most people are tourists we noticed this time in june at disney that most of the people were locals there for the day that treat the park like it s the local carnival when we walk down main street we get a feeling of awe and excitement but this time the park was crowded with grads for some grad night and tons of locals who have annual passes i thought they are blacked out during the high tourist seasons so for those of us who come once every few years we were faced with longer than usual lines and lots of screaming babies toddlers and people who for them it was just another day at the local carnival disney needs to offer more incentives to people who stay at their hotels use the wdw travel company and disney visa like we did maybe give us fast passes special character meet and greets at our hotels that are not a character meal more discounts as we are spending alot more money than the people that live there and when you don t receive a great experience you are not in a hurry to come back that being said this was the third time we have been to disneyland in years and every time the matterhorn is closed the rides were all enjoyable and lots of fun we spent two days at disneyland and one day at dca and was able to ride everything we wanted to except splash because of long lines no more fast passes and it broke down once we met a few characters but the lines for the princesses were hour min the food at the park we ate at pizza port by space mountain was terrible and expensive disney needs better food options for a bottle of water is so ridiculous if there s one item you should charge less for it s the water bottles love the mickey ice cream bars and mickey pretzels should you go to disneyland or world many of the rides at dl are better than the ones at wdw such as thunder mt pirates small world etc they are the original rides and are longer and more fun the park is much smaller in california though so maybe there are less people but they are congested in smaller spaces overall if you are a disney or ride fan this is a great park but look carefully at the calendar of events and annual pass holder dates to see if this park will be crowded or not ,5,2012-06-19
4523,A magical place but no perks for tourists,we spent days here and at adventureland and that was just enough to get everything done took our two children it was a blast i was surprised how much myself and my partner enjoyed the rides etc as adults loved indiana jones spalsh mountain big thunder mountain and star tours and was scared out of my wits by space mountain ,4,2012-06-15
4524,Loved it,love love love this place first time to disneyland and it lived up to all my expectations we had a day pass and could probably say another day or even would have topped it off but in those days we got to do almost all the rides in disney and about half at california adventure do not go on a weekend so glad we did days on a weekday so much less crowded the saturday was packed and had to wait a very long time in lines got to see all the characters they are constantly around and on occasions someone new would pop up the rides are all fun for all ages break downs of any rides were fixed very quickly food choices are the usual theme park food burgers and fries but no complaints disneyland soooo much better than california adventure do not need more than a day at ca would recommend anyone staying in los angeles or anaheim to do disneyland and also to stay either at the disney resorts or hotels across the road best thing was to be able to walk home after a long day at the park instead of waiting for a shuttle bus home would do it all again in a heartbeat ,5,2012-06-15
4525,Dreams really do come true!!!!,i have been to disney world and on paper it makes disneyland look like a joke i went in having positive thoughts but just did not have a great experience all around the rides comparing to disney world are actually a lot shorter with the exception of pirates of the caribbean there really isn t a hole lot to do in these parks due to wait times we pretty much spent the entire day at disneyland till the park closed the prices on food are very pricey and the quality in my opinion is very poor i didn t care to much for the staff at here in orlando everyone has such a different attitude i came across a couple rude employees and unhelpful ones as well not mention that throughout the day certain rides were going down and not functioning that is by far the last thing that i would expect from disney all in all if you can go to florida by all means go to florida and do not waste your time here ,5,2012-06-14
4526,Choose a Different Amusement Park,we live in southern california but a couple of hours north of disneyland our family of have had annual passes for about years now we started out using it as christmas gifts for us just have continued it makes it easier throughout the years for days when you just don t know what to do the premium pass is the way to go free parking s off merch food it s great really nice to just take our son see a show have dinner super nice not worrying about if we didn t get to ride a particular ride this time because we ll be back next week or soon enough after a couple of years we know disneyland inside out plus did i forget to mention w the premium passes you get to park hop the same day especially nice since california adventure has been expanding the holidays are super fun too inexpensive way to go halloween trick or treat throughout the park christmas snow birthday parties are extremely nice to have here as well any meal with characters are a certain win birthday cake decorating with pat e cake is so fun take advantage of fast passes too note to disneyland please stop selling us cheap china made toys for so expensive love the toys hate the quality in some ,2,2012-06-09
4527,Fun times,my daughter and i are disney history buffs and we love this park we were told to be disappointed because it is smaller than disney world but forget that it was great and we loved it ,5,2012-06-09
4528,Fun and Historical,use the fast passes to boost your ridership of the attractions eat early around or for lunch and for dinner to beat the long lines hit the most popular rides indiana jones etc first before the lines get longer ,5,2012-06-07
4529,D-land is amazing.,we went to disneyland on memorial day which i m sure was terrible timing for the crowds but was the only day that we could go as we were on a business trip that being said the lines were not as bad as i thought they would be and we took full advantage of working the fast pass system as well as the single rider service as adults i think that a full day is enough to do both parks if you are not really interested in going on every ride and if you are prepared to put the full day into it get there early and leave late something else i thought i d mention despite there being so many people in the park i never had to wait to go to the bathroom and these were kept clean and tidy if you had kids then you would definitely need a lot more time as there is so much for them to do and see fireworks were a stunning finish ,5,2012-06-07
4530,Disneyland can't Compare with DisneyWorld,disneyland sucked rides were not running restaurants were closed lines were long it was my first and definitely my last trip to disneyland disneyworld is a hundred times better there is no comparison ,1,2012-06-05
4531,Time of your life,the park was clean we went at the start of summer break it was crowded but we never had to wait for more than minutes on most of the little kid rides we lost our camera at the beach so we took advantage of the disney photographers they take great shots which you can view and order online character photos always have another cast member forming and keeping the line orderly this is a big improvement over the kid frenzies of the past use the magic morning to ride peter pan and others with long wait times the day park hopper meant we could take our time and not have to rush the two little ones took naps in hotel both afternoons they stayed up one night to see the fireworks but it is too much for a year old to stay up after pm the first third of the pirates of the carribean is a very scary proabably more so than the haunted mansion for a child under the jungle cruise ride and storybook land canal are both more enjoyable after dark this surprised me as i have been going here for years the live music is exceptional at disneyland we made a reservation and ate lunch at blue bayou for a monte cristo sandwich diner is an entre not worth the price but the food is good and you are paying for the atmosphere we had little ones so i couldn t ride space mtn indiana jones etc my favorite kiddie ride was astro blasters you battle the evil zorg with laser blasters and a cart you control i was so into shooting all the targets that i barely notice my year old standing up in the seat next to me jumping up and down trying to defend the universe it is fun if you are a gamer because you get a score and can enter you name after the ride ends the jedi training academy show is a lot of fun our little ones were too little to follow directions so we watched the show two days in a row during lunch it is a funny show and the kids get excited to see dark vader and the storm troopers the princes fantasy fair is something we really wanted to see the wait times were too long the first two days we checked the third day we got in line minutes before the am opening we were told that everything in the fantasy fair was closed except the pictures with the princesses normally there are three princesses but today there was only belle and princess mini it was a big disappointment for many of the princesses in the crowd we still waited the minutes to get pictures with belle it was worth it as she took time to talk to our and year old the fireworks show is incredible if you are taking pictures the fireworks explode over the left side of the castle so position yourself to the right the disneyland train is great for getting you quickly around the crowds from the parade and night time shows it doesn t matter you age you will have a great time in disneyland ,5,2012-06-04
4532,Not quite as magical as it once was,i made my first trip to disneyland nearly years ago and have been or times since then as recently as years ago i ve also been to disney world or times this most recent trip brought back some fond memories but i though some of the original disney esqe touches have been lost other s have spoken of the crowds lines and cost disney s pr department seemed to blow it by dramatically raising the park hopper prices three weeks before a new section of california adventure park was to open seemed greedy also there website information was spotty how do parking shuttles work and to have not warned about grad night s mobs was very inconsiderate but i found myself disappointment in the cross marketing of virtually everything woody and jessie show up in small world swiss family robinson s tree house is not tarzan s treehouse and not nearly as whimsical even the jack sparrow additions to pirates of the caribbean seemed cheezy plus we experienced several ride breakdowns no doubt many of the rides are still spectacular our family loved space mountain the haunted mansion thunder mtn railroad even the cheesy jungle cruise plus we enjoyed the newer rides at ca park california screaming soaring over california among others i think i would recommend disney world over disneyland one person told us that with the annual passes for locals it s become a teen hangout like the mall so it s always crowded also disney world being larger seems to absorb the crowds better best dl advice go early in the morning and hit as much as possible as fast as possible then slow down and accept that there will be lines later in the day if you can t make disney world and want the disney experience by all means go to disneyland but know what you are getting into and for goodness sake avoid grad nights ,3,2012-06-04
4533,Best Vacation for the WHOLE family!,travelling with my wife and two young children our recent trip to diisneyland was by far the best family vacation we ve been on and that includes three trips to hawaii in the past years we were travelling with young children and years old but we all loved it so much that we spent an average of hours per day in the parks and we visited the park on consecutive days thats how much we all loved it we were apprehensive about booking this vacation because of the age of our kids but we collectively had the best times of our lives we stayed at a hotel close walking distance to the parks and that allowed us to spend a few hours there in the morning walk back to the hotel for naps and pool time and then a short walk back to the parks for a few more hours of fun if travelling with small children i strongley reccomend staying at a nice hotel close to the park we stayed at the sheraton park hotel the kids loved meeting the characters going on rides and seeing all the wonder that is disneyland cant wait to go back if you are questioning taking young children i say go for it have reasonable expectations and plan your trip well but the kids loved it right up to the late night fireworks ,5,2012-06-02
4534,Grad Night equals Everyone else gets screwed.,may th was apparently grad night at disneyland this would have been helpful information to plan the late night part of our trek to ride rides on our way from the parking garage to the main entrance our tram operator indicated that the park was open until midnight just after pm we made our way over to splash mountain as it had been broke earlier in the day and a pass to get on fast due to the earlier delays we rounded thunder mtn and found a blockade only grads with wristbands could go through we explained what we knew and and how frustrated we were that this was never communicated the employee sympathized with us and said some parts of the park were closed what we found out shortly thereafter was all of the park was then closed to grads only only main street shops food was open til midnight what a bunch of garbage sorry but if i had known that the park was closed at a that would have been fine but we were informed midnight since we live in colorado we don t frequent disneyland so it was just very frustrating and upsetting another issue was the break down of many of the big rides space mtn splash mtn and indiana jones on a positive the food was great throughout the park we had lunch at the big thunder ranch all you can eat ribs chicken and it was great the fireworks show over sleeping beauty s castle at pm are a can t miss they were awesome tip be extra mindful of any events that close all the rides ,3,2012-05-31
4535,Horrible,as long as you get in early and have a plan it works pretty much like clockwork leave in the afternoon evenings are crazy i am actually glad they are raising the prices on the season passes for locals as that is what makes all the craziness most of the tourists are very polite the young adults there on season passes run around the park run when they open the different areas and generally are oblivious to manners ,1,2012-05-31
4536,It's Disney and you have to be a FAN!,maybe i m biased but i still like disneyland far better than disney world disneyland is still home to me i now live miles away but it s worth the trip it will be a year and a half before i can return again but i can t wait to see the new cars addition to the ca adventure next time ,5,2012-05-28
4537,Nothing compared to Disney!,by the end of the day my five year old daughter was exhausted from all the fun the rides the lightshow be aware that the fireworks can get cancelled because of non perfect weather and the queues can be over mintues long during peak times i have been unlucky enough to have had rides break down as well i does not matter i asked my daughter what was the best part she said all of it ,5,2012-05-27
4538,Go Mickey!,my teenagers loved this park we went first thing in the morning left in the afternoon then came back refreshed and stayed until it closed space mountain thunder mountain rr and buzz lightyear were our favorite rides a must go if visiting southern california ,5,2012-05-26
4539,Grad Nite Ugh!,we are annual passholders and didn t realize that disneyland was hosting grad nite the day of our most recent visit there was a number of loud and somewhat obnoxious teenagers disneyland closed earlier than usual p m because of grad nite many rides space mountain indiana jones big thunder mountain closed minutes before even though we have had the pass for several years this is the first time we ve been to disneyland on a grad nite having experienced it we now know to avoid it ,4,2012-05-26
4540,May Disneyland,great weather great food great rides i disliked all the stroller traffic my family of three were constantly dodging some women running with her stroller i have year old and she was able to walk everywhere i saw kids her age and older in strollers it was nuts ,5,2012-05-25
4541,Had a blast!,we planned our trip carefully before going to make sure we would have time to ride our favorite rides because we were only going for one day so before going we read reviews or watched videos of all of the disneyland rides and made a color coded list of must do rides the list was color coded according to the colors on the disneyland park map that can be found online by doing this we were able to ride every ride we wanted to ride before leaving the park and skip all the rides that didn t seem as fun to us we truly had a blast and the rides were amazing our children are just big enough to be able to ride all of the rides in the main disneyland park so it was perfect timing for a trip like this however we also enjoyed the park when we took them as babies as well this park has plenty for people of all ages ,5,2012-05-24
4542,BABYSTROLLERS,i appreciate that children of all ages come to the disneyland but disneyland needs to figure out a way to park the strollers in a more safe less intrusive way causes huge pile ups of pedestrians trying to maneuver around these temporary parking areas for strollers ,3,2012-05-23
4543,Held Hostage,the day would have been wonderful except that we lost our backpack with car keys id credit cards on the indiana jones ride i was sent away times and waited hours to get it back it was only returned because my yr old was crying in front of everyone that they would not let us leave so much for happiest place on earth i was hours late for the meds i had in the same bag they were going to make me wait until the park closed to get it midnight they did take pitty on us at dinner time and gave us a voucher to pizza port so i could feed my daughter something but only because i pointed out i had no money when they finally stopped the ride to get my backpack turns out there was a whole lot of belongings on the track like a another womens purse i felt bad that i was inconviencing people waiting in line but really i waited patiently hours they need to have a better plan i think our annual trip will be to magic mountain from here on out ,2,2012-05-22
4544,Disneyland - something for everyone,traveling with three boys teen tween and toddler disneyland really delivered in terms of pleasing everyone three days was enough for us but we didn t see every attraction we did plan what we wanted to see and managed to check everything off the list i would recommend going during the week the crowds can be overwhelming or at least get there early an go on some of the more popular rides before the masses arrive ,5,2012-05-19
4545,"Love Disney, but I have to say I was very dissapointed with park management.",my family purchased a day hopper pass on wednesday night we were taken off of the line for space mountain after waiting for minutes due to technical difficultes the next morning my kids were eager to hit indiana jones first we entered the park and headed right over to the indy ride only to find it was shut down due to technical difficulties we headed over to california adventure to hit soarin only to find guests being escorted off the ride due to what we were told were technical difficulties so we went on over to the toy story ride which was shut down to you guessed it technical difficulties later that thursday night we headed back to disneyland to go on roger rabbit s cartoon spin after waiting on line for over minutes we were told the ride was no operating due to technical difficulties finally that night we went to go back on indy to find it again shut down this was all on thursday the following day friday the buzz lightyear ride was closed around pm for reasons the cast member by the entrance could not tell me then we headed over to the star tours ride to get fastpass and we were told by a cast member that fast pass for this ride was not available because they ran out of tickets we paid over for a day hopper pass and lost out on about a day and a half worth of rides i intend to chase down some of my money back we normally go to disney world every year but decided to give disneyland a try what a dissapointment ,4,2012-05-13
4546,The Happiest Place on Earth!,truely a wonderful experience to visit disneyland the atmosphere can t help but make you smile often i was somewhat dissappointed with california adventure there seems to be a lot of wasted space and a lot of walkihg between attractions from grizzly bear to arial there are nice looking buildings that seem to do nothing i also don t understand the arcade area that does nothing for me i would prefer to see more rides the new section looks like it will be a fun addtion i m looking forward to my next visit to see how it all turns out ,5,2012-05-11
4547,fairytale land,we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at the park most rides were pretty similar across the other disneylands but what stood out were the finding nemo submarine ride and the toontown or somethin ,5,2012-05-09
4548,LOVED our trip to Disneyland!,this was our first time at disneyland with the kids teens we usually go to disneyworld for spring break but wanted to try something a little different this time we loved it so much attention to detail from the facade of the buildings to the cobblestone pathways they may have less land than in florida but they do so much more with it the rides are on a grander scale as well the pirate ride our favorite is so much longer than in orlando with little enjoyable not scary waterfalls i m a wimp loved it loved to see mr toad again and ride on a submarine the new california adventure adds so much to it all too world of color is amazing i would have given a star rating but the one area they re lacking in is food everything we had was less than impressive overpriced they no longer cater to people with food allergies only to those with celiac which is senseless since people with celiac can eat the gluten free egg free peanut free products that they used to carry not too magical for a kid to have to wrap his burger in lettuce instead of a bun i hope this will be changed in the near future ,4,2012-05-03
4549,a mom's perspective,there are so many reviews on disneyland that i thought i would write this review for moms of young kids my kids had a great time my kids are both into star wars but only one of them was old enough to do star tours the ride and the jedi training academy if your kids or you are into star wars i d encourage you to take the time to find out when the jedi training academy is being held that day and attend only some kids will get picked from the crowd they should stand up front for the best chance and get your camera video cameras ready it was great fun to watch star tours the ride was a really cool ride and i would recommend it to any star wars fan as long as they do not get motion sickness it was a lot of fun i would spend some time looking at the disney website to find out which rides your kids can go on measure your kids before your trip and also check out some frugal disney type websites for good family tips we brought food into the park in our backpack both days and i know that the guy checking our bag saw the food at least one of the days i ve heard that some employees ask you to get a locker for your food by the picnic area but they didn t make us do that we had some water sandwiches and pretzels and just having that little bit with us probably saved us a lot of money the bathrooms were kind of hard to find so i learned quickly to just ask an employee instead of wandering around i didn t ever see a family restroom but there are some low sinks for young kids and the baby changing area is built into a nook so much better than those flip down stations the bathrooms were pretty clean and employees are helpful i found that when you are getting pictures taken with characters if the disney photographer is there they are more than happy to take some shots with your camera don t be afraid to ask the disney photographers will take pictures for free and will have them online and you can choose to purchase them if you want with prices starting at per print download it was worth it for a couple of our pictures that didn t come out with our own cameras strollers are available for rent but i noticed as we entered the park that there was a sign saying you should rent your stroller prior to your visit i assume this is done online but we brought our own so it wasn t an issue the biggest piece of advice that i have is that the park is much less crowded in the middle of the week we went on a thursday friday and friday seemed much busier we decided to go on friday so that we could see the fireworks but unless you want to camp out for an hour or an hour and a half before the fireworks start not an option for antsy tired little kids or a mom who wants to make every minute count you will probably not get a good view the fireworks are really great but the view you want facing sleeping beauty s castle with the fireworks behind it is going to be taken by the people who save their spot an hour ahead of time if i had to do it again i would have gone on a tues or wed to beat the crowds ,4,2012-04-30
4550,Love Affair,growing up in southern california disneyland is a part of me both kids and adults love it whether you re going as a group of friends a couple a family or even for business you will have a good time they constantly have people going around to sweep and clean the entire staff is always friendly finally the rides are fun but never too extreme like other amusement parks cons tips going on the weekend or on a holiday can be difficult it s manageable but expect to get on fewer rides and wait a lot longer for them space mountain for example is usually a minute wait to get on also trying to get around right after fireworks or during a show can be very difficult they move large masses like a herd of sheep it s organized but can be very frustrating if you re the sheep finally if you re bringing a stroller never expect it to stay in one place if you park it and go on a ride especially during a show or preparation for shows parades fireworks chances are it might not be there when you get out disneyland staff will move the stroller to a different designated area if they need the area where the stroller was for something else so please don t freak out when you can t find it i ve seen so many parents think their stroller was stolen other tips use your ticket to get a fast pass to the rides with the longest lines also the bathroom by autopia is one of the cleanest finally it s the happiest place on earth so be patient it s an amusement park with tons of different people to get along with ,5,2012-04-30
4551,Disneyland Bliss-A Meal Recommendation,disneyland was wonderful of course why wouldn t it be but my review is simply a food recommendation that a well travlled disney friend showed me in california adventure just past toy story mania and going under the roller coater bridge above you is boardwalk pizza and pasta it is rather unassuming from the outside they place was empty inside but i highly recommend you go to the pasta station the chef hand fires each plate of pasta and it is amazing for i had one of the best pasta dishes i have ever tasted i had the wood fired tomato pesta pasta with chicken it is served in actual ceramic bowls with real silverware it was a lovely meal and i couldn t even begin to finish it all my friend also had a delicious pasta meal with a pizza for her daughter that looked like it had come from a high end restaurant this is a little gem for a great meal in such a amusement park atmosphere do try it ,5,2012-04-28
4552,Your inner child will thank you for it,to be perfectly honest i didn t really even care much to come here it wasn t a dream of mine as a child to go and i dont have children to take it was me and my partner taking up a good travel deal and disneyland tickets happened to be a part of it seriously it was the best fun just look at my display pic spinning teacups were the greatest couldn t control my face intense stuff we were like big kids the disney characters did a song and dance out the front of sleeping beauty s castle as we were walking towards it from main st usa and i could have cried from uncontrollable happiness it was like being oddly possessed by pure joy and innocence which i think was something different refreshing chicken soup for the soul kinda thing except for its a small world that was just creepy but i digress the time of year we went wasn t too busy at all which was surprising just off the peak season in sept and weather was beautiful not too hot where crowds are unbearable and cool at night after a big day still had a fireworks display on weekends only lines weren t too long at all probably the longest we had to wait was approx half an hour for the indiana jones attraction downside was the haunted mansion and space mountain were closed for repairs which we both really wanted to check out but that cant be helped and there is so much else to experience so we got over that in about seconds flat dont miss the pirates ride that was really cool food was ridiculously expensive so probably bringing food will make things cheaper and less time you ll have to wait in another line only to get a lacklustre overpriced burger we did the two parks in two days and did practically everything with children it might ve taken longer of course but if you re inner child inside is even slightly curious its worth getting a day pass to get the most out of it ,4,2012-04-27
4553,Happiest Place on Earth!,disney never disappoints as i just returned from my th trip to the magic kingdom the park is immaculate and the crew and cast members friendly and always looking to help and make your visit special we went on a thursday and the lines were manageable and since we downloaded the disney app on the iphone we always knew the wait times and were able to plan our day my cousins were visiting from thailand and were given st visit buttons which they wore proudly and were made to feel welcome by the park staff a great visit ,5,2012-04-25
4554,I just want to live there!!,wow how do you even begin to review disneyland i have been to plenty of theme parks but they all pale into insignificance compared to the happiest place on earth it is the phenomenal attention to detail that really makes it so amazing i think from the theming to the cleanliness pretty sure i saw rubbish taken away before it hit the ground from the constant atmosphere setting music in the background to the characters photo ops the rides were cool my personal faves included space mountain buzz lightyear astro blaster star tours but it was the total experience that really took my breath away over over again it is hard to believe that they do that fireworks display every night it was even cooler close to christmas as it finished with it snowing all over the park sooooo cool if i sound like a kid reviewing this it is probably because anyone who isn t a kid at disneyland is not breathing can t wait to go back ,5,2012-04-25
4555,Can't help but love Disney!,we were very fortunate to visit disneyland park in november because there were very few queues we didn t even have to use our fastpasses to get into the big attractions the only time we used it was to get into the indiana jones ride a second time just before it closed at pm a small world and pirates of the caribbean were closed disappointing but all the other attractions were open and waiting time to get in was usually about minutes only we had to queue for hours for space mountain in tokyo disneyland food is pricey so eat a huge high protein breakfast before you go and wear comfortable walking shoes because you ll be doing a lot of walking we highly recommend the three day disney pass because you can spend two days in disney and a day in california adventure which is worth visiting and do all the rides and see all the attractions without too much pressure we arrived when the park opened and left when it closed did our favorite rides twice and saw the lincoln attraction twice unmissable also enjoyed the opportunity to learn how to draw like the disney animators those free classes are so good not to be missed is ursula s cave where you have the opportunity to project your own voice onto a disney movie snippet of your choice either by singing or voice acting we had so much fun there and didn t want to leave it was a dream come true for our daughter we made lots of memories ,5,2012-04-24
4556,Loved Disneyland,am a frequent traveler to disneyworld and was very excited to visit disneyland for the first time thoroughly enjoyed it yes the castle is smaller that didn t bother me at all enjoyed comparing the similar rides big thumbs up for the land s versions of pirates small world and autopia very much enjoyed being able to ride mr toad again and visit toontown again as well as new rides such as indiana jones even my mother loved this one and storybook land canal boats we had a great time ,5,2012-04-23
4557,Never in July...,have been fortunate enough to visit florida disneyworld many times this was only the nd time visiting disneyland in anaheim calfornia was st week of july in can t remember the exat day was a tuesday or wednesday as i remember being told mid week was the slowest time as far a spark attendance we picked the hottest day of the week of our vacation to go if it was low attendance you certainly couldn t tell the park was packed too busy will never go again in july always previously had gone in the autumn to these kinds of theme parks when temps are cooler and attendanc eis really low lines for rides were really long in hours we got on rides including a minute wait alone for the revamped star tours ride that was an okay experience minute wait for a ride that lasted minutes yuck disneyland is awesome don t get me wrong some really good rides and such but avoid going in july at all costs ,3,2012-04-23
4558,Great to Visit But Very Busy!,we were so excited to go to disneyland as part of our honeymoon to the usa but as i think we may have gone in peak season it was very disappointing after visiting universal studios ofcourse the two attractions are quite different at disneyland we had to queue for atleast an hour for every ride attraction we wanted to go on if there was the option of purchasing a vip pass our trip would have been much better on the otherhand the disneyland hotel was fantastic and would highly recommend a stay there ,3,2012-04-18
4559,Disneyland Easter,on a california college tour road trip visiting from washington we planned to take a break on easter and enjoy the park we were anticipating large crowds due to the holiday and spring break but we were more than pleasantly surprised not only was the weather fabulous for the beginning of april the lines were just right we utilized early park entrance and fast passes but for the most part we were totally able to enjoy the day and see most everything in one day at the end of hours in the park we were popped but it was worth it ,5,2012-04-17
4560,Your Mileage May Vary,went to disneyland on april i travelled with a toddler so we have challenges on our own we needed to balance the ride s aggressiveness and the eligibility of his height for them his patience and ours were challenged at times with the availability of food that is not fried long lineups and wait times for various events such as the parades fantasmic and fireworks we had to prioritize since its only one day we got in this park one day is not enough if you plan on going on rides visiting the exhibits spend quality time in each of the other areas like tomorrowland main street usa toontown frontierland fantasyland the many souvenir shops various character experiences and slower pace tip as soon as you see something you really like buy it first you may not find this item elsewhere in the park if you do and its a lower price or you changed your mind you can returned this item later in the day at any of the other shops if you left the park and forgot to pick up something else you have another chance to buy more souvenirs at downtown disney s world of disney store most items can be had there as your second chance there are lots of stroller parking at every ride to park if you travel with little ones like me i would have preferred to rent a disney issued stroller there for than bring my mediocre umbrella stroller since theirs is more comfortable and hold more items than mine and i do not have to carry my own from the parking lot be prepared though to spend a lot of as you can only carry so much with you outside food allowed in is minimal since you are not allowed to bring in containers on wheels and you must put them in a locker outside the park entrance for to again experience is different for everyone and they cater to all ages worth a visit if you have not visited disney world prior to this ,4,2012-04-16
4561,Happiest place on Earth,disneyland was amazing we travelled with children aged years old and there was something for everyone we had the day park hopper passes and still did not see the whole park i recomend the bibbity bobbity boutique for anyone travelling with little girls they get pampered and get some lovely professional photo s to take home girls should come dressed as there favourite disney proncess and you have to book an appointment so i receomend going there forst thing in the morning to book your appointment for the day adults travelling as well and i think we had as much fun if not more than the kids definatly want to go back again one day ,5,2012-04-15
4562,What is there to say? It's a theme park!,my rd time to disney in years and thought i would write a review from a different perspective i didn t go on one ride or attraction this time we were a large touring group with people a variety of ages many people experienced the whole park others like myself were happy to get in and get out as quickly as possible there are new rides new parades and new experiences considering it was only spring break the lines were actually way longer to get onto a ride than peak season in june and july i would def avoid late march or early april if you re planning to go the grounds are clean staff everywhere but it didn t feel like happiest place on earth this time around it really was well over crowded with people pushing and shoving at every opportunity not really a pleasant stroll at all food is overpriced and sub standard and long lines to purchase anything took ages to view photos taken at the park at the photo shop the disney train lines were long with the ride itself taking longer than if you had to walk to your destination in the park hopper park tickets have gone up in price which if you re only going for or days and don t use the park to its full use don t offer value for money art shuttle buses generally take hour for the bus you need to get back to your hotel generally priced at for all day access which is good i won t be going back,3,2012-04-14
4563,Truly the happiest place on earth,this was my th trip to disneyland yes th and the magic is still going strong this time my husband and i travelled with our month old son my two brothers my parents and my inlaws one of the great things about disneyland is that there is something for all ages the staff are incredible it was especially evident this time with us having such a young child the cast members as they are called went out of their way to entertain our son while we were in line ups to get him to smile for photos and to direct us to the best spots for our stroller for shows etc the characters were incredibly good with our months old we never felt rushed and a few times we had characters stay longer then they were suppose to just so we could get a quick shot i think they really understand how special those moments are to us parents the shows are spectacular everything from fantasmic to the evening fireworks to billy hill the hillbillies even the street entertainers are great the current parade mickeys soundsational parade is alot of fun great soundtrack and one of the best parades i have seen in my many years as a visitor the food varies based on your price range and what your are interested in we enjoyed eating at the hungry bear several times because the food was good and the prices were reasonable we also love the chicken in the golden horseshoe another great food stop is a place in adventureland right across from the jungle cruise were you can get yummy meat skewers and warm pretzels we were there during canadian spring break and i was impressed at how short some of the lines were they really seemed to be trying to operate as many carts and vehicles as possible and when in doubt we just used the fastpast system which is a ticket you can get to return to the ride at a later time with little to no line up if you are going with young children do yourself a favor and get a day pass you really do need that time to enjoy the park to what it deserves we are already looking forward to our next visit in when our son will be cant wait to check out cars land ,5,2012-04-13
4564,Disneyland is the best,this place really is the happiest place on earth it might be a bit crowded and expensive but it is worth the full experience since disneyland offers something that no other place does it is fun for all ages and is great to go to anytime also if you are not too tired at closing time they do a fireworks show so thats cool ,5,2012-04-10
4565,Disneyland = Heaven,words cannot describe disneyland and the joy that it brings to myself and everyone i take there ,5,2012-04-10
4566,Spring Break 2012,i thought it would be to croweded to have fun the park was full but we got on all the rides we wanted to we had a blast don t let the time of year stop you from going its always so much fun,5,2012-04-09
4567,It's Disney!,if you re not happy at the happiest place on earth then give your head a shake i took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday and it was everything we had hoped it would be and more lines were long as we were here during the socal spring break this was my th time to the park and i have never waited so long to get on a ride however the cast members were great keeping morale up and being silly wonderful experience ,5,2012-04-08
4568,Always great Disney,it is always great the most fun you can have without breaking the law as usual it was exceptionally clean and everything is just good fun even the food is excellent and good value ,5,2012-04-08
4569,Disneyland 2012,my husband year old daughter i visited disneyland park disney california adventure over days tues thur during spring break i was a little concerned that we wouldn t be able to really enjoy the experience after hearing spring break is one of the busiest times of year but we had a fantastic time every single day we used a guide book to help prioritize and plan our days but once we got to the parks we just went with the flow we took advantage of the fastpass process and even on other rides never waited more than minutes for a ride at california adventure we started the day with breakfast with the princesses at ariel s grotto and ended the day with the prix fixe dinner at napa wine trattoria and reserved space for the world of color show while both of these dining experiences were pricey they were worth every penny our daughter loved meeting princesses and the food service at ariel s were great for breakfast and having the reserved space for the world of color was so nice overall i was pleasantly surprised at the prices of food merchandise at disneyland everything is always more expensive at a theme park but there was less sticker shock than expected my only complaint is that it seems like the on premise lodging options are ridiculously expensive though i understand we were there at prime season but it seems like disney world has such better deals but we loved every minute of disneyland and can t wait to go back to ride the matterhorn bobsleds my favorite ride as a kid which was closed due to renovation and also experience the new cars area at california adventure both will open on june ,5,2012-04-07
4570,Fantastic experience despite being the busiest time of year,disney knows how to offer something for everyone and to handle crowds well the attraction are well done the park is clean and the people are friendly worth a day or two at least ,5,2012-04-06
4571,Fun for any age,waiting minutes for a minute ride is ridiculous this was our last trip,5,2012-04-05
4572,Too crowded,disneyland is almost years old and it just keeps getting better there s not that much new there but if you haven t been in the past years you might enjoy the rebuilt submarine ride based on the finding nemo movie as well as the th anniversary showing of captain eo in d and the newly redesigned star tours ride the fireworks show is really great and unless you re planning on watching the fantasmic show right after the fireworks be sure to be in the central plaza area during the fireworks to see all the special effects that surround you there disney has become quite expensive but take advantage of the southern california resident discounts if you are eligible also don t forget the free all day coffee refills you can get if you buy a cup of coffee at the main street market house near the central plaza on the east side of main street they ve offered free refills since the park opened in it s not much but it s something also send yourself the free emailed photo of yourself on the astro blasters ride just look for the computer terminals at the end of the ride and don t forget to use your fast pass options wherever you can if the day is warm we like to head through adventureland when we first arrive and fast pass indiana jones on our way to splash mountain remember though that you can only get a fast pass for one ride at a time until the beginning time of your return period to your fast passed ride and unless you have a really large group or kids and you need to stay together take advantage of the singles line on splash mountain if there s just of you you often end up on the same boat log anyway and your wait is usually only a couple of minutes enjoy ,3,2012-04-04
4573,The Classic Still Rules,if you are anywhere near socal get the annual pass it s much more fun to come for hours than to pay a lot for the one day pass and try to see everything even when you and your kids are tired and sunburned ,5,2012-04-01
4574,Intolerable lines.,it s disneyland they do such a great job of maintaining the park and keeping the lines moving and the shows were spectacular ,3,2012-04-01
4575,Hello??? It's the happiest place on earth.,disney world is a to at the most a star atrraction which is fine but it is grossly overrated dineyland is better in every respect other than the sad fact we live on the east coast and the land is on the west coast disneyland unlike the world if you stay close enough you can actaually walk in off the street instead of fighting lanes of potentially aggressive drivers and paying a ridiculous amount of money to park your vehicle the rides are at least as good as the world the food is as good as at the world but there is less hype and confusion the world has the attitude of we are the best which gets old fast on our family s opinion the land is the best ,5,2012-03-30
4576,One of my favorite places on earth!,i have deluxe annual passes i visit frequently as i own a travel agency and i specialize in disney trips so i always stay up to date on all that is happening at the happiest place on earth plan your visit asap ,5,2012-03-26
4577,Disneyland Overrated.,this year my family visited disneyland for the fifth time we go every two years and as always it was awesome it helped we went at a less busy time but there were still a lot of people for me i don t mind waiting in lines as long as they re under minutes and that wasn t a problem with the exception of a few rides which we were able to do at early entry if you can get in as soon as the park opens and have a early lunch to avoid long lines take advantage of fast pass and single rider entrances disneyland is constantly creating new things and making things even better if possible the only ride that was closed in disneyland proper not including california adventure was the matterhorn which i don t go on anyway my favourite rides include pirates of the caribbean autopia peter pan s flight it s a small world and so many more the park was very clean and well kept with very friendly and positive staff even though no one in my family is in a wheelchair i noticed the staff took excellent care of those who were and the rides are more wheelchair friendly than you may think it is possible to go to disneyland with children in strollers you can rent a stroller for a per day fee i recommend waiting until your child ren are at least four years old to avoid the pain of having to push and park your stroller in a crowded place another reason to wait until your children are a little older is because there is a fair amount of walking involved as well as patience we went to the fireworks show it was my first time seeing it and it was spectacular with the castle in the foreground it was basically magical the way they choreographed it with the music like having green lasers and saturn shaped fireworks during the star wars music there were so many cool effects fire amazing as for characters there were a fair share of the classic characters mickey minnie pluto etc but i advise you start heading in their direction as soon as you see them come out because there are usually quite long lines for them unfortunately with the addition of pixie hollow and the royal princess fair a tent where you wait in line to meet four princesses fairies i never saw any princess characters around which took away some of the surprise satisfaction of finding the character without waiting in a minute line although it isn t a big deal for me because i am more into riding the rides still a great experience hope to go again in two years ,2,2012-03-26
4578,BEST PLACE EVER!,what a great park loved our day here in our opinion its better than disneyland orlando same named rides like spacemountain big thunder rail road splash mountain but different to the ones in orlando loved space monutain sitting side by side and a far smoother ride than the one in orlando splash mountain was different better too we spent way more time in this disneyland park than the other well worth a visit,5,2012-03-25
4579,One word.....Fantastic!,amazing place loved every minute of it children couldn t get enough of disney and neither could we fire works fantastic and the world of colour amazing i think we should ve had more time we had days and didn t get to do everything but saw most of it good time of year to go not lots of crowed on thursday and friday and the last day was sunday that was busy,5,2012-03-24
4580,A must do vacation!!,loved it so much we are going back in june traveling with an autistic child to disneyland made me a bit nervous but the cast members are so accommodating ,5,2012-03-24
4581,I Love Disneyland,hated standing in line when i had to but it s worth it i absolutely love disneyland it is out of this world ,5,2012-03-12
4582,Loved Disneyland,i would move in and live here it is truly one of the best places on earth ,5,2012-03-12
4583,There is no other place like Disneyland,once again disneyland continues to delight us i have been going for about years and although i like some of the same older attractions i am disappointed that disney continues to raise prices and get every they can i would like for disney to try an experiment for one day cut the price of everything in the park in more people would buy things and i think they would not lose out on much revenue for an x picture with x s more people might buy the package if it was how much does it cost them to make those pictures more people might buy them if they were more reasonably priced it just seems like every time i go the prices keep going up but i still keep going back going on a monday tuesday and wednesday on off season is the best time to go ,5,2012-03-09
4584,"Love it, Love it, Love it",every person must go to disneyland australian family who went to disneyland in dec and then returned in nov dec we spend the second time about six days on and off at the park one of those days turned into a hour day at the park i love disneyland old or young who cares there is something for everyone will be back again and again and again ,5,2012-03-09
4585,One of the MUST DO attractions in California,i went there with my wife initially we thought it is for small children only but once we entered and we were like in another world cartoon world it has two different parks disneyland theme park am to am and adventure park am to pm theme park is really huge and it has different or sub parks with different theme it is not possible to complete entire theme park in one day i would suggest first to attend todays and tomorrow land since it has very good rides evening parade was really amazing and very attractive don t miss it fireworks at around pm are also amazing i would suggest finding a good place from where you can have very good view of fireworks there are also many cartoon characters available to take photo graph with mickey mini pluto etc i would suggest using fast pass very well so you can utilize your time effectively adventure park is comparatively small and can be finished in day there are many rides to do i really big liked roller costar there white river rifting aladdin show twilight lift ride are must and very amazing best part is fountain show in the evening i have never seen this kind of show anywhere in the world if you are visiting california then you can t miss disney land ,5,2012-03-05
4586,Happiest Place On Earth!,i like almost everything about disneyland except the hours and the max capacity if not for those two things i d give this a rating of instead of there are times at disneyland during the spring and summer that you can t move three feet without invading someone else s personal space the population of the world is getting bigger people are traveling more so it would be nice if they would stop cramming us in like sardines just to make a buck i d even be willing to pay more for admission if it would guarantee me some breathing room as far as the hours winter hours are a total bummer they re just not open long enough when the young kids are being toted off to beddy bye us older kids would like to enjoy some of the rides and not have to wait in quite as excruciatingly long lines people shouldn t be punished for not taking vacation during the summer also hot and miserable on top of over crowded ,4,2012-03-04
4587,My Favorite Place!,there are always changes happening but it is still so clean and exciting be sure to check out astro blasters in tomorrow land and email your picture home at the end ,5,2012-03-03
4588,5th trip and still the Happiest place on Earth!,overcrowded people take cuts in long lines and seem to be plain rude moms with strollers are dangerous ,5,2012-03-02
4589,too many people!,just by way of information we visited most recently on the st th of february the st and nd were blissfully slow the rd was quite busy and the th was a bit slower i can t imagine ever ranking disneyland below a if you don t have fun you re not doing it right that being said if you don t like crowds and spending money you might want to skip it but take it all for what it is go with the flow and have fun even though i ve visited disneyland dozens of times i discovered something on our recent trip thanks to a wonderfully helpful cast member that i wanted to pass along my daughter loves the characters but when and where can you see them there are cast members with little badges that say ask me about characters they have a schedule and can tell you who will be where and at what time it was so helpful to know where we could find chip and dale or cinderella without having to hunt them down also save your feet from all the walking by grabbing a ride on the railroad or one of the carts or bus on main street usa ,2,2012-03-02
4590,Construction,matterhorn was shut down for refurbishment that will take almost as long as building the empire state building alot of people and waiting and the food there is not good we went to bakery and they would not warm up our croissant nor could we get a breakfast sandwich coffee there is no good but it was nice to see the place that walt built but he would not approve on the greed every ride ends up at a gift shop filled with chinese made crap can disney afford to have things made here ,3,2012-02-26
4591,Feels small & dated compared to Disneyworld,hate to say it but we were really disappointed in disneyland compared to our experiences at both disneyworld and on a disney cruise the facilities felt dated and small compared to the florida park and more importantly that famous disney magic was missing we saw very few characters circulating and interacting with guests there was no sense of having arrived at a special place when you walk in the front gates where very few staff are in evidence and in general staff did not have the usual outgoing disney friendliness and helpful attitude there were lines which we certainly expected but we were disappointed that the fast track ticket times were hours out which often meant we wouldn t be able to hang around with small kids long enough to use them all in all i would not return here whereas we ll certainly visit disneyworld again ,3,2012-02-25
4592,Losing it's appeal........,we just returned from our third trip to disney which is likely to be our last we went away very disappointed disney has really gone downhill over the past years the crowds are getting ridiculous and they need to figure out a way to scale down the number of people they are letting in to the park these people shell out a lot of money to be there only to get in to find out rides aren t running wait times are over an hour for the ones that are meals and drinks are highway robbery etc it s just stupid already and i d say far from being the happiest place on earth it s a sweaty stomping mosh pit standing in lineups is the name of the game these days figure out the cost per ride and it s just so not worth it anymore they have people directing foot traffic yelling at guests where to walk for no reason i d understand if there was something special going on in that area but there generally never was we felt like herded cattle we actually joked that the next time we come they ll be using cattle prods to direct people it s gotten that bad one thing i d like to know is why a place designed for families why are the bathrooms so well hidden we spent one day at universal and one day at knott s berry farm and we had a million times more fun because we actually felt like we got some value for our money both of which are way cheaper than disney we saw tons of other characters at these parks dora the explorer shrek woody woodpecker charlie brown snoopy the list goes on and on rode tons of rides some we rode multiple times watched lots of shows etc etc most of all we enjoyed our days there of the three days we spent at disney we didn t really enjoy one of them seems like disney has become far more fixated on profit than anything these days shame ,2,2012-02-25
4593,"Fun, Fabulousness and Fairy Tales",it s february after president s day but whew the crowds are alive at disneland and thank heavens they ve re done harbor blvd since the last time you were there and you have simply got to follow the other cars to find out where to park heavens if you d stayed at the nearby candy cane inn or other right close by properties you would have found it even more difficult to walk to the entrance not to mention confusing in the dark at thend of the day so again thank heavens for crowds following cars and learning that a u turn or two can be a good thing as you enter the disney parking lot park your car use your sell phone and snap a pic of the escalator level you re parked on and then get going the free tram takes you to the front entrance of the park stand in a quick moving line and buy a ticket if you haven t gotten yours yet make sure you bring photo id to match your credit card though throughout the park this will be necessary as you make your credit card purchases tomorrowland remains one of the busiest sections of the park especially after e sun ges down all e adults are hoping it is quieter and they flock to the attractions there toontown is one of the lesser visited as is fantasyland enjoy the rides be patient in the lines and consider learning more about the fast pass system if you have limited time to spare do an internet search for disney fast pass to learn more tips dress in layers morning and evening can be cool wear bring hat or sunglasses but don t be afraid to buy same at the park prices are about the same as you d pay at a dept store if you need a shirt shorts sunglasses hats etc in fact you might be overwhelmed with all the shopping options i know i was bring your camera of course and take advantage of gorgeous gardens exotic plants and colorful settings day and night consider doing half a day resting at your hotel and returning in the evening or next day to enjoy other attractions and don t hate on the canoe attraction after all that good food some real exercise is a welcome challenge its not as easy as it looks either watch out for stroller mania literally thousands of strollers parked everywhere or being pushed everywhere by exhausted or distracted parents and if it is your real birthday let them know they ll give you a special button to wear disney employees and guests alike will greet you with happy birthday all day long it s so fun even after all these years happiest apace on earth yes a resounding yes ,5,2012-02-24
4594,Excellent Park HORRIBLE CROWDS!!!!,we go to disneyland almost every year this was the first year we went on a weekend with it being february i assumed it wouldnt be too bad boy was i wrong the rides were fantastic as always but hard to enjoy with min wait times would i go again absolutely just never again over presidents day weekend or any weekend for that matter ,5,2012-02-23
4595,Disney vacation,can t really beat disney when you go for an amusement park getaway lines were outrageous on a holiday weekend but expected fast pass is a must ,4,2012-02-21
4596,cheap tickets AT Disney,for my surprise tickets were per person per day for one park i was willing to pay them but in the official disney parking lot they were selling ticket for less dollars each tax included the ones in the web page i ignore if tax was or not included have fun,5,2012-02-20
4597,Annual Pass,sorry disney world lovers but california is the place to be walt put many special touches in this park and there are actually more rides here more i believe the weather is awesome never got out of the s in mid july ,5,2012-02-20
4598,"The original the park, the best theme park!",my best tips for visiting disneyland park go early in the morning magic morning in the park is so peaceful and worth it that was probably the best part of the whole experience for my husband and i also be sure to utilize the fast passes but remember that you cannot hold more than for the same time go during the week if you must go on the weekend as we had to do the most popular rides or at least the ones you don t want to miss before am after am the park starts to get packed and the evenings are not much better overall it can be the happiest place on earth if you take your time to enjoy it don t stress out and rush because that is no way to create very good memories ,5,2012-02-19
4599,"Terrorized by Long Lines, Archaic Rides, Insulting Prices",we took an hour drive down from northern california and stayed at a nice hotel across the way from disney we traveled in early february and were horrifiyingly shocked at the super long lines through out both parks we went on a thursday friday saturday thursday and friday were packed but saturday was an un godly zoo the lines were ridiculously long on all days we live near marine world in northern ca and have never waited more than minutes for any ride ever waiting minutes for each ride is simply exhausting for a small bottle of water and to rent a single stroller we thought that arriving in the off season would save us the crowds and terror wrong i consulted with a park attendant who divulged that between the parks they will let in nearly people in a single day my husband and i both took a stroller and spent long days navigating through the sea of humanity as my husband put it we finally realized that in order to get the best experience you have to shell out the dough we spent on a lunch at ariels grotto you have to pay a flat rate fee it was really fun for our daughter to get personal attention from each princess but the childrens meals were terrible they put dry fishy crackers on top of our daughters cheese shells she did not eat a single bite i finally gave up trying to get either child to eat any of their lunch and asked the server to bring out the desert tray the kids gobbled down the grapes and cookies which is the only they could stomach in the place also we were told that anyone would be happy to take a photo of us when the photo guy came to deliver us a hyper inflated photo of our daughter with ariel he rolled his eyes when we asked him to take a photo of us really on saturday it got very cold outside and we had to shell out for sub quality hoodies for our kids note anything in the park is going to be times the usual retail price in a normal store bring as much food water and layers of clothes into the park as possible actually my advice would be to not go at all go to a smaller park and you will enjoy yourselves much more ,2,2012-02-15
4600,Awesome,disneyland is just amazing our travel agent told us days was ample how wrong she was we needed full days here to see and enjoy it all the night parade has me in tears it was so magical cannot wait to return to this happy happy place spotless and very well organised well done america ,5,2012-02-15
4601,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!,we visit wdw florida so much and had the wonderful opportunity to go to disneyland in feb had such a wonderful experience we love disney and this did not disappoint in any way it was fun to compare wdw and dlr both are awesome but very different dlr seemed quaint loved that i didn t have to do much walking to enjoy the park ,5,2012-02-14
4602,Great Vacation...,soaring over california the parade the princess breakfast the world of color is a must pirates of the carribean was fun the hotel hot tub could be hotter ,5,2012-02-08
4603,Another great Disney Park,we went to disneyland for the first part of our honeymoon since we have been to disney world a couple of times i knew going in that it wouldn t be fair to compare the two parks because of size and by keeping that in mind we had a great time i was so excited that space mountain was open that we rode it twice in a row and i loved our private cruise around the world i ve come to expect top notch service and cleanliness in disney parks and disneyland didn t disappoint ,5,2012-02-06
4604,Fun and Magical but no where as big as Disneyworld,we were in disneyworld in april since we loved it so much decided to go to disneyland in january traveled with hubby year old and year old my year old enjoyed it much more this time around my daughter year old loved it so much especially the princesses i liked disneyland for the fact that it is smaller than disneyworld less walking less busy as well what i didnt like about it is that they had so many time restrictions like they dont have fireworks everynight instead they had it only on the weekends and one of the nights they had to cancel it due to the wind also they only have a parade at night during the weekdays in addition the hours of the park are much less than disneyworld they are only open from am to pm during the weekdays while on the weekend they are open from am to am i remember in disneyworld they were open longer than that also my daughter didnt get to see all the princesses this time because the only photo taking they have is with princesses at a time and its up to luck to see which princesses are there at that time if you re in line waiting for a particular princesses she might leave by the time you get to the front of the line overall we had a great time love disney but honestly i think next time we will go back to disneyworld ,4,2012-02-04
4605,Wonderful,had a great time the family loved it my son spent his th birthday at disneyland received a birthday badge from city hall and spent the day feeling extra special everything was great the rides staff and food highly recommend the bbq ribs and chicken from the frontierland i would recommend planning your day and trying to do the popular rides early in the day as they get busy downside people cutting into the lines very rude days disneyland day california adventure park a great couple of days and it really is the happiest place on earth,5,2012-02-01
4606,Avoid holiday weeks. The crowds are too much.,we went january thinking that the crowds would have been less wrong every day we got to the park when it opened to maximize what we could do and every day the crowds were so bad by pm that we gave up for the day we would collect as many fastpasses as we could early in the day so when the crowds got bad we could do a few more rides by pm the fast pass return time was often midnight and the wait times were minutes for the big rides that means that even the less popular rides often had wait times over minutes so days in the park and we actually did about half of what i thought we would do because the lines were always so bad ,3,2012-01-31
4607,the happiest place on earth,loved it had to wait in line for some rides most waits were no longer minutes not to bad considering it was christmas time love space mountain indiana jones peter pan ride splash mpuntain big bear mountain in fact loves every single ride every single moment at disney,5,2012-01-27
4608,Great park,this was a fun park though if you have been to magic kingdom you will be surprised at how small the castle is many great coasters and also family rides for the kids love space mountain especially that it is side by side seating unlike orlando this is the second time we went in january great time to go no lines we didn t even fast pass anything ,4,2012-01-24
4609,Disney Line Ups,can you say line ups our first and only visit to disney land yes we had fun when we were not lined up waiting for long periods of time trouble is more than half our time was spent in lines waiting waiting the shows were fun the rides were fun the prices for goods is extreme we will not ever be going back it s to crowded and some of the staff seemed to be hard pressed to smile and be pleasant only good thing glad we didn t go at peak time of year now that would of really been a drain on our time ,3,2012-01-23
4610,When you wish upon a star...,amazing no negatives the holidays at disneyland are incredible the parks are usually packed with guests but a great getaway from the california sunshine,5,2012-01-23
4611,Disney Holidays,most rides are great but they ruined star tours it s not worth the wait spend the time waiting for indiana jones instead ,4,2012-01-22
4612,The Happiest Place on Earth,this place has great things to offer especially for families with young children we bought the day park hopper pass because we wanted to see both the disneyland parks i enjoyed the disneyland park a lot better than the disneyland adventure may be because my kid is too young for the rides loved the prade and fireworks and also there pirate show at night truly awesome and highly recommended i recommend going there around noon and staying late its open till midnight since most activities are commenced in the evening wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for a lot of fun dont forget your camera if you have younger children dont waste money on the park hopper pass and stick with original disneyland ,5,2012-01-21
4613,They ruined Star Tours,lots of fun rides super clean and lots to do for everyone ,4,2012-01-17
4614,Gotta go!,i have been to disneyland at least times since i was a small child and i still love it even though i know all the rides like the back of my hand they still are so much fun to me the lines were longer than i remember but that is ok love it still ,5,2012-01-10
4615,Truly the happiest place on earth,i want to say that i love disneyland that it was the best place to go that my kids loved it we saw everything got on the rides and truly enjoyed ourselves but i cannot say any of that we went years ago when our kids were babies and we waited almost years and were told that we have to go during christmas you have to see the fireworks and snow well later with alot of planning and budgeting the fireworks were cancelled so was the snow if you can actually get to an employee they told us very different stories about why we still do not know why we were so dissapointed sadly i believe our days are up it was insane some people said on here to get there early get fastpasses get in line early have a plan i sooooo hear you we did this only because we booked it already and paid and then were told last minute that we were in for pure chaos and crowds i tell you we did lots of rides did the fast passes got there early but our kids hated it so did we i never plan to have to plan my vacation like that again i only did it because of the money we spent but it was crazy long lines crazy people you couldn t see anything just exhausting and tiring we could not wait to get back to our hotel and that is sad we were there to see disneyland and all we wanted to do was get the heck out of there ,5,2012-01-07
4616,Castle not as pretty as Florida but everything else compares,loved it liked as much as florida one better thing was that you can walk to disneyland park california adventure and downtown disney ,5,2012-01-02
4617,Way too many people,will never go there again during any holiday the wait time on some of the rides were minutes fast passes helped a little and the early one day entry was good we went on rides before the crowds became overwhelming ,3,2012-01-01
4618,Definately not for children only,i was reluctant to go to disneyland as i thought is was for kids oh how wrong i was i have now been to disneyland times as well as the one in hong kong it really makes you revert back to your childhood the rides are fabulous as is the parade and fireworks the food and souvenirs are over priced so make sure you go with a pocket full of cash use the fastpass option where available as the wait can be really long for some rides tip go to walmart in the anaheim area they have heaps of disneyland product for a eighth of the price and they have a huge variety to choose from in fact there is more there than at disneyland itself ,5,2012-01-01
4619,Magical Experience,disneyland was amazing and definitely met perhaps even exceeded our expectations while there are no really thrilling rides there are a few decent ones that we enjoyed such as space mountain and splash mountain i love the detail put into everything ,5,2011-12-31
4620,"Great Place, but everybody knows that!",never been at christmas thought it would be nice to see the park all decorated decorations were fantastic fireworks show cheesy magical snowing on mainstreet was surprising watching the famous candy cane being made awesome and then realizing our standing in line at am to get one was worth it the holiday lay over on small world was great and this time we added the holiday tour enjoyed some rides music information hot chocolate gingerbread fudge and the best seats for the parade we also added the discover the magic tour enjoyed some rides found clues had a frozen sweet treat and loved our personal time with mickey mouse at the end of the treasure hunt great tour guides tours cost extra so be prepared to pay for three people two tours with such crowds during this time i would suggest going to the park monday friday with tuesday being the best day take advantage of early morning entry and be in line at least one hour prior to the early morning entry time use the fastpass system to avoid long lines i was always making sure we had a stack of fastpasses to use had a great time ,5,2011-12-30
4621,Disneyland is fantastic,we took my year old niece for the first time on her birthday which was during thanksgiving weekend i was really surprised and happy that there wasn t so many people there we got there around and by noon we had already gotten on rides as it got later the longs got longer but it wasn t your normal weekend crowd toon town on the other hand was packed we got our spots for the christmas parade and lighting of its a small world and we had an awesome spot the kids were able to see everything and enjoy without having anyone blocking their view i also loved that the rides were running till exactly midnight we were able to enjoy rides in the last ten minutes then we got to shop a little and didn t even leave disneyland till close to am the cast members on the nemo submarine ride really made my nieces night all day she had a birthday pin on and no one really said anything but when we were in line the two gentlemen running the ride at the time made sure to let everyone know that it was her birthday they had everyone in line sing happy birthday to her and she was smiling from ear to ear they were able to get first timers pins for both my niece and nephew but had ran out of the birthday pins to make up for not having the pin they decided to give her some special passes for a ride they really went above and beyond our family was bummed that we missed the snow from my understanding and past experience they usually do the snow immediately following the parade so we waited around but they didn t so we walked away ten to fifteen minutes after the parade had already finished we were in line for its a small world and they started releasing the snow the kids were a little upset that they didn t get to take a picture in the snow at disneyland overall we had a great trip disneyland is definitely the happiest place on earth and made the kids first time experience a memorable one ,5,2011-12-30
4622,New Experiences,this is walt disneys park and you can still feel the magic touch he gave to his big dream the park is small but very well made if you have been to disney world you will understand that what you see in one area of that park is nearly the size of this park it has some different things than disney world which are great space mountain in disneyland is better than the one in disney world haunted mansion is also better redone to a nightmare before christmas now disney world is just regular i really enjoyed this park though i must say that the staff in this park is not as good as the ones in disney world not many smiles except the older people that know why they work there to create magic and world class service a lot of the younger staff are not smiling using their cellphones not greeting hands in pockets etc need to be better coached the fireworks was disappointing disney world s magic kingdom is so much better and you couldn t really see the fireworks good enough from main street some places ,5,2011-12-16
4623,Disneyland is great for everyone!!!,my family and i visited disneyland on november th which was also my youngest daughter s st birthday my son flew in from germany where he is serving in the army to spend the day with his sister which was great surprisingly the crowds weren t too bad for a sunday after thanksgiving and the park looked beautiful all dressed up in christmas season gala however the big problem was how consistent rides broke down while we rode them this has never been an issue at disneyland as it had been at other parks visited but on this visit indiana jones ride broke down for minutes while on the ride the lights turned on so you could see the interior of the building how disappointing then the haunted mansion broke down for about minutes followed by tower of terror this time because someone let their feet fly high off the ground only to be kicked off the ride then peter pan anyway it wasn t the typical disneyland visit and quite frankly perhaps it is showing its age ,5,2011-12-16
4624,2 Days wasn't long enough,we flew over from australia and stayed at the disneyland hotel so that we could just dedicate days to the theme parks it ended up being just rds of our time at the disneyland side and very little time at the adventure park our first day at disneyland was a shock i had never seen so many strollers i don t see why so many babies get taken to disney they won t even remember it was like endless fields of strollers anyways people do what they do i have been to lots of theme parks and i had never seen lines so long the fast pass system is on most rides but not all and the more popular rides fast pass is the only way you will get to see them on the monday we went to the star tours attraction the line was min wait and the fast pass was telling people to come back at pm most of the time i spent at disney was waiting in line we rode most of the rides and indiana jones one was one of the better ones it did break down after mins wait and we came back later apparently it always breaks so be aware space mountain was great as well the star wars one is just your standard d simulator nothing new there the haunted mansion was a pleasant surprise with its christmas theme i saw the halloween character all day around his ride however to get a photo with any other character seems impossible i saw micky after a min wait at his house minnie i caught but she was finishing up and goofy in the hotel but that was it for the characters for whole days i intended to get a photo with all of them but there is no way it can be done in days in the other park i saw woody once its not the impression you get from the commercial put it that way the very last attraction i visited was the big redeemer the world of colour watershow this made the trip worthwhile immediately spectacular can t stress the importance of seeing this show enough get a fast pass and camp out early for a good standing spot my advice in summary skip disney and get over to universal studios for better rides more characters way less crowds and get a vip pass to skip the lines get a discount at all the shops and free awesome food ,3,2011-11-23
4625,Don't go to Halloween Party if invited,we went here with family and friends who were staff and had won tickets our yr old was so looking forward to the visit and couldn t wait to trick and treat she got dressed up in a spider oufit with a nice little pumpkin trick and treat bag eager to get some sweets our friends had told us we could enter the park at pm so we arrived at pm only to discover we couldn t enter until pm then we discovered we couldn t enter until pm as they were empting the park of the normal public so we could enter this took forvever i don t know what disney were thinking of from doing this as it was a school night for american children and pm most kids would be getting ready for bed our little one was agitated tired and eager to enter the park when they finally let us in the gates we had to wait at main street for another minutes well our little one was asleep by then and who could blame her she missed everything she was eager to do and see all day so we just had our dinner and left disgusted with disney for this event ,1,2011-11-22
4626,Dream come true,well this was a dream come true for us forget the other members it was me who was very excited to visit the place the cartoon characters whom i have grown up with it is advisable to purchase the tickets through the tour operators as it would be cheaper to include both entry ticket cost transportation we started from la and after appr couple of drives reached the location there was huge queue at the entrance and we managed to enter after waiting for over mins once we entered inside wow goofy and minnie were there to welcome us there are plenty of things activities in the park which could keep you engaged for a very long time and one is oblivious to the time at the entrance there is a small museum which details the history of walt disney with disneyland growing there is the train ride in the park outer circle which take you around the entire place it is advisable to carry the park map with you and plan the trip accordingly do not miss out the parade and the wonderful laser show in the evening during our stay in la we went twice to be completely engrossed and allured to the disneyland the original birthplace of mickey mouse donald duck and uncle scrooge ,5,2011-11-10
4627,Amazing Place to Visit!!,my wife and i took our children ages and on our first family trip it was a great choice very magical and perfect for us we went from early morning to late night every day for days the kids and parents loved it yes it is expensive to eat in the park but we would leave and go across the street to eat the shows were amazing and even if the lines were long you were always moving we are definitely going back ,5,2011-11-08
4628,"Great fun for all ages, just don't visit in the weekend.",october weekdays were ok but i have visited twice in may and the queues didn t seem so long it is worth using fast pass if you are organised enough we bought a southern california pass which included a day park hopper days at universal studios seaworld and san diego zoo very good value do take advantage of early entry day on the park hopper ticket stay at one of the motels across the road there are plenty in close walking distance ,5,2011-11-01
4629,Great time,we had a great time best suggestion for eating is to take the monorail out to downtown disney the food selection and price is much better if you have a chance get the park hopper and go to california adventure too finally get the photo pass every time they take your photo on a ride or in the them parks they are uploaded to this card you can later order a cd of all your images for only ,4,2011-11-01
4630,Love the park!,i heard disneyland is smaller and not as much fun as disney world but i don t think that s the case my daughter loved it and i felt it was easier to get around and friendlier in that sense than the many parks of disney world hit all the parades and fireworks shouldn t be missed also was able to go to the halloween party if timing works go for it ,5,2011-11-01
4631,"First timer, but definitely not last!",i thought this would be my one and only time out there as i usually go to orlando but i was so impressed that i definitely will go back obviously is is in no way the grand scale of disney world but it was a refreshing change of pace i love the proximity of everything and the ease of getting around in short time some of the rides were definitely better here ie it s a small world haunted mansion holiday and some stuff ie crowd control parades could not compare to orlando i really enjoyed it more than i thought and liked some stuff so much that i am bummed it isn t available in orlando the weekend time was a nightmare for crowds but come the weekdays it became a relaxing experience space mountain was wait all weekend but diring the week it was under mins i love all things disney and can t wait to visit again ,5,2011-10-31
4632,Disney is the leader for a reason.,i went on a friday with my wife and year old we stayed from around noon till pm this was our first visit pros well staffed with plenty of beverage and snack carts some great sit down dining options very clean the new star wars simulator is terrific fastpass can reduce wait times if you get them early great shuttle service to the parking lot it s disney kids will love it cons long lines even in october for the best rides star wars and space mountain sold out of fast passes early and it leads to a wait of minutes star wars line needs to have permanent shade installed as the sun is strong hard to locate parking wow are there a lot of people on scooters in this park watch your step adults and teens will enjoy the california adventure park more not as magical as disneyworld,4,2011-10-31
4633,Fun for any age!,this was our second trip within months thanks in part to the low us canadian exchange rate the first time we werent very happy with the hotel menage this time we decided to stay elsewhere and it was perfect we stayed at the marriott residence inn and it was perfect the thing to remember with disneyland that unless you are willing to pay a premium and stay at either the disneyland hotel grand californian closest and practically inside california adventure or at paradise pier the least expensive of the you are in for a bit of a walk parking on the other hand is fairly reasonable and my favorite parking lot is the toy story lot comfortable shuttles take you to and from the park and operate constantly we never had to wait for a shuttle there was always one waiting the thing to remember inside the park is to use the fast pass it is free and saves you slot of time especially during peak park times do not miss the world of colour a free and amazing show in the california adventure park note you will get wet especially if you are in the yellow or red sections and be prepared to stand for a long period of time as they corral you in to the sections almost an hour ahead of the show and there is no seating ariel s grotto which allows your child to meet the princesses is overpriced and the food is not good in my opinion the face of my daughter however priceless when the princesses interested with her and on to of a lunch the photo was still great though it would have been nice to be included the rides are the real attraction and both disney and california adventure does not disappoint on the disneyland side my favorites these are the ones i would ride more than once are star tours space mountain the matterhorn bobsleds the teacups the disney railroad indiana jones buzz lightyear blasters splash mountain and pirates of the caribbean in california adventure toy story goofys sky school soaring over california the family favorite the ferris wheel zeppelin and ariels undersea adventure a tip for parents old enough to drink there are the best margaritas served in california adventure ,5,2011-10-31
4634,Massive,be prepared spent days there and still did not see everything great place for the kids and the walking well its a good way to keep fit best time to go is late morning when people are heading back to their hotels for lunch i will be back again to see more next year ,5,2011-10-26
4635,What can I say...it is DISNEYLAND!,my parents first brought me to disneyland the year it opened and it has been an important tradition for celebrating birthdays graduations and for making unexpected free days special other amusement parks in socal have faster and scarier rides but disneyland has an ambiance and thrill not duplicated in any of the other parks well worth the trip ,5,2011-10-26
4636,Awesome place for kids of all ages,travelled on the trip of a lifetime with family october and was not disappointed disneyland lived up to all our varied expectations from the moment we walked in we were impressed by the cleanliness of the place the upkeep of all rides facilities and shops the staff were brilliant friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble weekdays in october had less crowds gets very busy on weekends but not as bad as we had anticipated food was ok attractions first rate attended minnie and friends breakfast which was sensational a heap of characters for the children to get autographs and photos and the first was good and we were not rushed out of there a must see are the parades twice a day and the fireworks on weekends tip get to the right side of the castle so the trees don t get in the way of your photos if you can do a train ride early to get a good layout of the park and where the rides and crowds are a wonderful experience and a must do on anyone s list we too are also planning our next visit had a five day hopper ticket and never got tired or bored on one day we entered the park at am and left at midnight ,5,2011-10-19
4637,Disneyland - Great Family Trip,as a aussie family we visited disneyland at anaheim on and sep and had a massive awesome time being guests at the disney s paradise pier hotel we were able to get in an hour earlier than the public and on one day attended the toontown parade only available to disney hotel guests where toontown mayor mickey granted us all honourary citizens of toontown and the kids were also able to take photos with a whole heap of characters like mickey minnie chip dale goofy pluto etc the kids also enjoyed breakfast with minnie and her friends at the plaza inn although the meal was too sweet for a breakfast the many rides kept the kids and us busy and we were also happy with the short queues as we visited in september our first ride was memorable space mountain the haunted house was really scary no way quite tame actually had a photo of our year old daughter riding in the tram car with a bored face it was definitely a well worth family experience and one we would recommend to all famiilies the disney staff were all very friendly and helpful especially with us first time visitors no question was too difficult really make our stay and visit a great one a big thanks to all disney staff ,5,2011-10-17
4638,We had the best vacation ever!!,i had been to disneyland twice before about yrs ago and yrs ago but this was the first visit for my husband and our year old son we loved everything about it the rides were great pirates was closed which we were bummed about but we had checked the website and knew that before we went we enjoyed most of the food and the halloween time atmosphere added to the magic of it we also went to the halloween party which was totally worth it ,5,2011-10-16
4639,It's still the Happiest Place On Earth!,back to disneyland at and still just as fun as when i was young the rides are great the lines not too bad the day we went only minute wait for the matterhorn parade was nice and had a fun day went on all the e ticket rides except pirates which was closed haunted mansion was decorated for halloween ,5,2011-10-16
4640,The Place Where Dreams Come True,they don t call disneyland magical for no reason there is so much to do here the park is so big so many rides so many games so many special friends for children and parents alike dreams come true all over it takes more than a day to explore the park i would reccomend taking days to explore it you can ussually go through half the park in one day ,5,2011-10-16
4641,Mickey's Spooktacular Halloween Party,do you want to avoid long lines do you want to experience disneyland in a totally new way you must take your family and friends and head to mickey s spooktacular halloween party disneyland there is nothing better than to channel your inner child and disney has a great way of bringing that out the park has some fantastic halloween displays out and they encourage you to bring your best costumes there was virtually no waiting on most of the rides there were candy stations set up all over the park for the classic trick or treating many characters were stationed for photo opps everywhere you turned if you are looking for a real scare this is not universal s frightnight this is a super fun time with nothing scary about it make sure you bring your best walking shoes because you will be thankful as you walk back to your car totally exhausted i will be back for sure ,5,2011-10-14
4642,Best time ever Meme's first annual disneyland vacation with all of her grandchildren.,we had a great time and there was so much to do for all ages we met some of our family members for the first time and had such a great time at disneyland we will definately do this again thanks for the great experience the kids that were there were year olds year old year old and year old and no one was ever not having fun ,5,2011-10-14
4643,Halloweentime at Disneyland,i could probably write a review each month for disneyland we are annual passholders and visit or more times per month september and october are excellent times to go the weather is usually still quite warm which is typical for southern california the best part is that crowds are generally way down especially midweek weekends can still be crowded however but not as bad as summertime the only caveat i would give is that there are usually some rides undergoing refurbishment this time of year so if you have a favorite ride check out the calendar at disneyland com for schedules things are still pricey but if you play it smart you can save some money bring water bottles to drink when you eat try a sit down place with free refills like carnation cafe pizza port or cafe orleans then get a to go cup just before you leave arrive early and use fastpass for popular rides it s not just for kids as my wife and i like to visit for date night it can be very fun and relaxing just to stroll the lands ,5,2011-10-13
4644,"Awesome, awesome, AWESOME!",having been to disneyland years ago i was looking forward to taking my teenage boys what a dissappointment the park hasnt really grown ignoring california park for the moment yet the crowds have grown we there on a sunday to us it was packed but to others it was quiet all the main attractions had o min waits there were quese for the toilet the popcorn the food places we went back on monday and tuesday at am and had hours of ok time befroe the crowds hit and the quese became crazy again maybe our expectations were a bit high there were a couple of good rides you had to work the fast pass system to get on them and the fireworks were great but i get feeling that the park just cant cope with the number of people visiting it ,5,2011-10-12
4645,Past its Prime,disneyland is an awesome place to get away from any stress or drama once you enter its like entering a new world you see little kids dressed up couples of all ages having a blast and the rides are so creative and fun the shops carry such cute merchandise that are at a lowered price than the shops in downtown disney many pictures will be taken in different parts of disneyland there s fireworks at night which can be romantic or just joyful the food is excellent you can get dinner snacks desserts anything you desire ,2,2011-10-09
4646,Disneyland is a magical place for all ages!,my wife and i go to disneyland every few years as usual we enjoyed our trip very much we stayed at a hotel across the street and arrived the night before we got a good night s sleep and bought our tickets the night before to avoid the lines if you stay in one of disney s hotels you get to enter the park at about am if not like us you get to enter at am next time i will stay in a disney hotel to take advantage of the early entrance also if you are staying at the park you can easily go back to your hotel to rest nap we could have at the hotel we were at but it would have been quite a walk the park was clean and well organized and safe as expected we rode star tours times to see the new variations i found the variations to be very minor only the first seconds seems to be variable otherwise the remaining of the attraction is the same it is excellent the entire park was decorated for halloween and the haunted mansion was totally decked out in a nightmare before christmas theme if you like that you ll really enjoy it we went on thursday october expecting it to be less crowded than usual i would say the crowd level was average to above average i figured that kids would be in school but with year round schools now you never know when the kids will be on vacation the lines for the big attractions were minutes long later in the day the lines grew to minutes they have a fast pass system where you can reserve a spot for later in the day to skip most of the line i found the system difficult to use in reality also later in the day they start to close the fast pass kiosks telling us they were completely booked up you should use them if you can we ate at cafe orleans about for two sandwiches two cokes and tip and we ate at the tomorrowland terrace about for cheeseburgers fries and drinks overall a great experience i would recommend nights at a disney hotel and one day for california adventure and one day at the magic kingdom plan on getting an early start take a few hours mid day to rest in your hotel and try to stay until the park closes check their website to see what attractions are closed we missed out on pirates of the caribbean because it was closed until thanksgiving and california screaming ,5,2011-10-08
4647,Always Fun - Hated the Lines,at years old i still have a soft spot in my heart for the original park that started it all having lived in southern california most my life i practically grew up here and as an adult i try to return as often as possible the cast members are always spectacular and accommodating to whatever needs a guest has i m always amazed at how spotless the park looks and how hard everyone works to keep it in tip top condition as for the complaints of closed rides the park closes them for refurbs and improvements to make them better than before can t imagine that being a bad thing notable tips bring comfortable shoes and a change of clothes or a poncho for splash mountain or grizzley river run at the other park you can rent a locker on main street usa for under and use it throughout the day don t forget a camera to make those memories count and snap lots of pictures also since the park is rather expensive don t hesitate to bring your own food or leave the park for meals you ll save loads of money also if you are an annual passholder you ll save on meals and merchandise ,4,2011-10-08
4648,How can anyone leave a bad review for this place?,i was really impressed with disneyland we have been to disneyworld twice with our children and wanted to take them to disneyland before they grew too old we have an eleven year old girl and eleven year old boy and a nine year old son mine are not too daring but finally they love space mountain and the matterhorn we rode them over and over it was not too crowded this time of year but there were still crowds with fast passes we were able to ride all of the rides multiple times and only have to wait on occasion in a line for up to minutes usually less we left of the days at lunch time and went to mcdonald s right across the street and up a few hundred feet up harbor street we figured this mcdonald s would bilk us but the prices were very comparable to other mcdonald s and the hotels had brochures that offered an extra off the prices they let you take snacks in with you to disneyland which was very helpful we never tried to take drinks however just brought empty water bottles to fill i loved that it was so close to california adventure we could easily go from one park to the other in one day ,5,2011-10-07
4649,I had a great time with my husband and 3 kids.,overall i love disneyland but i absolutlely don t like seeing my year old cry when we ve been in line for minutes and they tell everyone to get out of the que because the ride is broken i understand these are complex mechanical devices but i get the feeling disney is skimping on repairs and maintenance we were at disney for a total of days but in one single day we had dumbo broke matterhorn broken while in line little mermaid broke down for hours and its brand new and this is while the two major rides were down for sceduled repair pirates and dca roller coaster my message to disney is you are charging a big premium for your service so you better darn well make sure your rides are in optimal condition for your guests and quit cutting corners ,5,2011-10-06
4650,Best experience of my life!,we were at the disneyland hotel park this weekend it is really tough to navigate around due to all the construction also while the park hotel members tell you that the park is always under remodel this is most construction i have ever seend and it is frustrating and hotel prices are extremely high along with the park maybe a discount would be nice ,5,2011-10-05
4651,"Sorry its broken, sorry ride down, sorry stopped working",my wife and i visited and spent two days and one night at the grand californian there isn t much to add to most of the other reviews as far as the experience itself went the rides were great the hotel room was fine didn t spend much time there food was ok etc i would have given a higher rating except for issues with the registration check in process we don t live in the us and i paid for everything online from my hotel in dallas apparently you re sent a physical package containing tickets etc after registering i expressly mentioned that i was a tourist so there d be no point in sending any physical packages to the address in dallas as i d have left by then we were heading for san franciso before going to anaheim first problem was that disney went ahead and sent the package to dallas anyway so of course we missed it and had to make lots of phonecalls the disney helpline wasn t much help but thankfully the guys in dallas agreed to send the package by courier to the grand californian second problem since we were moving around a lot i didn t have time or see the need to have a physical printout of the pdf files confirming our reservations afterall i had everything on my laptop and iphone we took the disney coach from lax to the park and upon getting there a disney person came on the bus to check our registration info it turns out softcopies are not welcome in disneyland the guy almost turned abusive he was very rude and basically told me that he had the power to refuse my entering disney because i didn t have a physical printout it was pretty pathetic i thought and futile ,3,2011-10-05
4652,Another Great Visit to Disneyland Park,our th time in years we are from pa but travel to ca because we find this disney so much easier to navigate than florida our kids are we usually come mid sept perfect the weather is hot but not boiling you can still swim and ride water rides but not be too hot the park is all decorated for fall halloween fun it was busy but not over whelming crowded we love it cast members wonderful do fast pass its worth it food was good we did big thunder bar b que for lunch a little more money but its all decorated for fall and its nice to take a break and sit down food was good all you can eat must do rides are new star tours do first space mountain big thunder railroad jungle cruise pirates was closed bummer splash mountain matterhorn my only complaints are this park opened at and closed at i wish it would have opened maybe at and closed more like a few more hours would have been nice and not as rushed also watch if you are in park at dark the main street area is well lighted but all others are dark my son fell on a curb that was very hard to see they need to lighten up the rest of park after dark ate also at mexican restaurant great food and nice atmopshere stayed on site for first time this year at paradise pier great stay see seperate review for that didnt have problems with line cutting everyone friendly and happy to be there as we all should be enjoy and have fun ,4,2011-09-26
4653,Fantastic Experience,best trip yet disneyland and california adventure do not disappoint in one day we were able to ride every single ride sometimes twice the lines were manageable and we used the disney app on our phones to gauge wait times excellent tool to maneuver the park best advice for a one day trip is to arrive early buy a ticket to both parks so you can maneuver through each one wear your walking shoes go to your must ride events first and plan out any attractions you want to see ahead of time we stayed until the park closed and truly wanted to come back the next day our favorite ride was toy story mania a total blast we rode it twice and contemplated waiting in line a third time if you don t like heights avoid mickey s fun wheel it looks tame but it was quite scary we will be back for sure best park with the most laughs ,5,2011-09-21
4654,Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth if you have an annual pass...,my family and i have an annual pass to disneyland so we go whenever we want we don t have to wake up early to be the first ones in line we don t have to fit everything into one day and get flustered if we don t if you are local get an annual pass the cost of the pass pays for itself after visits make sure you put parking on one of the passes if you are reading this review and you can t get an annual pass i d recommend starting very early and planning out your day as much as you can go online to the disney website and figure out which rides or shows you most want to hit and make sure you get at least all of those into your day also go see the aladin show in ca adventure that genie is amazing i need to end this review as we are off to disneyland lol,5,2011-09-17
4655,This is a must see for us - twice a year at least!,well it s not like you re traveling to anaheim and thinking hm what should we do when we re there so you look it up on trip advisor and find disneyland so instead of a full review i ll just say that disneyland is the most magical place on earth we re from seattle but visit on average twice a year sometimes to disneyworld instead each year is different as our kids grow and as we add to our family it s such a wonderful family vacation and i look forward to it daily ,5,2011-09-17
4656,not the average day in the park,we re annual passholders so we go there a lot this day that we went rides broke down they did offer fast passes to compensate us but the dates were near expiration it was late so we never got a chance to use them best to go early before the rides get tired and cranky and begin shutting down great to stay late if you like to walk and soak in the sights and people atmosphere not to mention the fireworks if it s not windy ,3,2011-09-16
4657,September is Iffy - end of season closures,just a quick note the first half of september is when they do some cleanup revamping and setup for halloween because of that a number of attractions are closed for one reason or another there is probably some way to check on that but i missed that ,4,2011-09-13
4658,It's the happiest place on earth!!!,what can i say disney is the most amazing theme park and experience you can have we went on a thursday after labour day and the queues were practically non existent minutes would get you on nearly every ride the friday was a lot busier which i didn t enjoy but it s still amazing use your fast passes and you get on at least a few rides really quickly food is amazing i really recommend the chicken i would kill for the recipe of the marinade kebabs at bengal bbq next to the jungle cruise make sure you do indiana jones and the new star tours is great be warned i got soaked on splash mountain literally drowned so only do that ride when it s hot outside really disappointed that pirates of the caribbean and the haunted mansion were closed but hey that s a reason to go back enjoy ,5,2011-09-10
4659,need to do list,we saved all year long i recommed to stay near the parks go early you need one day for each park we got the two day park hopper we did fromam to pm then took the shuttle bus back to the candy cane inn then back to the park to midnight so get a map and learnd and ask an employee about fastpasses its works great you can get one ride and then go to the front of the line on the ride you got the fastpass for its great dont miss the fireworks and world of colors i dont think i got the name right but its in the disney california adventure park you need to get a fast passes for that show in the morning and the show is at night they will run out of fast passes and the show is about hr or more but its worth it and try to get there mins early because there are no seats so go left near the bridge or far right and read every thing on mousesaver com and also walk the downtown disney the stores are right in middle of the two parks my opinion is to wait for your child to get to the age of yrs or older any child under you will waste your money just my opinion anyway enjoy ,4,2011-09-07
4660,Disneyland 5K/Half Marathon,this is our second year doing the disney family k fun run it is a great activity for families who love disneyland and want to experience a different aspect we visited the day before got up and ran the k went back to the park for the next two days you would expect it to be crowded over the labor day weekend but surprisingly it was only crowded on saturday friday and sunday were perfect lines were short and it ended up being a perfect weekend this is now a family tradition maybe next year we ll try the half marathon walking not running ,5,2011-09-05
4661,What a nightmare!,since the children were out of school and we were off work for the holiday we decided to celebrate our grandchildren s rd and th birthdays at disneyland anaheim on dec th what a mistake that turned out to be along with a few hundred thousand other people our hour day netted rides total yes four for the whole day the crowds were so brutal navigating with small children and our somewhat slow adult son with a developmental disability was nothing short of a bad dream i would be hard pressed to recommend a trip to disneyland during a holiday but i suspect the crowds at any time would make it less than appealing disneyland has lost it s charm on me ,1,2011-09-02
4662,"The happiest place on earth, bring your gold card.",disneyland is a destination for young and old alike however you need to have a plump bank account to visit it we had a great time and managed to go on several attractions before the crowd built and the park became overcrowded i suggest a weekday to visit we went on a wednesday everything is priced very high but hey its disneyland right they can do that because hey its disneyland right despite the high prices for everything we had a memorable time visiting and would return in a heartbeat one tip is unless you can save a significant amount of money getting your admission tickets elsewhere don t bother also don t bother paying a few bucks more at the places nearby to avoid the lines that s total bunk we stood in line for tickets for minutes paid our each and then stood in line for minutes to get into the park i could not find anything at all that would have saved me more than or bucks off the door price of the park gates open around am but the park does not open until we stood in a pile of people for minutes sweltering until they decided it was time to open by this time people were behind us and it was like a cattle stampede once the rope was dropped why do people need to run to go on a ride i ll never understand this bottom line go you won t ever regret it and your kids will love you forever for taking them ,5,2011-08-29
4663,Awesome!,my girlfriend and i went the week friday and saturday before labor day weekend and was pleasantly surprised about the length of the lines in the park i think the longest i waited was about min we probably picked a good weekend to go the only thing i can say is that at nigh around the time of the fireworks the disneyland side gets a little crazy to move around in fastpasses are definitely worth it as with the lines begin as short as they were we would get our fastpass for a ride go on another and immediately get on the next ride i also want to say how great the customer service is at the ticket booths we booked put tickets through expedia com big mistake and expedia did not send our reservations to the will call at the park even thought our vouchers didn t work they still gave us complementary tickets to make sure we got in oh and if you don t like the heat you might not want to go int he end of august we went in the middle of a heat wave ,5,2011-08-29
4664,Incredible fun!,disneyland is great it is all so beautiful covered with trees and plants it was great fun we used the ridemax program to reduce our wait times and it worked great we never had to wait more than minutes for any ride in spite of the summer crowds it was really peaceful but yet exciting fun it is the gold standard for good reason no detail is left undone ,5,2011-08-26
4665,Fun time for kids of any age.,disneyland is much smaller and more compact than its orlando counterpart which makes it much easier to get around and enjoy the amenities we loved the rides especially it s a small world pirates of the caribbean and splash mountain adventure park was great for the younger kids and lines for rides were much shorter than anticipated food is plentiful and reasonably priced bring a stroller if you don t want to pay a day for rentals and check the disney site on the internet for ticket specials ,5,2011-08-25
4666,"Great, but needed more advice before we bought tickets",travelled from australia with two kids and loved it except that we have now learnt that be very careful when booking flights holidays etc in advance which most of us would do actually contact places such as disneyland to find out what won t be open operating during your intended time there we had day park hopper tickets you would think in that time that there would have been parades none fireworks none and there was quite a bit shut down considering this took us forever to save for looked forward to and to come home disappointed well we still made the holiday wonderful but always check ahead before booking holiday and setting your definate holiday dates ,3,2011-08-21
4667,"Not as ""Magical"" this time",just got back from a day trip with my yr old son and my husband mon thurs disneyland is a hour drive from our home here in california so we hve been to disneyland many times since our son turned each time we come we spend days so we have plenty of time to get everything that we like done we have been here at many different times of the year this is the rd time that we have been in august that being said here is my opinion of disneyland this time i think this was the most crowded that i have seen it even though some of the employees said that is was slower then it had been we got a lot done with a lot of rides and shows but we did make sure we got there early and used fastpasses make sure that you get your fastpasses for star tours early they run out by about we got ours at a m and the return time was for late afternoon we did like how they have re done this ride also make sure you line up early at california adventure before the park opens to get your fastpasses for world of color we did this and got the blue section which is supposed to be the best for the show this show was good but i didn t think it was as spectacular as some people do i didn t think it was worth fighting the crowds to watch again i would rather watch the fireworks at disneyland i have to agree with other reveiwers that there were alot of rude people and line jumpers you would hope that disney would catch on and do something about this line jumping too bad they couldn t do something about the rude people we did encounter more disney employees this time that just didn t seem to enjoy their jobs i seemed to notice this more at california adventures for some reason so the reason that it wasn t as magical to me this time was because of the rude people and employees the crowds were so big it was hard to get around and i hate how you have to show up at least an hour early to save a good seat at a show only to have the rude people show up at the last minute and give you dirty looks because you have the good seats and then try to push in front of you or at least push their kids in front of you i also noticed this happened more on this trip then when we have been there before as far as food was concerned our favorite place to eat was the new boardwalk pizza and pasta at california adventure they had a great cheese ravioli and some great salads oh and try the pomagranate lemonade yummy we used to like bengal bar b que at disneyland but this time the servings were even smaller then before and for the price that you pay we just felt it wasn t worth it the only thing i would get again was the veggie skewer because it was quite large we chose to go in august because they have all of their shows and fireworks every night but i m not sure that it was worth it this time i have always enjoyed disneyland and we were quite excited about our trip but this time it was more disappointing than anything ,2,2011-08-20
4668,"Should be Named ""Get in Line Land""",i was disappointed with disneyland i think they let more people in than they can accommodate we wasted hours in line for rides that broke down at the end of our last day our son went home crying when they closed a ride just as we got on it i don t mind spending a few bucks on overpriced items but i feel that disney is taking advantage of the masses i showed up expecting to experience the happiest place on earth but i experienced the most crowded place on earth ,2,2011-08-19
4669,Disneyland is awesome!,my family loves all things disney we really love disneyland for the things it is it s a smaller more intimate experience than disney world we like pirates of the caribbean here better than in florida we entered the park at am and it felt as if we had the park to ourselves i have panoramic pictures of us in front of both the matterhorn and castle with no people in the background ,5,2011-08-19
4670,Great Place for Kids---USE THE FAST PASS,i would definately recommend the fastpasses its saved us a whole lot of time its better to get a fast pass earlier in the morning when it s not crowded we would ride then get the fast pass for our favorite attractions and use the fast pass in the evening you get through in minutes or less if you use the fast pass between pm pm its not worth it because that is when the crowds are at the highest and it saves you nothing if anything you may even wait longer on the fast pass line during the day i would recommend leaving the park around pm to take a break especially if its hot and come back in the evening around pm it s easier to get on rides while people are watching the fireworks and fantasmic waiting in long lines especially in the heat can ware you out use the fast passes we were at the park from am to pm on the first day and went on rides using this system if you don t have a magic morning pass i would recommend still going to the park on this day even though there are people in the park already it s not as crowded as the days there is no magic morning maybe most people prefer to go to california adventure assuming it s already crowded we did not have magic morning passes but this was the day we went on the most rides your better off getting to the ride early to pick up fast passes and making the trip back in the evening as appose to waiting minutes in a line during the day all the fast passes have ran out by the evening and there aren t as much fast pass holders walking around at night making both trips you save a good minutes just make sure you make enough time to use all the fast passes you picked up plan accordingly if you start picking up the fast passes in the morning its easier especially if you want to ride twice most staff members we encountered were friendly there were a few that were very cranky and rude but i will get to that overall disney is a great place to visit i would definately recommend getting there early be there by they open at am even on magic morning days when they open privately at still be there at because you will have more done by the end of the day disney is it s best and more magical in the mornings the prices for food however are outrageous we ate cerial for breakfast in our rooms we came back to our rooms for lunch and made sandwiches and we would eat dinner at a restaurant outside of the park we saved so much money and we were able to get the kids souvenirs and and give them a break from the park they took naps in the middle of the days and were well behaved at night and lasted until pm in the park the tickets are expensive but way worth the money for all that we had done we even saw fansasmic the fireworks and captain eo and still had time on our hands to walk around and shop visiting disneyland with my brother and and yr sisters was every bit as magical as i remembered it it really is the happiest place on earth if you put an effort and plan it right in the morning that is i gave it four stars because of two reasons the first is because because of all the rude and unruly guests that try to cut you in line and push through the crowds we had a family chain and a woman literally came and pushed between my brother and sister who were holding hands another thing if you do fantasmic arrive early if you want a good seat it seamed that even though the show started at we got there at pm and it was already about full we were very fortunate to find descent seats that a crew member lead us too keep your whole party with you we saw a a little family in front of us that was trying to save a little area for more family who had gone to dinner people were fighting with them and trying to steal their seats even after you could clearly see they were saving the seats they eventually resorted to laying on the grown even then people were desperate enough to ask them if they were saving those seats beware of mean people who don t care about your chidren and will do anything they can to cut in line steal your seat or even push your kids out of the way to get to where they need to go like i said the disney magic ends around am the second thing was when we arrived back at the park we came back in the middle of the second day donna who was checking the tickets almost didn t let us in because our stamps were washed off even though my boyfriend still had his stamp on it didn t matter my siblings and i didn t have our stamps and that s all that mattered to her even though we had our entry tickets we told her they must have washed off with getting in a pool jacuzzi showering and washing hands as much as we do and she said well everyone else still has theirs and they go in pools so she basically called me a liar i went to guest services and complained if my boyfriend hadn t shown her a picture we took in the park then she wouldn t have let us in even then she was iffy because we had on different clothing i understand that disney needs to keep track of scammers but do it the right way they should have a bar scan on the ticket that has our names in it this way we have to use our i d s and tickets to get into the park you can t not let someone in who paid for their tickets at disneyland what if i had no pictures with me dollars worth of tickets and you have to rely on stamps when i have my ticket in my hand seriously i don t think this is the way mr disney would have wanted it and i even got stamped twice once at disneyland and once at california adventure the first day it stayed on but it seems when we were stamped the next day the stamp over inked us put more money into ito those little cards check i d s and do it right it seems that all the nice people that worked there were all young kids and people in thier s and s people all the rude and obnoxious people were the middle aged and elderly i hate to put it that way but that s the truth another lady freaked out on a young kid who was leaning on a chain who does that if you don t like your job then don t work there don t be rude especially at disneyland however the rest of our stay was perfect so that s why i only took off one rating so other then rude people it was amazing trip ,4,2011-08-19
4671,For families with special needs kids,get the guest assistance pass for each special needs kid it was a lifesaver for us our kids have lots of trouble waiting in lines due to their diagnosises and with these passes our visit was absolutely amazing when kid wanted to go on a ride and the other kid wanted to go on a different ride we were able to split up and accommodate our kids wishes every staff member we encountered were helpful and friendly ,5,2011-08-18
4672,Amazing Place!,visiting disneyland with our year old granddaughter was every bit as magical as i thought it would be it truly is one of the happiest places on earth my only reason for not giving it stars is the problem with the line jumpers on so many rides we saw one person must have notified family when he she were getting close and entire families were soon pushing their way through the line to almost the entrance it was really frustrating when we re standing there patiently with a small child and people are so rude one entire family of adults actually cut in under the rope guide and walked right in front of us in line it happened on many rides so i felt they might need employees to start watching for this other than some rude people the place was fantastic it is very clean and employees are friendly i definitely will go back ,4,2011-08-17
4673,it's just not the same,the employees were a lot less helpful this time plus i had block out dates on my season pass so i went to upgrade the employees kept asking why i didn t just buy block out day tickets i don t know what those are they are not in the ticket section of disneyland com to purchase the main problem the whole days though was the approximate wait times for example if the wait time said or min we would be in line a min of min every time i get that it s really busy in the summer time but this was mid week and this park has been around for years the accomodations of the guests were mediocre at best and i am seriously considering not renewing my pass as i have for the last few years i expected more considering how much money everything costs now ,3,2011-08-13
4674,Where dreams come true,no matter your age you will love it it has a little bit of all orlando parks even if have been to disney world i recommend visiting this original one if coming in an adults party only or children older than i would say that day is enough to have a good idea but if you are not in a hurry than to days would be better ,5,2011-08-12
4675,We love Disneyland!!!,we went to the magic kingdom last year and it was not as special as disneyland park it just has more charm and its still our favorite kingdom castle park we love the original tiki room the beautifully restored small world and new orleans square toma sawyers island has been re imagined as jack sparrow s hide out and space mountain is more fun than ever we were sad that the iconic matterhorn was closed for rehab for our visit ,5,2011-08-12
4676,Atmosphere PLUS!,this is one of those holy grail places most kids want to go to personally i was a fairly realistic kid and knew it d never happen so i never fantasised about it my mother though was absolutely dying to go it was just one of those must see things and i m glad i got to take her admittedly neither of us are ride fans so we spent most of our day trawling through all of the penny machines merchandise stands and street scenes a big tip if you want to get on a particular ride or see a character get there early we luckily stumbled upon the tea cup ride first thing and got on almost straight away it was a great little ride even for someone like me that gets queasy very easily next we wandered up to toon town and found mickey in his house posing for photos minnie was doing the same out the front of her place his house was a winding line of sorts allowing you to both explore and experience a possibly ridiculous line to see him fortunately by the time we d wandered through it the line was only reaching the back of the little picture theatre and what a great way to keep everyone entertained with little previews of the old mickey movies all with commentary from donald and goofy the best part is not only are you able to have your photo taken professionally but also by the attendant that will take photos with your own camera a great personal touch overall disneyland is all about the atmosphere the kids having a great time performers in the street genuinely happy attendants and of course the absolutely impeccable upkeep of the entire park every part we encountered was fresh with colour and alive with people and laughter be warned though it is an incredibly busy park so get to what you want to see very early as someone who wasn t overly fussed on seeing it either way i would recommend you see it if you like anything disney related even star wars fans theres something for you too you ll have a magical time ,5,2011-08-12
4677,Surprised by the size and value,visited in the off season no huge lines which from reading other people s reviews can be an issue at peak times we were surprised by the relative inexpensive food drinks but it is in the us and food prices are way cheaper than here in australia we seem to be well truly ripped off at our attractions wshen it comes to food drinks but enough of us our yr old had as much fun and this yr old on the rides and attractions enjoyed it so much we re now going to go to the one in orlanda florida oh wear comfortable shoes and eat after the rollercoasters ,5,2011-08-12
4678,Wait Wait Wait in Line,we paid full price for one day park hopper for three people at apiece we felt it was very expensive we tried to be efficient about the rides we wanted to go on space mountain was broken when we got there at opening got fast passes for the ride at noon the return time was pm is this ridiculous i thought so after returning at the appointed pm time my family waited minutes and the ride broke they never got to ride it disney didn t offer we didn t ask for but assumed they would some type of sorry for the inconvenience gift we had to wait a minimum of minutes for every ride with the execption of soar n which we got to very early in the day overall we paid a lot of money to stand and wait and stand and wait and stand and wait we rode as many rides as possible and that would be rides for each not a good value for the money when we weren t waiting in line we were trying to make our way through crowds of people the park closes at midnight at least it did the day we were there and as i sat waiting for my family to wait the minutes to not get to ride space mountain i opt out of this ride i watched at least a hundred hungry people get turned away from the only sit down restaurant in the tomorrowland area which closed at why they would close so much earlier than the park was a mystery i can say every employee we met was friendly and nice but save your feet and your pocket book and go to a local amusement park it will be much less expensive and you will have the opportunity to ride more rides ,2,2011-08-11
4679,VIP service 'CA VIP TOURS' at Disneyland,i can t imagine going to disneyland with out tim and ca vip tours with three kids under five tim made our visit stress free for me and my wife from minimizing waits on even the most popular rides to just minutes knowing exactly what the kids would love and when to get there and being someone our kids just adored getting the most out of our time at disney couldn t have been easier with tim leading the way i never had to look at my map never had my munchkins complaining about waiting too long and never had to figure out where we needed to be next while the natives got restless tim made it all happen with ease from meals and dining reservations to the shortest waits possible for any and every ride to an itinerary our kids loved we couldn t have done it without ca vip and you can be sure we never will many thanks to andy tim and the whole ca vip tours team j b family,5,2011-08-08
4680,The most magical and amazing experience!,disneyland was the most fantastic place to go for our family vacation we planned our trip for the week just after the american thanksgiving the timing was perfect because the line ups were reasonable and the weather was perfect my husband hates crowds so going when we did was perfect you could walk around disney without bumping into people i would recommend if going at the end of november or beginning of december like we did to take some warm jackets for the evenings it can get quite chilly at night we rented the lockers and put our warm jackets and extra snacks in my husband and i liked having the free coffee refills from the main street coffee shop we each bought ourselves a disney travel coffee mug and refilled it a few times throughout the day to keep costs down we took in our own water bottles and snacks and i would share my dinner s or lunches with my youngest because she is a light eater eating in the park does save time you do not have to eat at the expensive restaurants they do have great bagel shops and food stands we felt that leaving the park to go and eat would take up our valuable time and we didn t want to waste one minute make sure you have a plan of where you will go each day you are there especially when you have kid s with a considerable age difference there is less stress and you end up seeing everything you want and sometimes you can go on your favourite rides twice we found that if you see the parade fireworks and one of the major shows your first day you can go on the rides that are the most popular with minimal waiting times during these events the rest of the week ,5,2011-08-02
4681,Wait times are MUCH worse than in prior years,we go to disneyland almost every year the kids go more often with school band trips etc i have to say i don t know what s going on but the wait times have gotten ridiculous i mean going in early magic morning and still having a minute wait for peter pan get real of course you need to plan your fast passes to get the best out of both parks usually you can hold a time for disney for california adventure but even so there was over a minute wait splash mountain in the fastpass return line i also saw more incidents of line jumping than i ever have in over years probably because people are tired of waiting but still in years past that was cause for expulsion from the park but nobody even seemed to notice or care so there were a lot of frayed tempers around too the rides are still great and the staff are friendly overall we ll just try to go back during the non busy season and maybe it ll be better ,3,2011-08-01
4682,Get organized before you go,the key to enjoying this park which is always crowded is organization if you have never been here i recommend watching the secret tour of disneyland available on amazon before you go not only will you learn some history about the park to enhance your visit you will also learn some secrets special things to look for and ask for when there arrive early and grab a fast pass for space mountain on your way to the line for the matterhorn the best days to go are midweek tuesday or wednesday take advantage of entertainment within the park that doesn t have a line such as the horseshoe review and stake a place early along main street for the parade on a hot day a cool place to rest is the abe lincoln theatre on main street which is rarely crowded and fascinating to watch there s better food in adjoining downtown disney than in the park kids love the rainforest cafe which can get a line longer than the rides make a reservation early ,4,2011-08-01
4683,Wonderful Employees always happy and eager to help!,i recently was in disneyland in california with my grandchildren and was so impressed with the whole atmosphere it was my fourth visit and everything is as exciting as the first visit cleanliness is excellent no trash to be found staff always picking up staff always smiling and extremely helpful disney characters very good especially tinkerbell she went out of her way to make my grandchildren feel very special take lots of bottle water with you we found all the drinks far too expensive on site and on the other side the food reasonable make sure you take a good hat sunscreen and plan to spend days to cover everything enjoy ,5,2011-07-30
4684,Every bit as good as its Florida counterparts,we ve got young children ages and and we did a day park hopper for disneyland and california adventure although i d read several negative reviews against both of disney s california theme parks i have to say the negative reviews seem totally unjustified and this particular reviewer has been to florida s disney parks twice in the last years so i feel i m totally qualified to compare the locations for the most part disneyland resembles florida s magic kingdom theme park i read many reviews stating that it s much smaller than the florida park but my family and i didn t find that to be the case at all as i wrote above we had a day park hopper and i think that was just about right to cover both parks adequately it gave us plenty of time to re visit our favorite rides attractions and also gave us enough time to pretty much see everything in both parks our unanimous favorite ride in disneyland was the matterhorn bobsleds no fastpass available so my advice upon entering the park would be to grab a fastpass for something else my family really liked the star tours ride and then get on line for the bobsleds before the line gets too long and you have to wait minutes even still a minute wait is probably worth it compared to other rides with similar wait times one small complaint i have about disneyland vs disney world florida is that there were far fewer opportnities to get autographs pictures with the characters the princess fair show was a good spot they didn t announce it but once the show ended the princesses would come back out to sign autograph books and pose for pics that way you didn t have to wait in the normal take a pic with the princesses line right outside the theater we got pics with cinderella aurora and snow white but were sorely disappointed that there were no signs of belle ariel jasmine mulan or pocahontas anywhere in flordia ariel has her own grotto for picture taking and jasmine also has photo opps with aladdin at certain times in a certain section of magic kingdom at epcot mulan is often found in china belle in france and jasmine in morocco and pocahontas was easy to track down in animal kingdom she even has her own show there so in short our autograph photo books were a lot emptier than i had hoped for during our visit to disneyland and california adventure but the staff were just a nice as the staff in florida it s disney the happiest place on earth people how can they not be happy unlike it s florida counterpart magic kingdom you can walk to the main gates of disneyland the main entrance is right on harbor blvd and also on harbor blvd are mcdonald s subway and a host of other options which meant we weren t held hostage at the park when lunchtime came around in fact we often took the minute walk outside the main gate to hit mcdonald s since it was much more affordable than buying lunch inside the park overall we had a great time with our day park hoppers duh it s disney for crying out loud nobody said it s a cheap place to visit but then again if you re visiting socal and you ve got young children then you ve got to go don t be dissuaded by those reviews that say that anaheim s parks don t stack up to florida s parks because we didn t believe that to be the case a good time was had by all ,5,2011-07-29
4685,The Best Theme Park I Have Ever Visited.,my wife and i recently visited disneyland on our honeymoon it was one of the best trips i have ever taken i went into it expecting long long lines everywhere i went but was pleasantly surprised that the long lines are only at some rides and most of those have the fast pass option that allows you to scan your ticket and come back at a designated time and skip most of the line there were some things that were overprices mostly food but in general it was not as expensive as i was expecting it to be i would suggest one park per day passes though i never found myself jumping between parks even though i paid for the option to do so ,5,2011-07-28
4686,Disneyland is Magical,every year since i was years old my parents took is to disneyworld in florida for the first time my fiance and i traveled to california we stayed in san diego and decided to drive hr and minutes from san diego to anaheim ca to visit disneyland when we arrived we parked in the downdown disney area it was we ate at the espn zone we love their hot wings and philly cheese steaks there is shopping in downtown disney a lot of restaurants and all of the disney hotels it was a minute walk to disneyland pp that is not including the adventure park which looked amazing tower of terror roller coasters etc which was more a person we did not have a lot of time to spend there since we had to meet with our friends later it has the same vibe as disneyworld but a tiny castle which was a little disappointing a lot of rides some similar splash mountain space mountain and some new ones i loved being there yet we only were able to go on rides in about hrs because it was a minute wait for each ride we even skipped splash mountain which is my favorite since the wait was very long next time we will go during off season but we will def return again ,5,2011-07-28
4687,Great time,let me tell you we had a ball at disney land unlike disney world you actually get to see mickey and take a picture with him the park is much small than the property in orlando that makes it much more easier to access the staff is more friendly and their customer service was outstanding ,5,2011-07-22
4688,"Something old, something new, something borrowed (money !!)",disneyland is still a fantastic place to vacation great america s theme park santa clara is only half hour drive from my house and with discounts is only about as expensive entrance fee marine world vallejo is only about an hour away from my home and is only a little more expensive than great america but i still fly to john wayne airport rent a car and stay at a disneyland area hotel because disneyland rules there are some great new attractions and some old favorites my kids loved it and my grandkids love it too great america is not kept up very well and is dated marine world is a little better but disneyland beats them both hands down the only drawback to disneyland is the i wish they could find a way to make it more affordable especially in these difficult economic times ,5,2011-07-21
4689,Disney wonderland,what can you say about disneyland that hasn t already been said great attractions great food eat at big thunder ranch bbq fantastic food and great entertainment well worth the money ,4,2011-07-18
4690,The Happiest Day Ever,last weekend i took my year neice to disneyland this was her first time there and she told me that it was the happiest day ever when i heard that i knew that paying the high ticket price high parking price high food prices high hotel price for two days waiting over an hour in line to get on a minute ride and suffering foot pain with blisters was all worth it it s about the kids not me disneyland can be the happiest place on earth if you face it with an open mind and heart the park was very crowded after p m catching the train saved time and helped lessen foot pain plan the park out and don t try to see it all in one day i would recommend you get a hotel so you can have a place to rest we tour the park from a m to p m had lunch at the rainforest cafe in downtown disney went back to the hotel from p m to p m return feeling relaxed and ready to take on the night crowd it is very crowded at night because people want to see the shows and fireworks i think they should dump the night show and only focus on fireworks disneyland did not do a good job controling the crowds people everywhere with no place to go it was a true traffic jam every ride was open and working which was a surprise to me overall the park is a great place to take the kids ,5,2011-07-11
4691,Amazing Trip for Christmas,this was sorta our christmas gift to the entire family a trip to disneyland which we did not regret first let me say that we love to eat out so the most memorable experience we had was at the big thunder ranch bbq oh the ribs mouthwatering the meat fell right off the bones and it s all you can eat amazing and well worth the money we could see the reindeer that were there with santa claus from where we sat we listened to and enjoyed live music very entertaining the entire place was decked out in beautiful christmas decor from christmas lights to giant wreathes hanging on light posts the haunted mansion which was revamped for the occassion is one of our favorites with the nightmare before christmas theme once you get in you almost forget about how long the lines are to get in later in the evening we ended up finding a great spot up front to see the parade what an awesome display of characters and floats christmas trees towering and gingerbread men paraded down the road what a sight we plan on going this year for halloween i am sure we will not be dissappointed ,5,2011-06-26
4692,"Truly the ""Happiest Place on Earth...""",my year old daughter and i visited disneyland on june nd and rd it was her first visit and it did not disappoint i had friends trying to encourage me to visit other amusement parks for thrill rides since i have a teen but i m so glad i didn t listen we had a blast the park is super clean the staff is helpful and friendly it was truly magical she was even picked to pilot the mark twain steamboat which meant so much to me since it was her first time thanks captain dan yes it s pricey but sometimes it s necessary to not put a price on memories and it is why it was my daughter s first trip i m a single mom so we had to save for this blow out we stayed at a good neighbor hotel red lion and it was within walking distance still we were so tired that we were grateful to have the option of the art bus our first day we went from am to pm no rest because of sore feet i appreciated the smaller size of disneyland plus it s the classic and original as others have said pick off peak times and try not to be there on a day where an attraction is opening our second day was when star tours opened we had to spend quite a bit of time in california adventure i really hope we get back there again it was our best vacation ,5,2011-06-20
4693,Disneyland is the best!,we celebrated our rd anniversary at the disneyland resort and stayed at the sheraton park anaheim wonderful hotel but next time we want to stay at the grand californian hotel for some spoiling we are true disneyland fans and had a wonderful time we have been to wdw in flordia but we find the disneyland resort to be so much more relaxing and enjoyable it is very quaint and very magical this is our favorite vacation spot and are looking forward to our next visit in a few years ,5,2011-06-17
4694,Nothing but great!!!!!,what can i say its disney i have never had a bad experience at disneyland and i visit here at least every years if not sooner i have lost count of how many times i have been to disneyland i love this place you walk in the main gate and the smiles instantly come on yours and everyone elses faces as you enter a complete new world and leave all the hustle and bustle of the world outside i would be a season pass holder if i lived in california and i would go as often as my wife would let me every employee has a smile on their face and are are cheerful and ready and waiting to help you with anything that may come up the park is always clean and the food is good they call it the happiest place on earth for a reason and i totally agree ,5,2011-06-17
4695,Takes hours to adjust to the DL flow...Experience was uneven,as first timers we didn t find our groove at disneyland until after lunch then things started to click thank goodness because i was starting to get depressed that our expensive visit to the american icon was going downhill fast day visitors like us can only seem to get on older less popular rides with waits of minutes or less or we wouldn t see practically anything popular in the enormous crowd the park was a bit confusing to navigate i ended up in a few dead ends when i looked for short cuts there are none my spouse thinks the ratio of people to space that makes disneyworld a better bet than the land so minute waits means no space mountain star tours mattahorn or roger rabbit for us it is hard to express the despair one feels after spending a fortune and traveling across the country for maybe once in a lifetime visit to this iconic place and disappointing a child we had the make the most of the tikki room small world pooh alice toon town jungle cruise and the like which all were very well maintained and my child did enjoy i previewed the fantasyland rides before my year old got on them and had to nix them because i know she would be traumatized by the evil element in snow white sleeping beauty castle pinnochio and mr toad why oh why all the negative nightmare imagery in children s rides disney even the haunted mansion was not as scary as these hello the pleasant rides like peter pan have long queues we didn t get on dumbo until pm a major saving grace is the shows which for us almost makes the for tickets worthwhile but if one wants to hop to california adventure to see their abundance of shows the highlight being aladdin the long walk and big crowds will cost you precious time only had time for a few smaller rides in ca had to skip soarin and toy story sigh so things started to look up when we got on pirates in a short minutes saw the fun parade and got quick single rider entry to the terrific indiana jones after dark caught some of the impressive fantasmic show alone child too afraid of all those sadistic villians and great fireworks the crowds do not disperse much if at all at night lots of couples making out all over the place i liked the lantern and torch lighting atmosphere at night but combined with the loud stereo sounds of drumming in adventureland scared my child all over again tried not to feel overwhelmed by the overstimulation overall the masses were polite always making room for us to pass had one horrid moment when a running teen smashed into my daughter s arm the many cast members we talked to throughout the day held up their reputation well just wish disneyland could create someething such as day long park reservations like a hotel we were never in the right place at the right time to use the fast passes so we could experience more although to our young child some of those experiences were too foreboding and not so cheery would consider bringing her back as a much older child to the world if crowds are in check ,3,2011-06-15
4696,The Original Park that Walt Built.,sure it s smaller than walt disney world and it doesn t have the buzz that the new harry potter area at islands of adventure has but it s still cleaner more attractive more populated with attractions and better run than virtually any other us theme park ticket prices have just gone up so maximize your time with a little research there are many good guildbooks and phone apps out now to minimize line waiting ,5,2011-06-15
4697,Time of our lives!,took my yr old son to disneyland in may excellent time of the year in ca saw everything that we wanted to see and some things twice disneyland could use a few more fast pass options and my recommendation is to use them when you can indiana jones ride is a long one but a fast pass really helps the world of colors show at california adventure was spectacular you must see this and word of caution when they say wet zone they mean it get your fast pass for this show first thing in the morning if you stay at grand cal hotel you get an earlier opportunity for a fast pass the red zone is a wet one but nothing a poncho won t help star tours is better than ever and the new ariel ride i was able to sneak peek this with a cast member friend was a wonderful new addition to california adventure park plenty of healthy food options available at each quick dining area if you are watching your girlish figure but it s hard to pass up the churros on almost every corner and the delicious baked goods and ice cream on main street usa we were able to see evertyhing that we wanted to see in full days of course my yr old didn t want to do all of the roller coasters so i would suggest days and a park hopper pass to get all of the shows and rides in may was a wonderful time to go with the weather sunny but cool ,5,2011-06-13
4698,My 4 years old remembers each one of the rides and attractions,my cents with disney here book a hotel close to the park i have a separate review for the residence inn at maingate loved it pros kids and adults have a nap in a comfortable bed before heading back for the second part of the day leaving the park for lunch is always a good idea i don t like the overpriced and low quality food in the park have a plan the park has rides and you will be lucky and tired if you get to do if there are fantasmic shows see the second the first usually at pm is super crowded half of the people leave the park right after the pm show leaving better seats for the second show many people see both do not miss fantasmic it s a great show my top just adding one more sample point there are many top s in the internet fantasmic haunted mansion space mountain the new star tours indiana jones mad tea party buzz lightyear parade astro orbitor this one b c kids love it carrousel my yrs old loved it others worth to mention pirates of the caribbean splash mountain notice that my top belong to of categories special shows tomorrowland rides adventureland new orleans square rides and fantasyland rides my advise work tomorrowland in the morning and adventureland new orleans in the afternoon use the time in between for fantasyland or to visit mickey goofy allocate time for the parade and especially for fantasmic play disneyland with your kids upon your return my son remembers quite well this was our nd trip with children and i think we were a little bit wiser this time we didn t do as many rides but we chose really good ones for the family the nap in the middle of the day really made a difference ,5,2011-06-13
4699,Ariel's Restaurant a must see,our first trip to disneyland with our grandchildren was absolutely perfect we got the hopper passes and had so much fun hopping from california adventure to disneyland the little ones loved the small theme park bug s life in california adventure but skip the movie it terrified our little ones with the spraying water and the blasts of air we left after minutes with crying children all under age the highlight was the lunch at ariel s restaurant it was so nice to see the disney princesses who actually visit your table and take pictures the food was good and although pricey we figure we were paying for the princess show and the for a very tasty lunch i heard breakfast is the same price so i would definitely book lunch we had the pasta yummy and an amazing and generous serving of tri tip steak which i would highly reccommend the grandkids ordered from a kids menu which was perfect for them desert was also delicious so take an afternon break and eat at this restaurant great food great service and great experience with the princesses ,5,2011-05-23
4700,"Not only for the young, but the young at heart too....",i don t care if you are five or fifty disneyland is the greatest place to spend some time at we spent three days in disneyland and california adventure park and had an absolute ball if you ve never been before get someone to explain the fast pass to you it is a god send enables you to get on more of your favourite rides and beat the massive queues and we found that there were lots of great eateries in the parks and quite reasonable prices too but if you are not a massive eater go halves in a main or entree as they are called meal with somebody like we did and the night time shows are sensational a must see we will be back we just hope we don t have to wait another years sigh ,5,2011-05-23
4701,Go Early!!,my family loves disneyland so we decided to spend part of our spring break there we found it very crowded and spend a lot of time moving from section to section looking for better spots the day we arrived when the park opened was a lot of fun we met characters and rode the classic rides several times before the park grew too crowded we had park hopper tickets and found california adventure way less crowded in the afternoon and evening ,5,2011-04-22
4702,Classic fun.,where do super bowl winners race car drivers and astronauts go when they achieve their life s dream disneyland of course not to come off sappy but this place is an institution the only problem is because of its history this place gets packed every tourist season if you re a socal resident though you can go in off times and get the discounted prices making it a lot more fun and worth it ,5,2011-04-15
4703,Happiest Place On Earth,you can t judge one facet of the park but you have to look at the overall experience to judge disneyland park it is great with such a wonderful atmosphere the service is superb wherever you go and although lines may be long at times you still can just walk around and enjoy the environment ,5,2011-04-01
4704,stay for fireworks,really wasnt at the top of my list on california trip but glad i went spent a day and half at this attraction could easily spend longer was not travelling with children good honest fun lots of everything to see and do it rained while we there but did not dampen visit in anyway dont buy tickets from machines placed in hotels better deal at gate its got the lot ,5,2011-03-25
4705,MAGICAL visit again!,my wife and i had already visited disneyland resort in august and had spent two days one night there a couple weeks ago we decided to go in just for the day that didn t change anything though we still wanted to see and do everything we woke up at around quarter to four ran into some issues with our alarm so ended up waking up a bit later than we had planned we threw our bags in the car as we were staying the night at the tropicana inn suites right across the street from the park on south harbor boulevard and started the four and a half hour drive into anaheim from las vegas when we arrived at the park we exchanged our online print out tickets for the actual passes and headed into disneyland park arriving later than we had planned about an hour or so after the park opened we decided to have breakfast we stopped along main street u s a at the carnation cafe their menu reasonably priced their staff very kind after a nice breakfast we headed into tomorrowland we were able to ride space mountain with little to no wait except for a fairly short morning breakdown disneyland park s version of the walt disney world original is even better than its floridian counterpart next we crossed over into adventureland to ride indiana jones adventure no breakdown this time tourists why d it have to be tourists indiana jones adventure is disneyland park s equivalent to disney s animal kingdom s dinosaur new orleans square was next and unbeknownst to us was celebrating mardi gras decorations a plenty beads were draped over balconies and street signs we rode pirates of the caribbean next which is almost eight minutes longer than the magic kingdom park s this pirates of the caribbean features leisurely a stroll past blue bayou restaurant as well as several scenes discarded from florida s we finished up our time in new orleans square by riding haunted mansion we headed into frontierland and rode big thunder mountain railroad afterward we strolled into fantasyland to experience a few classic films first hand in pinocchio s daring journey and snow white s scary adventures we also took the happiest cruise that ever sailed in it s a small world my wife bought a ring in one of the shops on main street we peaked in main street cinema where walt disney s original short steamboat willie makes a regular appearance we then headed into the disneyland story presenting great moments with mr lincoln which just shouldn t be missed it started to rain so we hopped aboard the disneyland railroad for a round trip around disneyland park before it could start to pour which it did between tomorrowland and main street u s a passengers witness two unique dioramas featuring the grand canyon and primeval world riding along disneyland railroad provides your only opportunity to see them they aren t present in florida by the time we arrived back at main street u s a the rain had stopped or so we had hoped we exited disneyland park in order to continue our day of fun across the way entering disney california adventure park we immediately headed for golden state to get fastpass for soarin over california we then made our way to paradise pier my wife is very brave but she refuses to ride california screamin with me therefore i take advantage of single rider and am on and off in minutes it was then time to return for soarin over california after we headed for hollywood pictures backlot we stopped at character close up and right in time too as it began to pour again the centerpiece of character close up is the inventive toy story zoetrope we checked out the gift shop while the rain started to clear we were handed two fastpasses for the twilight zone tower of terror at the entrance so were able to take the elevator ride of our lives with little wait on our way back to paradise pier i bought a sweatshirt at the gift shop next to grizzly river run we had already made reservations at ariel s grotto a few weeks prior in order to take part in the world of color dining package with preferred viewing ariel s grotto is a rather expensive restaurant but a very nice way to end your tiresome day it was then time for world of color for fellow east coasters or those that have been to walt disney world illuminations reflections of earth at epcot was my favorite nighttime show at any disney park until seeing world of color for the first time from the little mermaid to aladdin to pocahontas and fantasia world of color lights up the night sky quite like no other my wife loves so close and nearly cried when hearing it the show is impressive yes but it also takes an emotional toll on its audience as well from the cheers of hearing the first few beats of under the sea and a whole new world to the laughter at watching dug from disney pixar s up ascend in front of you announcing my name is dug and i like you squirrel unfortunately for us it started to pour once again a quarter of the way through hands freezing clothes soaked we managed to stick through the entire show including the tron legacy encore any other show wouldn t have been worth it but world of color isn t any other show so in the end due to the iffy weather lines were down to a dull roar throughout most of the day since most wait times were less than thirty minutes we only used fastpass once only space mountain encountered a delay and a speedy delay at that despite the sky opening up during our favorite part of the day or i should say night we had an amazing time at the disneyland resort ,5,2011-03-21
4706,Disney in a Day!,i could not agree more with what was written by stacycs i too visited disneyland from dec to jan and it was our rd visit in years with our children we actually woke up christmas day in melbourne and surprised the kids then with what we were doing christmas days kids fun trying to explain that to them in the past we too have visited during the quieter months although it is great to get on the rides and see all the attractions without queueing nothing can beat the atmosphere created with the many excited visitors both young and old i also agree that doing your research is also the key to experiencing a wonderful time at disneyland but isn t that the case with visiting anywhere in the world i too made calls at odd hours in order to book a nearby hotel tropiccana inn just a basic hotel room like the desert inn where we stayed last time book lunch for christmas day blue bayou cafe world of colour fantasmic and a bippity boppity boo makeover for my youngest daughter i think my y o was a bit jealous just a bit the food at the cafes restaurant was excellent and quite affordable this research does not need to takes months either we planned it in about weeks after thinking one day wouldn t it be great to go to disneyland at christmas and the idea grew legs from there to top it all off there is nothing better you can do than experience new years eve at disneyland no idiots or alcohol and they even had a limit on the number of tickets sold for the day yes it was busy on the monday after christmas day but the park is open until midnight and from about pm onwards there were little or no queues for rides big thumbs up ,5,2011-03-06
4707,Nothing Beats Disneyland on New Years Eve,myself along with my two chidren ages and visited disneyland california from december we experienced a half day of reasonable weather on dec and thereafter the heavens opened up and it poured like nothing we had experienced before for the next days straight the main problem with this is that there is extremely little drainage in the entire disneyland park this made for small lake size pools of water throughout the park the huge deluge of water everywhere in the park for days on end also caused approximately fifty per cent of the rides to be closed at any given time for the duration of our holiday not good when you have paid several thousand dollars for a family disneyland vacation during christmas this was extremely disappointing to my two children and myself disneyland gave guests no compensation for operating at approximately fifty per cent functionality i find this business practice to be completely unethical also when i asked various disney employees why they were closing numerous rides they dismissed me walking straight past me without speaking very arrogant and rude this was our fifth and last trip to disneyland california in the future we will choose a holiday destination where we will be treated decently and where the weather is more predictable ,5,2011-01-25
4708,The worlds no1 vacation destination,it was my first time last sunday at disneyland and as i studied tourism management it was always my dream to work there once however i am glad i never did as the whole experience was so disappointing all the rides are so old break down all the time and the staff is so unfriendly this is certainly not what i expect when i pay usd per person and kid we went last sunday to disneyland with our little kids luckily we got genie fast tickets otherwise we would not have been able to ride a lot however all the little kids rides like tea part dumbo alice peter pan do not have fast lanes so it makes actually no sense to buy genie for little kids however for the first ride i waited min with my son for rise of the resistence only that it is breaking down while we are on the ride we got fast lane tickets to come back later but as everybody got it it of course took over min on the fast lane later as well a friend who is going to disneyland all the time was kind of shocked when i told him that we did not got fast passes for everywhere for the whole day which was common a few years ago as we wasted hours for not beeing able to ride ride of the resistence when we wanted to do the rider switch at thounder mountain it was broken down as well and when we were riding space mountain it broke down while we were on the ride the staff even had to push us to the station the kids were scared from the dark and a broken down ride and the worst was that there was never an apology or anything not even an offer to ride it again and even with genie you can only do each ride once in the fast lane also buzz lightyear s space ranger spin and splash mountain broke down when we were on it is nice that genie pass includes all pictures for free however there was barely a chance to take pictures my kids wanted to take pictures with minnie and mickey mouse but this park area was under construction there was a min queue for princess pictures and on rides only space mountain and splash mountain took pictures furthermore i was very shocked by the none existence of staff training like nobody heard before of creatina a positive customer experience we went for lunch to naples while we were still waiting for our pizza my husband got bis ordered gnocchi but no cuttlery was on the table he had to wait and we even had to ask for it we bought icecream next to autopia i bought the frozen banana which shows on the pictures with just black chocolate around the sales person even told us if it is fine with nuts yes i am fine with all kind of nuts but not peanuts so why can she not say its with penanuts i would have never bought this the worst staff experience was shortly before the parade min before the start they told us we should go away cause all the spots are taken and we can not watch it we should come back hours later with our little kids seriously i do not unterstand why people are not allowed to stand behind the people sitting on the seats there would have been enough space they just did not let us go there it should not be surprising that everybody wants to see the parade why is your car management better than crowd management covid spread prevention measurements are all out of place you can barely find hand sanitizer nobody wears a masked and when queuing or on the rides of course you can not keep a distance also pricing wise i do not understand why they charge full price for kids above our year old is so litte she is under and was not allowed on many of the rides it would definitely be more fair if pricing is not according to age but according to the kids height ,5,2004-03-23
4709,It really is the happiest place on earth,fun fun fun it is really the happiest place on earth we took the entire family of we all had a marvelous time ,5,2004-02-11
4710,A Definite Yes,excellent very generous breakfast at the carnation cafe great staff there too guests were in great moods and very polite to each other of guests were not wearing masks at all but no one hassled anyone else about mask no mask genie worked well and is worth the mobile orders from the disney app is an excellent way to save time and hassle getting food,5,2004-01-07
4711,"Not worth the money, rides broken down all the time",disneyland park was very enjoyable as well as california adventure at disney our family had a terrific time and this was our second visit with young kids we went during the food and wine festival which was also great ,1,2022-04-28
4712,Happiest Place on Earth,my kids my wife and i enjoyed every moment of the day except for the long lines do your family and yourself a favor and just by the lighting lane pass it definitely worth every penny,5,2022-04-24
4713,Great to get back to normal at Disney,my family adults and children spent a week in la for spring break i booked four disneyland single park tickets with genie a month in advance we spent hours am to pm in the park and were not able to see everything we wanted to but had a lot of fun the park was clean but very crowded even with genie we waited in many long lines the food was okay but very expensive overall a positive experience but we enjoyed our day at universal studios more ,5,2022-04-17
4714,A Magical Day Indeed!,still excellent and new additions like star wars galaxy s edge keep it refreshed and up to date have been many times and it continues to be a new experience even as the kids get older ,5,2022-02-25
4715,Excellent,i just want to say that i fell in love with disneyland it s magical steeped in history and has a really authentic feel that being said man does it get crowded and boy is it expensive it loses a star because while we had plenty of great cast interactions shout out to shannon in chamber of commerce at dca of the time we were greeted by cast members who looked like they d lost the will to live don t get me wrong wdw and dlp have them too but not in the abundance that we found them here i m afraid which is a shame we knew we were off to a bad start when we arrived and went to get a birthday button and she didn t even say happy birthday just pointed to a stand with buttons it wasn t until the end of my second day that a lovely guy called joe in a gift shop in critter counter dca was serving me that he offered to write my name on it for me i get being busy and all but disney is meant to be setting the world standard of customer experience and on this trip it was not ,5,2022-02-24
4716,I ❤️ Disneyland,hadn t been there for years nice to see changes and also nice to see the same friendly and clean park that everyone has been remarking has gone downhill i didn t notice that at all maybe it s all in the way you treat the cast members first i prefer the way they do the characters now sure there are no hugs but you can still get a good socially distanced interaction and i hope they keep it that way i also like the reservations for the park itself i hope that doesn t go away if there s any complaint it s what did they do to the turkey legs i know it was always a love hate relationship between people i used to love them the one i got was so sinewy and full of other bones even with a knife it was impossible to get the meat off so that ll do it for turkey legs for me i don t usually eat at the parks ate at hungry bears this time and enjoyed the food the merchandise in the stores is very scant i m not a souvenior shopper but the friend i was with is and the shelves and racks were wont for more stuff ,3,2022-02-24
4717,Disneyland is even fun in the rain and hail over a workday,we love disney this trip was the first for my little granddaughter and everything was near perfect there were a couple of things that i wanted to share first no one checked for vax cards at all and we were there for a week this surprised me secondly its a small world was still in christmas mode which was also surprising other than that we had a great time between the parks and wildlife definitely be back there s no bad disneyland trip and almost everyone was super friendly and helpful ,3,2022-02-16
4718,Contrary to other reviews - service hasn't gone downhill.,i always love the gardens so perfectly manicured landscaped and beautiful in terms of amusement parks no one outperforms disney i still love this park having visited several times over the years ,5,2022-01-31
4719,Disneyland / California Adventure ROCKS!,i haven t been to disneyland for years we went to celebrate our first date here and now we are celebrating year anniversary we saw so many strollers with small children and those scooters i would recommend people not take their kids until they are years old so they can take it all in i see them in lines looking at other peoples butts the rides can be in the dark scary and can jostle you around ex the matahorn for an adult or older child disneyland is the happiest place on earth the staff are so polite it is contagious buy the lightning pass so you don t have to wait in line so much take time to just look around you might find a hidden mickey there is a lot of junk food here but during holidays we had this amazing plant based mexican type sopa and ate dinner in a mexican place to get something healthy bring water bottle fruit nuts and a sandwich for kids so you can keep going stop for parade see fireworks walking back to your hotel make sure to check schedule for the pop up entertainment we saw bell ringers singers and dime singers drummers dancers their costumes and makeup are fabulous disneyland could do another part for small children of just things to look at and touch with minnie and mickey walking around disney came close with the the yosemite looking park with ropes bridge it was great and santa was there ,5,2022-01-22
4720,If you don't like Disneyland then stay home,as an adult it s nice to go without kids so when the kids go to college book a trip and enjoy feeling free ,5,2021-09-20
4721,Well Accommodated,despite all the coviod business the park was largely open and inviting and my friend and i had a good time on our day visit ,4,2021-09-16
4738,Very crowded,its been years since we ere last here we found it extremely crowded and no it wasn t holiday time ,3,2019-11-13
4739,You must visit Star Wars Galaxy's Edge,it was my first time visiting and it was incredible stars wars stuck out for me the setting is phenomenal at a night time when the sound of an x wing comes on you genuinely look up expecting to see one fly past that s how realistic it is the new ride is wicked a nice simulator where there are roles so you all have your part to play queues aren t very long at all and because you re constantly moving you don t know how long you re waiting haunted mansion is perfect such an amazing experience it s dead clean no litter anywhere the performers are fantastic make sure you see fantasmic beware strollers and electric mobility scooters they will go over your toes and you won t get any apology ,5,2019-11-12
4747,Star Wars Rocks it!,had a fab day here and it has some good rides but it s so busy here anytime after midday and the crowds are large and the wait times get long and just walking around the park can be tough people bashing into you it s also not as good as disneyworld it feels quite cramped in there and the staff are not as happy or friendly highlights for us however were the indiana jones ride and thunder mountain galaxys edge is over hyped in my view the scenery is incredible but the m falcon ride is not the best not a patch on rides like avatar in disneyworld or the harry potter rides at universal and it s so expensive especially if you wanted a drink in ogas cantina paid for a very small cocktail gone in a few swigs we also found many of the ride times were completely inaccurate thunder mountain took double the time advertised and at least other rides took much longer just be aware and i would advise not booking fast passes until later in case overall we have had a great time here but some improvements would enhance the guest experience further ,5,2019-11-03
4748,My favorite!,i prefer disneyland to wdw simply because of it s size disneyland california adventure and downtown disney are all right there together and easily accessible by walking instead of having to wait on a monorail bus boat etc ,5,2019-10-31
4753,Happiest place on earth & the price tag to match,first off word of advice from a california native when planning to visit disneyland please know there will always be lines and a crowd plan accordingly and expect this as long as you have a positive attitude and realistic picture the experience will be much more pleasurable and a great time know that every day of the year disneyland is busy this is one of the top california destinations and consider yourself very lucky if you do visit and find the park to less crowded know that you will probably get on to larger attraction rides in one day otherwise you will need to get a to to five day pass to explore and get on everything know that you will probably get on to larger attraction rides in one day otherwise you can choose to purchase one of the day passes to explore and get on everything you would like use the fast passes our suggestion would be to go to the first location of your favorite ride and get your fast pass to return at the designated time on the ticket enjoy your time while waiting with your loved ones and don t focus on the time it s the fun in every moment that will make this day special also adults if you would like to indulge in a drink or two our suggestion would be to choose a place outside the theme park at downtown disney we would not suggest splurging at oga s cantina in the star wars area you will be disappointed if you choose this option as their drinks are pre mixed double the price from outside the park and no option to sit not worthwhile at all unless you are a star wars junkie and it is a must do for you much better options to give yourself time to relax for a moment outside the theme park simply get your hand stamped when you re exiting and re enter re charged and ready for more fun one last tip locals it is definitely worthwhile to turn this visit into a staycation and book one of the hotels that is located close by this way you don t have to worry about driving back home after a fun filled and tiring day this has been a game changer to nit commute the hour drive exhausted enjoy ,4,2019-10-15
4754,Another great time!,traveled to socal with my small group of teenage girl scouts concierge was over the top helpful as always presenting of my girls with graduation plus another special badge to commemorate their last year as girl scouts we opened and closed the park having a great time star wars experience was a hit girls did the ride twice definitely a memorable overall experience ,5,2019-10-14
4755,Always a Pleasure,always a fun time at dland was more fun having attended gay days at disney the only disappointment was that galaxy edge was only completed ,5,2019-10-13
4756,Gay days YAY!!,i ve been to disneyland several times in my life but recently went in september this was by far the best time of year i d been as the crowds were low the wait times were reasonable and the weather was pleasant i d recommend using the max pass option if you re there during a high season ,5,2019-10-09
4760,This review is about Star Wars Land: Galaxy's Edge,we knew that the second ride in this part of disneyland hadn t opened yet and wouldn t be open until january but we couldn t wait to explore the new star wars land so went in september the one ride smuggler s run is amazing get in the pilot s seat and be prepared to work steering either up and down or back and forth i was a gunner so seated in the second seat behind the pilots i hit the buttons when i was supposed to and dared to look occasionally though my motion sickness potential prevented my watching consistently they did an amazing job with this ride and i would certainly go again and try to glance up more the world they created batuu is other worldly and fascinating we really enjoyed exploring all the bits of it and returned in the evening to see it lit up oga s cantina you can get a reservation days before or easily the morning you go in the park on the disney app is a blast the drinks are delicious and generously alcoholic if you wish and the atmosphere festive we could have done with a few aliens wandering about or sitting at the bar that would have added to it we had lunch at the docking station delicious chicken salads but the ribs looked good too overall an amazing experience ,5,2019-09-15
4775,Avoid weekends if you can.,this park has something for everyone of every age everyone in the world knows something about disney land and will have something in this park that they enjoy we had days and had different experiences from very full and almost feeling overcrowded to what i would say is mildly busy the app is a must great for telling you line times have a plan if you want to get the most from your day we also did the maxpass and that saved us a lot of time in some of the rides for fantasmic we did a package from the hungry bear and had a great view the best we have ever had without being around too long customer service is second to none here everyone is super friendly and willing to help ,4,2019-08-15
4776,keeps you young forever,i always feel like a kid when i visit disneyland i am laughing screaming running around dancing and crying disney keeps me young forever,5,2019-08-12
4778,New Star Wars park,unbelievable how the park can keep so many people organized and moving the attention to detail on the new star wars park was amazing and i would go again just for that bring lots of money or your own food as it is incredibly expensive to eat at the park ,4,2019-08-08
4779,First-time Visit To California & Disneyland,this was my first ever visit to the state of california and disneyland having visited disneyworld fl many times i had my expectations for a wonderful time set i was not disappointed the staff was friendly from arrival to departure we our needs for specialized services they provided everything we needed to make our visit great while our son is probably a little too young to fully process the experience we all had a wonderful time if there were some criticisms i would point out there would be as follows i don t really understand why disneyland like other parks have to set prices so high for things like a bottle of water at approximately per bottle this is nearly x the price you typically pay anywhere else fitness club vending machine etc with the quantity disney receives on a daily basis it is quite sad that they opt to gouge their customers for a simple item like bottled water i understand there are water fountains in places around the park but the quality of water being dispensed is very unknown and something we typically avoid while visiting the visitor services for our special needs i was shocked by two things first was the wait time just to see someone at least minutes and the fact that there isn t a ramp to reach the original entrance one has to enter through a side location which was not as easy to locate i would think that disney would better staff this area and have accommodations immediately in view for visitors who are not able to walk up a series of stairs aside from these two items the experience was wonderful every time we approached a team member we were met with a positive employee who was ready to assist us with approximately employees disneyland is doing an excellent job putting a customer first mindset in place with their employees regardless of stature ,4,2019-08-08
4780,An enjoyable visit to Disneyland,we visited disneyland today and went to millennium falcon smuggler s run as soon as the park was open there was no queue first thing in the morning i was however a little disappointed with the ride as i had expected more certainly the star tours the adventure continues in tomorrowland was much more enjoyable space mountain now called hyperspace mountain was very exhilarating a roller coaster entirely in the dark so you could not anticipate which direction you were going to go next i got completely soaked in the highly scary and enjoyable splash mountain as i was sitting right at the front of the ride equally good rides were the matterhorn and big thunder mountain buzz lightyear astro busters was fun but i only scored indiana jones was a jerky and exhilarating ride all in all a very nice day followed by fantasmic a truly wonderful show and the fantastic fireworks that starts at pm every night ,5,2019-08-07
4782,It’s not as fantastic as I thought,i didn t impress any building because all seemed dated maybe i was expected too much fantasy or dream but i might looked at the half of their attractions because i had time only about hours and careful not to miss any of each buildings then i kind of run out time the other side of them maybe others might be nicer not sure i would not go back again anyway tokyo disney land was much prettier nicer cleaner and gave me excitement for sure but it was about years ago ,2,2019-08-06
4784,Never Disappoints!,the cost is outrageous but there is no place on earth like it just seeing princesses walking around and my daughters intstant reaction and awestruck looks were priceless most of the rides were pretty cool but some of the themes were a bit scary for younger kiddos guess we forget that fairy tales aren t without the opposing forces star wars sections needs to step it up just a glorified shopping area ,5,2019-08-04
4785,WE DID IT..........WILL NEVER FORGET IT,this was my first ever trip to disneyland after almost trips to disney world in orlando honestly i was quite disappointed the castle was under renovation which happens i understand unfortunately nowhere on their website did it state that it would be covered in a tarp when we went to guest services all they did was argue with us and say it s our fault for not reading the fine print this only made us more upset because we read everything there was to read we ran into multiple issues over the course of our trip such as fastpasses not working dining reservations being hours late and so much more disneyland was still a magical experience but disney s guest services definitely made me positive i don t need to go back for a very long time ,4,2019-08-03
4786,Great Day,this was my family s first disneyland trip we have been to disney world several times and even disneyland paris we love disney world disneyland paris wasn t as big and it just seemed like a twilight zone version of disney world to me because things were the same yet different and not as much stuff still fun but feeling unsettling lol i thought disneyland in california would be the same as the other disneyland no it s not the same as disney world but it s real close and still magical enough for me i loved some of the rides they had that disney world doesn t have or they do but they are different we did the pin trading thing which was fun and as far as souvenirs go that fits on a plane a lot easier lol the castle was so much smaller that expected so that was about the only disappointing thing i found their app has a system which allows you to order food ahead and if you use the max pass extra per person you can line up your fast passes on the app ordering the food was so much easier this way as it helped avoid long lines we also went ahead and ordered the picture package for like and all the pictures they took or was taken on rides came across to our app almost immediately the star wars stuff recently opened but the crowds but have been scared away disneyland park was less crowded than the disney california adventure park the wait for the smugglers run millennium falcon was still always ranging minutes all day so we took the morning while everyone was in line for that to knock out the other rides which now had shorter lines lol if you are like me and thought disney world is the only way to go and disneyland can t compare i say it s worth a shot i had a great time we wrapped it into a california vacation where we went to other cities so our trip wasn t all disney i can say i don t think there is enough there to stay a full on week like you can at disney world we stayed days and did everything we wanted to fyi napolini pizza in downtown disney is great we have been to italy and that s about as close and you will get to real italian pizza and for the of us in the dine in restaurant we could get out with the huge family pizza and drinks for about not including tip they have a take out right next to them with personal sizes to go too ,4,2019-08-02
4787,"Better than I expected, still magical",disneyland is quite obviously aimed solely at young children hence our group of adult friends found the rides more than a bit underwhelming the only ride any of us actually liked was space mountain the atmosphere was still fun to experience and the fireworks were great ,5,2019-07-26
4788,Great for young families,went for new galaxy s edge one of the rides won t be available until jan so maybe i would have waited did the make your own light saber thing which is totally cool if you are worried about getting it back on plane you can mail the tube to yourself thru usps for tsa is now used to lightsaber hafts a lot of the other rides have been re themed star wars which wasn t really necessary like space mountain which was better before download the app and make reservations the day of but careful they will charge you for the cantina and lightsaber workshop whether you show up or not the cantina did not have star wars iv monsters it s just a bar fireworks go off over the spires of baatu city ,3,2019-07-26
4789,"Went for new Galaxy's Edge. Doesn't redefine theme parks, but a lot of fun.",get ready to become a kid lovely rides lots of stuff to watch make sure that during the parade you come and hour earlier and book a sitting space thats a experience of a life time very well organised and be ready to sing songs with the disney characters,5,2019-07-24
4790,lovely,everyone heads to star wars right away to we did rides from til with no lines but star wars was awesome the staff at the park was great no complaints ,5,2019-07-23
4791,Whoo hoo!,the happiest place on earth doesn t disappoint star wars galaxy s edge was a bit of a disappointment the rest of park is awesome the guardians of galaxy tower of terror is awesome overall a great place orlando is better however and less expensive ,5,2019-07-22
4792,Churros rule,crowded for sure pricey for sure but still an wonderful place that is the pinnacle of theme parks ,5,2019-07-22
4793,"Crowded, expensive, but still a magical place for all ages",you just don t go to disneyland and not close it the light parade and the fountain dance made the whole day worth it save for it everything in disneyland is expensive it is worth it ,5,2019-07-21
4794,Happiest Place Anaheim,friendly staff not many products situated in downtown disney a shopping district that leads you to the disney park entrances clean and litter free ,5,2019-07-18
4796,California dreams,a place where no matter what age you are this is a place where all dreams and fantasy are made a place of hope fun and excitement for everyone we had so much fun at disneyland that we will never get bored at it so much love and smiles are spread around thai atmosphere where lots of children s and families are around a great place to remember your childhood time and a place of reconnecting and rekindle time with your children s ,5,2019-06-09
4797,Mr. Adrian Lee,so much went wrong with my last trip that disney offered me a compensation package of hotel and tickets for two at first i was disappointed because i couldn t afford to accept it after i decided to somehow come up with the money for plane food caregiver etc i was disappointed in disney s hard headedness they would not let me upgrade the hotel and take only one ticket they would not let me spit the second ticket crowds are extremely light right now with galaxy s edge reservation system but they will not let me change hotels the offer is only for the cheapest rooms in paradise pier and they are all booked small crowds like this are never going to happen again and i really wanted to take advantage of the opportunity i m more depressed disillusioned and stressed by the offer of compensation than i was by the multiple problems that led to the offer what really gets me is that someone with money would have been treated a lot better i stayed at a wdw budget hotel and they are never going to let a budget guest stay in a better hotel e hawks ,5,2019-06-08
4798,Disappointing Customer Service,we got a sneak peek at the new star wars park it isn t fully completed yet but what was finished was a marvel incredible attention to detail creativity is all around you in terms of food beverage merchandise characters etc many friends enjoyed the ride and had rave reviews since it was so different from other rides ,2,2019-06-08
4799,Star Wars,if you can make it for christmas season it is the best time to visit you can t really appreciate how awesome the season is if you haven t seen it ,5,2019-06-05
4800,A fun day at the park that set the standard for all that came after!,we had such a wonderful time truly magical we loved the frozen show and fantasmic the character breakfast was also great each one took time with each child food was also good maxpass is well wroth the money a lot of the rides are just like disney world which was nice ,5,2019-06-04
4801,We had such a wonderful time. .,this was my first trip to disneyland at years old a first for our daughter and her cousin too and years my husband had been twice before i wasn t all that excited about the trip but i loved disneyland amazing just as i imagined it when i was a child just bigger and better we only spent one day here but we made the most of it we had a magic morning pass so we went in at am took a break for a couple of hours around pm and we got home pm managed pretty much everything we wanted to ride visit experience but could definitely have spent another full day here we had a day one park per day pass we only arrived to anaheim late afternoon on first day so used our first day pass to enter the park very late at night this was a good idea as we didn t have another day to use the ticket and this way we were all set up to enter the parks first thing in the morning you have to get the actual tickets we only had a printed paper from our travel agent and have your photo taken at the entry gates definitely recommend paying extra for the maxpass pass you not only get the fast pass which you can arrange on the app on your phone but it includes all photos taken on rides and by the offical park photographers this is an awesome deal as you get your money back almost instantly we would ve saved hours of time waiting in lines there were several rides we were going to skip because even fastpass looked like it would take hours to wait for availability but keep checking in and often closer times come available you got to have the maxpass believe me and at each this is a bargain compare that to approx each for fastpass at knotsberry which doesn t include photos don t miss the shows there are quite a few throughout the day night the evening light shows are amazing food and drinks can be expensive so plan ahead the staff do an amazing job it s so clean and beautiful the sheer number of people visiting is astounding but this is definitely the happiest place on earth ,5,2019-06-02
4802,Amazing!,it s disneyland do it is s very nice park with plenty to do for the whole family get the fast pass and use it wisely one day it was the best thing to have the second day we were only able to use it once they have limited times you can use it one ride at a time i get that if they did not do it that way there would be long waits even with the pass so just plan right and you ll be good to go just expect to spend lots of dough if you eat in the park the food is very good so no issues there you ll just be paying a lot,5,2019-06-01
4803,Great time,was a shame the castle was under construction hang on tight in indiana jones it s a rough ride had a terrific time even as an adult ,4,2019-05-30
4807,Kids paradize.,its our second visit to this place first was and now the second thanks a lot to the stuff they do amazing job to keep everything running smoothly and clean the only suggestion there is no healthy food coffee shop its such a business opportunity we were looking for fresh fruts and greek yougurt in legoland wee found such place but not in disneyland please somebody make it happen its california and half of fruts in calgary from there ,5,2019-05-24
4808,Fun time with family at Disneyland,we visited disneyland as a graduation gift for my sister and took her children disneyland was just so fun we had the fast pass so we were able to go on indiana jones pirates of the caribbean hyperspace mountain and others more the children enjoyed the parade and were able to see mickey and minnie mouse we all enjoyed our time at disneyland ,5,2019-05-24
4824,fantastic day out at both parks,we had a one day hopper park as we only had one day to visit well worthh it we went to both park from when it openend till it closed really enjoyable and amazing fireworks mickey show at the end went home to bed very tire,5,2019-05-07
4825,Happiest Place on Earth,we had the most amazing time the days we were there we went to both parks disneyland and disney california adventures the staff here is amazing everyone was so happy and friendly parking was per day the first day we were able to park in the mickey and friends garage and the trams took us to the parks the last day we had to drive to the toy story lot and use the toy story buses to get to the parks the lines to load the buses were so long but moved fast get there before the mickey and friends garage is full to prevent this everyone at disney must drink happy juice i love the special attention given to my son because it was his birthday everyone celebrated him for free lol,5,2019-05-06
4826,Disneyland with toddler and baby,we had a great day trip to disneyland last week except for the high crowd levels it was hard to even move in the walkways our kids had a blast and the parks are beautiful again if the crowds were better under control maxpass def helps with wait times but disney needs to figure out a better way to control crowd levels i second another reviewer that disney could have had rides working at full capacity and employ more cast members and pay them higher wages to ensure a better customer experience they have the money so not sure why they aren t doing more to ensure guests are having the best experience possible still an amazing place to visit ,4,2019-05-04
4833,Dream come true!,may be my review is biased on the fact that i am a disney fan and this was my dream destination i mean not exactly this but disneyland paris i would request you to take the full ticket that also has the provision of taking photos this gives us a full day access to all rides though it is costly the experience is worth every penny spent at the entry even the guards ticket seller are cheerful with a smile always once you get the tickets you have to stand in a queue throgh which you will be transferred to the main disneyland through buses all the sections if disneyland are worth watching but the most important and a must see is the fireworks in the evening it is mesmerizing make sure you get the right seat so as to get the best view also few more must see are the parade the water show the band in front of the castle big thunder mountain road jungle cruise and space mountain be sure to be there till in the midnight it is a wonderful feeling ,5,2019-04-25
4834,Disneyland 40 years later.,last time i was there was for grad night in my wife won disney tickets for so we took our youngest granddaughter many of the sights i remember and haven t changes a whole lot the experience was great and i thought the afternoon parade was outstanding definitely will not be waiting another years before returning ,5,2019-04-24
5165,"I love Disneyland, but....",i am going to have to agree with my fellow reviewers disneyland is way too crowded the crowds make it difficult to really experience the magic of disneyland my husband and i tried to go to disneyland on monday morning and the security lines were backed up into the drop off area i think disneyland security needs to be trained by disney world security much more efficient in dw than dl i still love disneyland but after this year we are going to let our passes go and take a break for a few years ,3,2017-04-14
5166,Very busy,this was our first visit to disneyland although we have been to florida several times the two do not compare from the car park trams and most of the rides there is a lot of queuing people constantly push in with one person in line and then other people joining when it is near the front the rides are good for smaller children and it really is a magical place we much preferred adventure land ,4,2017-04-14
5167,A must for families,please make sure to include a disneyland trip in your memories the fairfield inn and suites main gate is a clean decent hotel and i would recommend it comfortable walking to and from the park captain kidds buffet is at main gate and has excellent food for the cost,5,2017-04-14
5168,great family time,have been going to disneyland for years and it keeps getting better always clean and staff is happy to help ,5,2017-04-14
5169,Disneyland is Always Fun!,take uber or lyft from your hotel which will save you money especially if you have or in your party the shuttle bus is very expensive and charges per person there is a spot on harbor street where you are dropped off you can also drop off and pickup disabled people there disney is not disabled friendly any longer due to the scandal a few years ago where a few in wheelchairs were selling themselves to get people through lines quickly the wheelchair we rented was terrible to push we had to know whether we were coming back for the evening or pay another to rent again there was no disability parking available the day we didn t take uber and we had to park really far away in an empty lot at night there were no workers guarding the cars the streets were dark and there were no people walking about it wasn t even that late there were a few people selling toys on the street corners the food has gone downhill since we were there a year ago the au jus french dip at new orleans was all just grease and the sandwich had little meat the bread was dry desserts were all good but almost as expensive as the food next time i will try eating at fantasy land ,5,2017-04-14
5170,Disney,my daughter and i had a great time we were there during spring break so it was crowded which meant wait times on rides minutes long fast pass options made for rides made it minimally helpful was disappointed with goofy s kitchen breakfast meet the characters we had done a similar experience at paris disney some years ago and met a lot of characters which the kids loved disney anaheim did characters and for the price a bit disappointing parks gardens were beautiful would i go again no been there done that ,1,2017-04-14
5171,Too crowded on Spring break,having been here before i knew it would be crowded but was not ready for this total mayhem the only reason i came on spring break was because we had a couple of kids who had never been before so our only option due to school was now never again besides gouging you more for your tickets on these dates the lines were horrendous hard to get around just not very relaxing i ll maybe come back someday but not too soon ,3,2017-04-14
5172,Declining Disney,i just visited disneyland for days with my kids and it has declined in the past years too expensive and too crowded disney needs to crowd control and come up with a better plan for fast passes the restrooms aren t kept clean and it seems like you are getting less for your money i let my annual pass go because of rising prices and it just isn t worth it to go anymore maybe disney world in orlando is better but anaheim is going downhill it s too bad they are all about profit and not treating the guests who spend hard earned money like they are important ,1,2017-04-14
5173,So many Childhood Memories,i don t think you have ever lived unless you visit disneyland you must watch the parade and the fireworks display ,5,2017-04-13
5174,SO Crowded at Disneyland!,recently visited disneyland for days the crowds were horrific people everywhere i used ridemax and nothing worked fastpasses barely helped at one point the wait time at thepeter pan ride in storyland was minutes really this seems like child abuse disney corporation the crowd size needs to be limited which i know will never happen corporate greed this was last trip to disney for our family so at least less people ,1,2017-04-13
5176,Disney for the win!,always love a trip to disneyland fun for the entire family the fireworks and parade are spectacular we can t wait to go back again ,5,2017-04-13
5177,Better than the Adventure Park.,spent days here won t go again will stick to disneyworld or universal car rides were good and wait time was short other then that waste of days and money ,4,2017-04-13
5178,Spring visit with Grandkids,disneyland did have easter egg hunt still going as they had not sold out for the season the park was at capacity which made it pretty unbearable by pm we left early because you couldn t find a seat to eat and the lines for all the rides averaged an hour and half of standing ,3,2017-04-13
5179,Happiest place on earth,what wonderful memories we created on our first disneyland visit we had a day pass for the parks so we got to enjoy an hour early entry on our visit as part of the magic morning and fit in a heap of rides before it got busy the kids had such a good time everything is so well organised the rides have such wonderful attention to detail too ,5,2017-04-13
5180,What have they done to your park Walt?,so i walk to the gates it s late afternoon i ve lost count how many times i ve been to disneyland i stopped at i know the place inside out to get in an to go to both resorts i did some research there s really been nothing new since i was last there people everywhere and my gut just said no the same as i had in euro disney i remember as it was back in early s having been to universal and going on the the harry potter ride is making disney a little old ,3,2017-04-13
5181,"Fun day out, although expensive!",disneyland is magical everyone knows that i enjoyed my day here despite jetlag although it was crowded i utilised fast passes and the single rider lines to make the most of my day and get through most of the rides i d give this place stars however the hefty price tag nearly aud for a day one park pass was a bit off putting i d only come back again if i came with family and stayed for longer they don t really make it worth coming for or days ,4,2017-04-13
5182,Spring Break 2017!, adults with kids and under always love how cast members are so accommodating friendly and helpful to families with young kids ,5,2017-04-12
5183,Cant wait to go back,spend days in disneyland for my daughters birthday it was fantastic from the characters at the gates when you first walk in to the rides it was overwhelming but so magical the staff were great and the line ups were reasonable take advantage of the fast pass it is really worth it ,5,2017-04-12
5184,Dreams Do Come True,this was a family dream to visit disney land it certainly did not disappoint the atmosphere shops and rides make it a wonderland of joy for all the family yes there are lots of people but it all gets forgotten when you travel back to your child hood days make sure you stay for the night parade and the fireworks show as they are a must see ,5,2017-04-12
5185,Too crowded,if you want to constantly bang into people and wait in line for rides that last minutes then this is your place i ve been to disneyland a few times and have no intention of returning the kids love it and i guess that s the whole purpose behind the place but i couldn t wait to get out the only place there that i like to go is downtown disney which is a little shopping area located between disneyland and california adventure its free to get in and a nice place to walk around and still experience some of the disney stuff i don t know how disneyland could or even should limit the amount of people in the park at one time but for me it was a miserable experience ,2,2017-04-12
5186,So much to do in this original park!!!,if you are a disney fan you know this is the original theme park it may not be the biggest park but it is packed with attractions great variety from the haunted mansion in new orleans square to star tours in tomorrowland food and snacks bountiful it is the atmosphere and setting that creates the magic at this park ,5,2017-04-12
5187,Crowd Control,we visited the park on a tuesday because we thought it would be less crowded we even checked the disney website to see if this was traditionally a busy day we arrived at the park by a m and by it felt like standing room only some of the rides already had a hour wait yikes we decided to leave the park for lunch and go back to our room to relax and de crowd ourselves we arrived back at the park at p m and was happy to see that it was a little less hectic we stayed until p m to make sure we got the full benefit of our ticket we did have a good time but we wish that disney would lower the limit of people they let into the park in one day ,4,2017-04-11
5188,Spring break - sun and friends,this was a wonderful place to check with friends in line and get great pictures this year we got all the pictures on photo pass which allowed us to pay one price correct he week for every picture digital download priceless saw lots of characters and a peek at the newest attraction being built,4,2017-04-11
5189,SO MUCH FUN,really enjoyed all the roller coasters awesome park can t do in one day so make time for or days,5,2017-04-11
5190,Still amazing! Know before you go.,as always do your homework not just about the history but about how to enjoy your time here here are the facts you must be prepared for it busy if you come at the wrong time its busy a little prep work you can save yourself and your family much heartache message me i am at your service it can be expensive however if you do some prep work bring food know were the filtered water is know how to get the freebies offered by the park and know the shortcuts message me and i am at your service it can be hard work you are going to walk a lot miles and miles every day make sure you have comfortable shoes stay hydrated your day will be long indeed if you get behind on your drinking thank the cast members for the impossible job they do every day i cannot imagine anything more difficult than the work they do understand the fast pass process you have to work the system it lets you enjoy more rides ,5,2017-04-11
5191,Disneyland,have been going to disneyland since july i still enjoy all the old and new rides the cast members have always made sure the visitors have a very good time will visiting the theme park ,5,2017-04-11
5192,Magical day out,mega cool day fun for entire family using the fastpasses is a must to experience many attractions at one single day it reduced of the waiting time a lot of walking so guaranteed painful feet at the end of the and the next day star tours space mountain indiana jones and pirates of the caribbean were the most beautiful and impressive ones ,5,2017-04-11
5193,Happiest Place on Earth,my boyfriend and i love disneyland we went along with a larger group of eight which included a nine year old and a twelve year old the magic was alive in all of us some helpful tips and tricks use and abuse those fast passes they are free you just have a limitation on how many you can have at any given time but they can cut down a minute wait time down to minutes having one person in charge of all the tickets with the ability to run up ahead and gather fast passes and keep track of all the times know what is going on in the area for instance spring break of the local schools things being hosted at the nearby convention center if coming from out of town go during the week days the capacity of the park feels like half the amount of people from weekday to weekend it changes the experiance completely if you want to do sit down restaurants make reservations the wait time can be as long as some of the larger rides plan for everything the park opens at am and closes at midnight snacks water bandaids light jacket ,5,2017-04-11
5194,Magical,great experience for the whole family recommend going at park opening and leaving at park closing avoid going back to back days it s very tiring with small children make sure to get the rider switch pass that way your spouse can skip lines with other kids this applies to families with multiple kids where you have to take turns ,5,2017-04-11
5195,One of a kind,build some bigger better rides please otherwise why not make another park and call it anaheim adventure ,5,2017-04-10
5196,Super Fun!,love disney california adventure park i should say i normally love california adventure this time i went on spring break so it was so busy there were up to hour wait on the most popular rides not disney s fault at all of course just will not go at spring break ever again ,4,2017-04-10
5197,Magical Place!!,as a socal resident i highly recommend the day pass the park is always crowded with long lines but what a magical place amazing rides for every age the parade and fireworks are beautiful i highly recommend going during the week and go to the most popular rides first before they get too crowded can t wait to go back ,5,2017-04-10
5198,It is called the happiest place on earth for a reason. Go and enjoy.,it is called the happiest place on earth for a reason go and enjoy they make a great effort for those with special needs so go if you have someone who fits that category ,4,2017-04-10
5199,Full of magic!!,i have been like seven times there and never had seen princes this time we have pictures with aladdin beast gaston and eugene from tangled my four year old girl was so excited unfortunately fantasmic was closed but the fireworks were amazing i loved how they are making tomorrowland more focus in star wars ,5,2017-04-10
5200,Fun for G'Kids But TOO Expensive Anymore!!!!,my wife and i took four grandkids to disneyland over this spring break for parking for one day tickets bottles of water pieces of pizza and two drinks two ball caps a drinking cup and a small snow globe as gifts and in that time we were there the kids went on rides total sorry but disneyland is made up of waiting in lines crowds of people and high prices it s for the kids how do families who can t really afford this go here ,3,2017-04-10
5201,Fabulous Day at Disney!,love this park as midwesterners its fun to see the original park very well maintained and great staff fun to ride the nostalgic rides as well as the newer ones best french fries ever in new orleans restaurant there i don t eat fries usually but every table had a basket casual restaurant across from tom sawyer s island ,5,2017-04-10
5202,Spring break vacation,it s a busy place we enjoyed our day at disneyland the wait times for the rides were quite long but the kids didn t seem to mind ,5,2017-04-10
5203,Always Great Experience,disneyland is one of those places where you always have a good time no matter how many times you visit we visited it on a wednesday afternoon during the spring vacation time and it was crowded but still most enjoyable especially if you use the fast pass options for the more popular attractions ,5,2017-04-10
5204,Compaed To Walk Disney World,if you have only been to disney world near orlando florida and not yet to disneyland in anaheim california try it and compare the two disneyland is much more compact you will not have to walk as far between attractions and there are several similar yet different attractions ,5,2017-04-10
5205,Very crowded and very rude.,i was in one of the marching bands that performed last week during spring break when we went behind the scenes the cast members were very rude to us and to be honest treated us like garbage after we had finished our parade which we technically paid disney for us to do in the form of park tickets we had to walk from behind space mountain to the back of toon town all while we were burning up in our thick uniforms in the spring heat meanwhile about four empty trams passed by us going the same direction the only thing we got from being free entertainment for disney was a super cheap generic chinese made cinch bag keep in mind that we paid disney to entertain their guests which they in return gave us some cheap disney branded crap and miles of walking in our uniforms ,1,2017-04-10
5207,Disneyland,very crowded long lines high prices food okay worst is when wait in line then after minutes the ride breaks no recourse the fastpass is the best way to get around disneyland just need to plan the rides so you can utilize your time as efficiently as possible ,3,2017-04-09
5208,Disneyland during Spring Break,so much fun no matter what time of year even with all the crowds disneyland is a magical place we especially enjoyed the park in the later part of the evening all the fun without the huge crowds ,5,2017-04-09
5209,First time surprise visit with famil,disneyland is an amazing place everywhere you turn there is something new just dont go on california s spring break,5,2017-04-09
5210,Getting worse everyday,first time i went to disney was probably one of the best vacations i have ever had there was a lot of people but nothing bad there were bands and music all over the place food was good employees were polite everything worked after that i have gone several times and some of them good and some of them not that good this last time i went on a monday thinking it was going to be pretty empty i forgot it was the beginning of spring break it was am and the place was packed already to my surprise now you have to pass a security check at the parking lot as if you were in an airport rude employees huge lines stupid rules tickets are now horribly expensive for a family of four expect to pay near just to get in i spent almost at lunch for the worst hamburgers i have had in a long time many of the main attractions were closed one hour lines for each ride they just don t have a limit on how many people they can handle rude employees really think twice about going it is probably the worst and most expensive vacation i have had in a long time ,1,2017-04-09
5211,Awesome time but super busy.,we spent days between disneyland and california adventure we have boys and we all had a great time and there was something for everyone it was very busy while we were there with huge wait times for rides but we were amazed at how clean the park was and how smoothly everything ran the whole park is beautiful and landscaped amazingly well we have boys with autism i can t stress enough how amazing disney was for our boys they have a program that helps eliminate long wait times in line and allows you to plan your days easily i would highly recommend checking out less busy times if crowds make you anxious ,5,2017-04-09
5212,Its Disney,its disney of course its good no its not disney world so its not as good as that but how do you beat the best ,4,2017-04-09
5213,Family vacation,what is there to say it s disney land the most happiest place on earth a few tips do not come during spring break try and come during the start of the work week and not during typical school breaks it is overwhelming how many people will be there another quick tip if you do not wish to do a park hopper and only want to do a park hopper keep in mind the rides at disneyland are directed more towards the adventure as where california adventures is more about the thrill but disney land does not offer alcohol like california adventure and downtown disney do,5,2017-04-09
5214,Great Attraction but visit off-season or mid-week if possible,there is not a whole lot that disney can do if there are simply too many people but one thing would be to allow more fast passes we also visited walt disney world and they allow fast passes a day and you can schedule all of them in advance and even on line and with the app if you have a disney account free disneyland needs to do something like this notwithstanding we still as so cal residents enjoy making the occasional visit we love celebrating our anniversary at the blue bayou restaurant and have done so or so times one suggestion if you want to eat at the blue bayou make your reservations in advance either on line on your disney account or by phone while they take walk ins which we have done a number of times reservations are best and should be done as much in advance as possible understand that a credit card is needed and that if you do not show up you will be charged person so plan well another suggestion is to arrive at the park early and go to star tours first to pick up your fast pass as that is one of the longer lines and then go ride other rides and come back the best times to go are midweek mon thur and not during high season one way to check is to go the the disney site and look at the blackout days for the various passes the blackout days tend to be the busier ones so if a day is blacked out for the passes i would suggest not to pick that day to buy a ticket eat a hearty breakfast before you go and share meals in the park to save money ,4,2017-04-09
5215,Just not the same,after visits i think i m over disneyland to many parades and shows that bring the flow of movement to a near standstill the fast pass system needs to be revamped front of line like maybe,2,2017-04-08
5216,Great for kids and adults,i have been going to disneyland since it opened i have fond family memories of being their with my parents my kids and now the grand kids when i was a teenager it cost me for a day in the park now it s they are pricing the experience out of the reach of many of us sorry to say my yearly visits may end ,5,2017-04-08
5217,All the characters of kids' dreams.,but don t take a selfie stick they aren t allowed several character autographs right away a lot of the lines move very quickly so granddaughter got to do several the parade and fireworks were amazing need vegetarian vegan food options ,4,2017-04-08
5218,The happiest place on earth,what s not to like about disneyland it s really the happiest place on earth and has the best electric light parade and fireworks anywhere spring is a good time to enjoy everything we love disneyland and have many memories of great times with family ,5,2017-04-08
5219,New Experience,went to disneyland for the first time without kids all grown up it was actually really fun no rushing for things and able to really take it all in the park has changed a lot by adding a lot of star wars attractions since i d last been there are a couple apps out there to help you really navigate rides and attractions too make sure and ride the classic rides as well pirates of the caribbean etc still a really good time to be had in the park at any age ,4,2017-04-08
5221,"Magical, but long lines make it a painful experience especially for the little ones.",you really need to stay for a minimum of days in order to appreciate both parks the lines are just way too long even with fast passes and magic morning we stay at the disneyland hotel so we can walk back and forth the the park and also because you get magic morning so you get to do basically rides before the park is over run with a million people magic mornings aren t so magical because getting up at am to get ready to get kids fed and dressed for magic mornings really doesn t make for a relaxing vacation as you re running from ride to ride before the rush enters the park ,4,2017-04-08
5222,Amazing visit as always !,i could not believe that after years since the first time i rode on pirates of the caribbean that it was exactly the same and still the best what a vision of walt disney to build a dream park that just keeps on giving ,4,2017-04-07
5224,Always Fantastic at Disney,how can anyone complain about disney exceptional customer service everywhere the park is busy but always something to see and do indiana jones ride broke down during our visit and the staff kept us informed and offered fast pass vouchers immediately to everyone ,5,2017-04-07
5226,Who Doesn't Love Disneyland!!,my daughter and i had an awesome time we arrived on a friday morning at around am we coordinated our fast passes and had been on all our favorite rides by pm it was a great time as usual we love it here ,4,2017-04-07
5227,The Original Disney Park,my first trip to disneyland was fantastic walt disney is my idol and i felt like i had to take a trip to his original park while i do prefer the florida parks this one has a charm the florida ones don t i liked seeing the characters walk around as if they live there i loved new orleans square there are a bunch of small things i love about this park that the other location doesn t have however there are a few things that just don t make me feel the same love for it the cast members didn t seem as nice or welcoming as the ones in florida the confectionary doesn t have as many options as floridas and it s not maintained as well i did love disneyland and some of the attractions are way better here its a small world is the perfect example if you ve never been to the original park you should go at least once it is very charming and sweet ,4,2017-04-07
5228,It really is the happiest place on earth!,since i have been to dl so many times i figured i would leave a quick review with some tips for first time visitors disneyland is expensive and crowded there i said it if you can get past those two things you will have a great time over the years i have come to accept that if disneyland was any cheaper it would be even more crowded so i suggest treating your trip here as just that a treat know going in that you will spend more money than you are comfortable with but hey it s a potentially once in a life time experience for a lot of folks here are some tips for folks that may help make your day less stressful bring sun screen it can get hot in so cal and if you are like me it doesn t take much to get burnt to a crisp bring water snacks as of the last time i went to dl water and snacks were allowed definitely get some food and drinks in the park itself but make sure you have some supplies on you just in case stop at town hall on the left hand side of the park after you go through the tunnel they will give you a pin if it is your first visit birthday getting married etc make sure you get there early as they run out of pins when cast members see your pin they will say something nice to you get there early and plan on staying late if you get there just as the park opens or slightly before you can easily get on some of the longer line rides take this opportunity to hit up space mountain star tours or indiana jones manage your fastpasses get one when you enter and try to be strategic with which ones you get and when you get them the less you have to walk the better so plan out where you want to go and at what time consider dining at the blue bayou i have gotten reservations the day of and i think we were lucky to get them call ahead to reserve seating and keep in mind that the restaurant is semi fine dining and imo not a great place to bring small children unless they are well behaved main street is open for an hours or so after the posted closing time so you can wait until you leave the park to pick up souvenirs and treats enjoy your time and take lots of photos every trip for me has had some of that trademark disney magic have fun ,5,2017-04-07
5229,The lines are ridiculous,my daughter and i had a couple of days in anaheim at the end of a week trip to la and considering we went to tokyo disneyland only a couple of months ago we had the luxury of skipping some of the rides in disneyland that we had already been on and didn t need to go on again so we opted for a day park hopper i realise that s the most expensive option but i didn t want to spend another usd for us to have a nd day just for the sake of making it a more economic option even so i really can t see how disneyland can justify charging usd each aud to stand in huge lines waiting yes i realise now it was spring break but a theme park should be able to handle its busiest times and i really don t think disney can or is it that everyone just loves standing in lines and queuing for things that was one thing that my daughter and i couldn t believe the lines of people queuing for absolutely everything maybe queuing is something that australians just don t like to do based on recommendations from friends we made sure we were at the gate by ish lining up with everyone else as soon as the park opened we went straight to california adventure park to get some rides in before heading over to disneyland at am we immediately got a fast pass for the indiana jones ride glad we did because it was still a hour wait until we could use it and when we did we immediately got a nd fastpass it s a bit deceiving by skipping what you think is the queue when you hand in your fp but there is still quite a long way to go after that point and still lots of queuing to do despite this it was our favourite ride during the course of the day we got fastpasses where we could but otherwise didn t wait in lines any longer than minutes so that means that we missed out on some rides that we would have really liked to go on like pirates we thought the crowds would die down towards the end of the night but even at pm the stand by line for indiana jones was still over an hour the food offerings were expensive usd aud for a pack of caramel popcorn thanks but no thanks if i went again i would definitely take my own food comparing disneyland to its counterpart in tokyo we would go back to tokyo in a heartbeat so much cleaner more spacious less crowded much shorter lines overall i was disappointed with the day and won t bother coming back next time i m in the us ,3,2017-04-07
5230,Fantastic park lives up to the hype,we visited disneyland in late march and early april and had a fantastic time with our family there is plenty to do over the course of several days and a variety of rides for all ages and interests the electric light parade was a fun blast from the past catch the park later in the evening if you can to take advantage of shorter wait times otherwise head into the park right when it opens if you have small children and get most of the major rides done before the busy afternoon hours ,5,2017-04-07
5231,I always love a visit to Disneyland!,disneyland does it like no one else we go back to visit about every years and my husband turns back into a little kid this time we went for my son s st birthday a place for family fun without the pressure of gambling getting drunk and all the ugly rights of passage to adulthood my son isn t into that scene so this was a perfect place to have some fun and celebrate my only criticism is that i think disneyland needs to curb their attendance at ticket you want to be able to enjoy the park and not wait for an hour in line for every attraction of the days we were there it was just too crowded ,5,2017-04-06
5232,socal local who's a Disney not _,hubby and i have the season passes and i especially love to come to the happiest place on earth though the crowds can be daunting we take in all in love the see the tourists reaction and i like giving out tips on disneyland fastpasses shortest lines and which ones worth the wait i ll never tire of disneyland the place is immaculate well kept and always a treat despite the crowds ,5,2017-04-06
5233,NOT DISNEY WORLD,sadly we went this past monday which was during spring break for kids that s not disney s fault but aren t from ca and we didn t know i can tell you it s too crowded during spring break you will spend your whole dayd waiting to ride we were able to get fast pass but they ran out we rode rides during our hour day ugh disneyland though is so dirty there was trash floating in the castle moat on the streets on the rides the bathrooms were dirty and i mean very dirty we ate at the blue bayou and it was delicious high priced but good although disneyland doesn t allow alcohol california adventure does so the drunks and i mean very drunk drunks will wonder over im sorry walt we love you but not your original park we will not be back ,2,2017-04-06
5234,Fun Times at the House of Mouse,as a socal resident i ve been to the park with family friends more times then i can remember but we always have a good time try new food items this time around it was gold dusted churros the grey stuff at the pop up beauty the beast restaurant red rose tavern in fantastyland this past trip due to being part of a convention was able to get a discount on passes it was less than regular price for a park pass they had twilight passes for a person adult child enter the park anytime after pm and stay till closing which for us was midnight perfect when your checking into your hotel picking up your convention badge and some fun time at the park we walked over since close by or you can take art shuttles for per person per ride drops you off right by the entrance tip if your able to purchase ahead of time at your local target one is miles away from park grocery store or disney store gift cards to use inside the park for food beverage souvenirs it really helps you keep track of your spending and every cashier i encountered informed me of how much was left on my card s or circled the balance so i knew sharing food is a ideal too portions can be quite large and can feed two my family doesn t eat big portions during lunch dinner since we snack throughout our day also check into city hall before you venture into the park if that day is your birthday receive a special button to wear if your with someone who s disabled special needs and they have a hard time standing in line like my son who s on the autistic spectrum they put the disabled individual in their system and how many guest so you can go to the exits of rides the disabled person plans on riding on and small wait time at the time i visited city hall they did not have a list of restaurants that serve gluten free or other dietary issues concerns but was told by the cast member assisting us to let server know to pull a chef and they can see what they can do to accommodate your dietary needs ,5,2017-04-05
5235,What can I say It's Disney!!!!,this is my favorite park i have been to most all the parks this always makes me feel like what i saw on tv as kid so it makes it real for me its smaller than fla but to me its the best ,5,2017-04-05
5236,First visit!,we are annual disney world guests but this was the first time making it to california what a cool experience to see all the history of walt actually making this come true i loved new orleans square and season of the force make sure you get buttons at a store in the park so people can share in what you are celebrating ,5,2017-04-05
5237,Very nice,i been in disneyland maybe times and always have fun the staff is very friendly always looking forward to fill up your needs,5,2017-04-05
5238,Disneyland was awesome,we did disneyland but didn t realize it was spring break here but still had a awesome time my only complaint was i had read that when you saw a street sweeper that they would give you a pin not one had anything seems like they would be more than willing to satisfy a guest especially at the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-04-04
5239,Great Day - should have done another!,what can you say its disney everything was great liked the flash pass system was a crowded day but the lines weren t too long ,5,2017-04-04
5240,Don't Bother,it is ridiculous to spend the many hours to go on just one ride each ride was this long not just a few rides i m sure they can come up with a better system other than charging exorbitant prices for vip for rides its not like disneyland is cheap time to think outside the box its not worth the time and money to spend all day at the park and go on rides ,4,2017-04-04
5241,What can I say,i love this place takes all of your cares away and transports you to another world the closures in roa are disappointing love to park hop back and forth between the two parks ,5,2017-04-04
5243,Kids Love it!,high price but the kids love the place some days are wall to wall people others are not what i would call crowded at all it just depends the addition of star wars is pretty cool ,4,2017-04-04
5244,RUDE RUDE RUDE,unfortunately our very first experience at the park was trying to rent a stroller once we stood in line for more than minutes to get in we were sent back out of the park to the rental booth when we went out our hand was stamped and i was directed to the rental station by the attendant once the stroller was rented i returned to the same attendant to reenter the park she asked if i had a card i said no you didn t give me one when i was here minutes ago she told me i would have to go all the way back through the long line to get back into the park i asked how i would know i needed a card when she clearly didn t give me one she said that she didn t remember me and turned her back on me i was furious and asked for her supervisor another employee nearby not looking at me said go to the other line and that was that the day was ridiculous there were so many people in the park we could not even walk let alone keep our family together rides ha we rode all day arrived at am and left at pm and that was with fast passes and a wheelchair it was one of the most expensive and horrible days of our lives no one had fun what a farce ,1,2017-04-04
5245,Nostalgia!,we are disney fanatics we were a little surprised by the size of the park only because we have gone to disney world a zillion times it was much smaller than what we were used to but it was still awesome we visited during the mickey s not so scary halloween event which had plenty of trick or treating also the haunted mansion was magical adults will not fit easily in the ride together though also space mountain s special halloween show awesome it is more comfortable than the orlando one as well no magic bands used here yet and we did not know they still did fast passes at the kiosks until it was too late in the day ,5,2017-04-04
5246,Mickey and Minnie where are you?,went to disneyland searching for mickey and minnie to have pictures taken with them read the schedules for their appearances and most of all ask the workers at the park what time are they appearing for autographs and where then wait wala worth the wait we are couple that get excited to see the mouse what happens in disneyland stays in disneyland ,5,2017-04-03
5248,The Happiest Place On Earth,we have gone here every year for the last years with a large family group it is a little expensive but worth every moment of grandchildren smiles and squeals of delight if you haven t gone there in awhile please splurge and do it life can be short but memories last forever ,5,2017-04-03
5252,A little bit of everything in one place,nice place was spring break so was people all over had a lot of fun but we get long lines good part you pay one ticket to see a lot of attractions but i prefer orlando ones every park has their own magic negative part each park is a ticket,5,2017-04-02
5253,What's not to like,it s a trip back to childhood great memories and imagination yes there are lines but if you go at the right time the waits are nothing ,5,2017-04-02
5254,Happiest Place on Earth,we have gone to disneyland many times with our kids this time it was just my wife and i it was a new experience and confirmed that it is truly the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-04-02
5255,Always amazing!,we had a great time the rides are great for kids of all ages very few rides were closed for refurbishment but check before you travel we stayed across the street from the front gate which is super convenient ,5,2017-04-02
5256,Love Disney! But crowds too heavy,as always a great experience from food to entertainment top notch but the crowd level really ruins the experience just too many people this week was stressful and disappointing,4,2017-04-02
5257,Early 20's with my Girlfriend,okay so i was having second thoughts about going here thought why would i want to go to this childish style theme park my partner and i almost gave it a miss for me the rides were average and are more experience rides rather than thrill rides space mountain is overrated and fairly boring indiana jones is the absolute best by far pirates of the caribbean and haunted mansion were awesome as well for me once being inside it was little to do with the rides more so the experience of being inside the original disneyland the smells as you re walking through the happiness everywhere the attention to detail on the rides i m so glad i experienced this and it is a massive highlight and memory that has stuck with me as a australian the corndogs turkey legs salted mangoes sweets pineapple juice w ice cream it all won my heart my future adventures will definitely be going to all of the second parks to check the thrill rides out in the adventure parks fantastic day ,5,2017-04-02
5258,Wonderful,disney is a wonderful and magical place the fast pass system makes it easy to get in line at a certain time however it can be a lot of back and forth and many steps in a day planning ahead is key and take your lunch food snacks water this would have been nice to know you still can bring these items in at times the crowds are overwhelming and difficult to move around ,4,2017-04-02
5259,Absolutely worth the trip,we are avid disney world goers having little bed in florida for years we were excited to see disneyland but we re not sure if we would love it we did we also loved that california adventure park and downtown disney were so easily in walking distance it s hard to imagine if you are used to disney world it was fun to see how it was similar to and different from disney world we loved it ,5,2017-04-01
5260,A great bonding experience,disney was great with all the usual rides and a few updates but parking was atrocious and way away from the entrances to disneyland downtown disney was fun and provided some reasonable more filling food options food in disney and drinks were outrageous nevertheless a great family experience and you can take food and drinks in although they will search your backpacks ,5,2017-04-01
5261,The magic of Disney is not as strong as it is in Orlando,we go to disney a lot once a year usually and we go to disney world we just went in october but we were in the area so we figured we would scope out disneyland the first thing i notice is the staff is not near as nice or polished is this really disney i kept asking myself the entrance to the park is forced through downtown disney and a tsa like probe entering the park does not seem magical at all where is the music and the happy people the attractions were nice and i appreciate the rides were different than orlando even the rides with the same names had variations that make it worth the trip the food seems much more expensive a slice of pizza for bucks rather than the ability to purchase a whole pizza for is insane so smiles from the cast they all seem beat down and depressed the park offers little shade and it s miserable walking around in the afternoon the castle is so much smaller and there is a huge shortage or places to eat i would never go back to disney if disneyland were their only park i will continue to visit disney world,3,2017-04-01
5262,Fun Family Trip,disney is a great family park we recommend arriving early because it can get super packed we recommend buying your tickets on line and print them at home it s a less line you have to do they now have fast passes next to some attraction keep in mind not all the attractions have this we recommend doing this to save time it tells you what time you can just walk in the attraction without doing those long lines when it comes to food don t forget to have the dole whip float it s so good and refreshing for lunch we recommend the rancho del zocalo restaurante it s mexican food at a very affordable price at night they have the electrical parade this is not a big deal its a bummer because they block all the mayor streets so if you want to go to an attraction they make you do a big turn to get where you want i must say this sucks if you are tired so on this same note wear comfy shoes trust me the night show that we recommend not missing is the fireworks and world of color show this is so beautiful all in all this trip was very fun ,5,2017-04-01
5263,Family Day at Disneyland,let s face it this is the happiest place on earth with that said we had a fun time we did bring our own snacks and water so that we wouldn t have to take the time to stop and eat we spent hours at both parks and got to ride numerous rides yes it was busy but the crowds were manageable and we all had a great time ,5,2017-04-01
5265,Birthday,took my niece for her birthday if you tell the person when you are buying the tickets they will give you a button and you can write your names and stuff on them so they have buttons for like birthdays and weddings etc we went on a day that it was supposed to rain all day there wasn t a drop it was crowded but i guess it wasn t as bad as normal works for me ,5,2017-04-01
5266,GO!,we go every two years and love it the happiest place on earth for sure make sure you utilize the fast pass system during the middle of the day you ll get a lot of rides in if you can get there early and stay late ,5,2017-04-01
5267,Grandsons' first visit,our visit to disneyland was so that our grandsons could meet the characters that they know from tv and movies they loved every ride that they were on though we didn t make it to all of the rides during our days in the park our visit was during spring break season and it was often difficult to navigate through areas of the park due to the crowd size we managed to snag a prime spot for the electric parade on our nd night and were thankful for the front row view ,5,2017-04-01
5268,Great family vacation,we always drive here for day weekends it can be crazy and crowded but my family has a great time all the time my daughter has always been able to see her favorite characters and even got them to sign her birthday card when we went for her rh birthday ,5,2017-03-31
5269,It really is the happiest place on earth!,disneyland by far surpassed my expectations sounds silly but at the age of brought tears to my eyes watching my childrens face when we walked through the gates was next level just amazing disneyland needs to be on everyones bucket list young or old you need to see this place ,5,2017-03-31
5270,Go during non-peak months,tickets are expensive considering you have to pay for anyone s over in addition to for parking would recommend disney world in florida any day over disney land for the monies you pay lines were way too long for popular rides in mid march waited a minimum of an hour each ride kids were getting pretty tired ended up covering only magic kingdom missed out on visiting tomorrow land frontier land and adventure land electric parade was a worth the wait about two hours in advance for a good viewing area seating for the parade it s small world was great peter pan was not worth the wait ,3,2017-03-31
5271,Spring break,it was so crowded that it was very difficult to ride rides the employees there are not near as friendly as in disney world we were there celebrating my daughters th birthday we were told that if she wears a button the employees will say happy birthday etc and make it special this was not the case at all none of them ever said happy birthday they were rude on the monorail as well as the car rides the one employee on luginies ride made it special by having people in line sing happy birthday disney world the employees help make the experience wonderful and are so helpful ,4,2017-03-31
5272,The ORIGINAL with additions,this is where the disney theme parks started not to be missed at times very crowded fantastic shows ok food some great attractions and you get to meet the disney characters a must for the kids,5,2017-03-31
5273,AP holder,we are annual pass holders disneyland is expensive but amazing depending on the time of year you go it can be less crowded the park is decorated for halloween and christmas but christmas is the absolutely most crowded time of the year some rides need to be upgraded especially the matterhorn i understand it s a classic but the ride is very uncomfortable ,5,2017-03-31
5274,Visit during Halloween!!!,you can t possibly regret visiting a disney park for halloween the trick or treating is beyond belief ,5,2017-03-31
5275,Disappointing,my wife and i had never been here before so we decided to take our kids for their first time i knew it was going to be overcrowded and i knew the lines were going to be long that wasn t what disappointed me we went on a tuesday at the beginning of march it was not spring break time yet it was very crowded with how much the entry tickets are and the thousands of people that were there i figured disney could afford to have more of the disney characters just walking around strictly for meet and greet pictures one that we did see out and about was mickey we joined the line that had formed but after about minutes another employee walked up stopped at the group in front of me and then told me that the line ended at that group there was my family and another family behind us don t know why they wouldn t stop the line after us two groups and stay there to alert anyone else from joining the line before they joined they only had two disney princess characters available during the time that said they would be there the lines are deceiving they make it look like the line is short but hide half of the line in the props and what not so you can t see how long it actually is aside from the my family still enjoyed our visit there are just things that we learned and know what to do differently whenever we return ,3,2017-03-31
5276,Spring break at Disney,this was our first visit and we can t wait to come back the lines were long but they were worth it every time we did the fast past on some of the rides and that was great the magic morning helped a lot as well with wait times we got to me mickey at his house and moana as well storm troopers this was such a magical vacation ,5,2017-03-31
5277,First visit to Disneyland,after many visits to disney world we made our first trek to southern california to take in disneyland the park is similar to magic kingdom in layout and design the park is clean and safe and has plenty of disney magic the castle is not the scale of cinderella s castle at dw but it is an icon itself being the first if you re a disney fan this is a must because this is the only park walt himself had his hands on there are numerous rides and shows but my favorite thing was near the entrance at the lincoln building you can see the bench and a horse from the carousel that walt sat on when he would take his kids and dreamed up the disney resorts incredible ,5,2017-03-31
5278,Annual Passholders,we love disneyland so much that we go every other month the ap offers discounts free parking and the convenience of special entry days like mickey s halloween party this is inner child therapy on steroids ,5,2017-03-30
5279,Simply magical,there is definitely wonder at the magic kingdom california adventure was great too have to go back halloween parade was awesome,4,2017-03-30
5281,Wonderful World of Standing In Line,the lines are very organized with lots of switchbacks and limited opportunity for cutting the lines also offer prime time for people watching we grew up with the disney fantasies so reality is difficult to embrace ,3,2017-03-30
5282,Expensive place to take a family,disneyland is no longer the happiest place on earth but it is one of the most expensive a two day pass for a family of four is close to the lines are long and the employees are no longer happy to be there a hour visit yields rides save your money and take the kids to the beach he ll enjoy it just as much,3,2017-03-30
5283,Glad that we did not pre-book the tickets online ..., cos daughter was slightly unwell when we arrived at anaheim and had to cut down our theme park time from days to day also it was a wise decision based on wonderful feedback gathered from ta to spend the entire day at disneyland instead of a park hopper ticket to try cover both parks tons of activities in disneyland alone to cover in a single day ,5,2017-03-30
5284,Speaks for itself,how does disneyland not have all star reviews it s honestly a highlight of my month whenever we go every time we find new places to eat and ways to make the day less stressful exhausting they hire perfect employees i honestly never have interacted with any that weren t incredibly pleasant just walking up to the park fills me with happiness because the music they play they ve got nostalgia on lock down can t wait to go again and i m not to mention the character actors are great as you can imagine wonderful with children my daughter adores meeting any of them and it s all she talks about when we get home ,5,2017-03-30
5285,Great place to visit,we love disneyland our kids are and and we had a wonderful couple of days here so many fun rides and great making life long family memories together ,5,2017-03-30
5286,"Crowded, More Broken Rides",although i m a lifelong disney park fan and there s still so much they do right i couldn t help but feel disneyland is going a little downhill in many people including hoteliers and cast members agreed they have never seen the park this busy and we haven t even hit peak times of the year add to the crowds the frequently broken major rides across both ca adventure and disneyland and you have a bunch of disappointed people who want to love disneyland during my day stay sat thru wed we saw all major rides down for hours on end except for pirates thank god on our hottest day wed with temps approaching f both splash mountain and grizzly rapids were down most of the day we experienced many rides chronically open and close within a single day on one day every major ride with a few exceptions was closed for at least an hour with construction for the star wars land walt is cursing in his grave i m sure and huge crowds crowd control was rough from sunset until closing due to parades and fireworks although it s fantastic to have the main st electrical parade back the crazy crowd control patterns are nuts and extremely prohibitive somebody should be studying those to find a better way a tunnel under the castle from tomorrowland to frontierland would solve many problems the main men s bathroom in the bottom half of adventureland was under construction leaving huge lines in frontierland overall whoever is approving crowd control plans should be fired and replaced with someone who understands the patterns the need for bathrooms and parade issues it was painful the groundskeepers are still top notch and cast members are almost uniformly helpful and friendly so there are still things to celebrate but if disney doesn t get on top of crowd control e g triple the local and annual prices the luster could dim ,4,2017-03-30
5287,Be patient!,be there maybe as early as am magic morning isn t magic at all lines are crazy not all rides are open and no restaurant or food stall open early better bring your own food and water use fast pass for popular rides popular rides are open until midnight it is better to wait late at night for those rides ,4,2017-03-30
5288,Quick trip,we did not know it was the beginning of spring break and only did one park the wait times were decent on a weekend but heard the crowds are coming during the week the construction was quiet but virtually half of my favorites were closed no matterhorn no train no rivers of the americas no bumblebee lemon cupcakes guardians of the galaxy will open in may at california adventure so we will invariably be back ,5,2017-03-30
5289,The Photopass was a letdown but still magical,i was given the task of taking my sister brother in law and niece age to disneyland i had never been myself but had been to walt disney world i did my research and thought it would be a visit on par with wdw for the most part it was the system of moving people effectively from parking lots to the park were the same the through effort with a lost lunch at lost and found was exactly the type of dedicated to details that i was expecting cast mates friendly and helpful as well physically going to the attraction for a fastpass was let down but we made that work no fastpasses for meeting characters was disappointing especially with little kids the one aspect i missed out on at wdw was purchasing a photopass this time i made sure to buy ahead of time despite using the app we were only able to find photographers three times all day we were there from am til almost such a disappointment even had the girls hair done at cinderella s boutique no photographers wdw had at least three stationed there in comparison i guess if you don t mind the lack of fast passes and were not planning on the photopass it is still a magical place ,3,2017-03-29
5290,Great Again!,disneyland never disappoints the park was clean and the staff was friendly cast members are great especially with the young kids the crowds were heavy but that is to be expected great time we will visit again ,5,2017-03-29
5291,Beware the fine print on 3 day pass!,pros we love disney and the theme parks cons got the day park hopper pass so could go in early one day beware the early admission is not the same as the extra magic hour that is on disney website that is for people staying in disney hotels the park hopper early admission only pertains to certain days and only gets you into the magic kingdom early we mistakenly thought it could get us into either park early then despite the recommendations to get there an hour before park opens to park catch shuttle get through security etc the regular parking at least on the day we went for admission didn t open until just after we waiting at the parking entrance starting at and the line behind us extended to the road don t know where they expected us to park by the time we got to the theme park the line for hyperspace mountain was already minutes what a waste of time ,4,2017-03-29
5292,Mickey should make anyone happy,i m a disney kid at heart so knew that i had to visit disneyland during my trip to cali it was basically as expected really expensive entrance fees crazy long lines lots of parents and kids losing their patience i love disney so i enjoyed it regardless but this park still does not compare to disney world ,5,2017-03-29
5293,Disneyland!!,honestly i come here a lot i don t really think it needs a review because of how cozy and fun it is i literally love everything about disneyland except for maybe occasionally the very long lines but obviously the lines mean people think it s fun ,5,2017-03-29
5294,Disney Spring trip,visited the park during the first week of their spring break week period lines were very long at times the new star wars space mountain was a little disappointing was basically the same ride with a few new videos through out the ride was expecting much more ,5,2017-03-29
5295,Family vacation to Disneyland Anaheim.,visited disneyland for the grand childrens spring break it was quite busy but by using fast pass system you can reduce wait times for exhibits and rides ,4,2017-03-29
5296,Disneyland Anaheim the first and real Disneyland.,my number one recommendation is come early this park on various occasions fills and they stop letting people into it but you have the option of the newer other accompanying park which is not as popular this park was built in the s unlike disney world which is something else i have been going to this park since and always have a good experience anyone who knows disneyland knows there will be lines there have always been lines clear back to when there were special ticket books for the rides comparing it to newer disney built parks simply isn t relevant the food is priced in line with any other amusement place and if you know where to go very cost effective the rides are fun and some do close down to be refurbished so they remain safe the rides were created in conjunction to the creativity of walt disney and his studio and not to emulate the usual amusement park type of ride they have some of those but most of these rides are creative and were built more with children in mind rather than adults but they have rides for all and there have been many changes over the years expect to have an enjoyable time when you go to disneyland i m going back this weekend to celebrate my th birthday there i m excited and looking forward to it because even for someone my age there is something for all and i look forward to seeing their awesome electrical parade ,4,2017-03-29
5297,Happiest Place on Earth!,the indiana jones ride will always be my favorite but then again so is its a small world and space mountain prices are going up again but that will never stop from me visiting the best theme park on the west coast ,5,2017-03-29
5298,Loveeee,i love disneyland i have been twice now and have just taken my family back for their first experience this time was slightly disappointing the parade got cancelled because it was sprinkling rain lots of rides were down parking a pram at the beginning of a wait line takes a toll on your arms holding a heavy baby for up to hr but none the less we had a good day despite these few things the food was yummy reasonably priced the rides we did get on were fun and exciting and we got to meet mickey mouse darth vader i do wish though there were more characters walking around there weren t many at all ,4,2017-03-28
5299,I loved Disneyland,disneyland is such an amazing place i thought the entrance was expensive but when i got to be inside i understood why the employees are so nice always smiling and treating you right the lines for some games can be long but the wait is worth the only thing i disliked was that during the month i went they don t have the parade at night ,5,2017-03-28
5300,"clean, great for kids, but long lines",staff very nice but line ups horrendous even in february day pass of us is expensive and food also ridiculously expensive we were there in torrential downpour and there was nowhere covered to eat because they said it s california really so freezing eating outside unless you reserved a restaurant the day before with penalty for no show and set menus rides ok my rd time so i m done with disneyland but i give them marks for very clean no smokers no sadness or reality ie homeless beggars dog poop and architecturally very well done stood in line for frozen musical and was canceled with no front of line to return later meant i never saw it crowds horrendous during nightly parade meant impossible to get from one side to the other ,3,2017-03-28
5301,Overrated - extremely crowded!,would never go back i am a senior and went with my six year old grandson and year old daughter we were all disappointed highly overrated there was not a single ride store washroom that we didn t have to line up for i expected this but did not expect the pushing and shoving and the excess number of strollers for a thursday between until pm all of us including my grandson were so glad to see the exit i have been to tokyo and can tell you honestly that tokyo during rush hour has nothing on disneyland truly a waste of money sorry but that s my opinion i did see lots of grumpy people that looked like they were experiencing the same type of day ,2,2017-03-28
5302,First visit,coming from orlando my biggest thing was that this park wasn t going to compare a lot of my friends always said this disney was way better i was surprised at how small the parks were but the convenience of being able to walk from park to park beats waiting for buses like back in orlando the castle always made my girlfriend faint from how tiny it was compared to the magic kingdom one the rides here i will say are waaaaaaaayyyy better than wdw indiana jones space mountain ect all were way more fun than i expected personally i loved how small and close together the two parks were i can see why people say they like this one better ,4,2017-03-28
5303,Not as Good as DisneyWorld but awesome anyway,if you like disney you must visit disneyland at least once and ride as many rides as possible this was our bucket list trip the issues we had is that disneyland park is not as clean as disneyworld there are not as many bathrooms and because the park is smaller and has less in it it seems much more crowded than it is you must ride the classic rides its a small world pirates haunted mansion etc just to see the differences from the ones in orlando the place is beautiful the people that work there are great and it is an overall awesome place to visit ,5,2017-03-28
5304,Meh...,here s the thing if you are going with your young kids they will love it we walked miles days in a row and not a peep or complaint out of my year old everything was exciting and fun to her honestly for the money i wish they would limit the number of entrants per day hour waits at popular rides is just insane there are lines upon lines to get into lines yes we went during spring break which is a very busy time there were also several main attractions rides closed which makes the ticket price a little harder to swallow we waited in line for over an hour for rodger rabbit and then the ride broke food is what you would expect at an amusement park overpriced and a mediocre the sit down places are actually ok a little pricey but not as bad as i would have thought one thing perhaps we missed it but there is no alcohol at the eateries here seriously mom and dad could use a margarita or something before getting back in line limit yourself to one day at disney and one say at california adventure how anyone could do parks in one day is beyond me get there early ,3,2017-03-28
5305,Long Long long wait times,to experience any ride minimum wait time was hour even on the fast pass it told us to come back hours later two hours into trip we left never to return no wonder parents and kids have meltdowns ,1,2017-03-28
5307,Too many people., minute wait for pirates of the carribean splash mountain bobsleds and thunder mountain were all down not too many characters around not too impressed just a big waste of time and money ,3,2017-03-27
5308,Happiest place on earth,i haven t been to this disneyland park since i was a teenager which is more than decades ago a lot has changed especially the price of the park go for the attraction you want to get into first and get a fast pass be aware of the time you can your next one as soon as you are allowed even if you haven t used your current fp yet this shortened the waiting time for us for quite a few rides it was unfortunate that it was spring break so there were a lot of people in the park but we were still able to get on a lot of rides rides seem to break down quite often though but most resume after a few minutes except for the astro blaster which they just shut down since it was almost park closing time already it was a fun tiring day and still the happiest place on earth for kids ,5,2017-03-27
5309,Just too crowded,spring break crowds and closed attractions left this trip with very few good memories a song ran through my head as we waited endlessly for tickets admission attractions meals drinks the bathroom lines lines everywhere a line blockin out the scenery breakin my mind wait here wait some more can you believe the lines ,2,2017-03-27
5310,Fun times!,we went to disneyland this march and it was packed while i know disneyland is older and smaller it definitely felt cramped and felt like they were not quite prepared for the large crowds many rides broke down while we were there which was frustrating after waiting in line the highlights included toon town hyperspace mountain indiana jones trials of the temple big thunder mountain and splash mountain we loved meeting darth vader pocahontas cruella de ville and alice and the mad hatter great character interactions and the staff everywhere was excellent ,4,2017-03-27
5311,Electrical parade is great,i go a lot but with the electrical parade there for a limited time crowds are large and people sit on the curb as early as two hours before the parade choose the later pm show especially on sunday night for less crowds and stay at the main street circle since the nd parade starts there and afterwards you get a jump to the parking lot tram if there are horde of people waiting for the tram to mickey and friends parking structure you can always choose to walk to the parking via downtown disney it is about minutes walk depending on your walking speed bakery near the winnie the pooh ride has a lot less people and they have many of the same electrical parade items to eat there as the main street bakery fireworks is the th anniversary version that disney has brought back be sure to see mickey s magical map show visit mickey s house in toon town and take a photo with mickey and his steamboat for the backdrop,5,2017-03-27
5313,Happiest Place on Earth,very busy long lines that move reasonably well and not a grumpy person around ok we did find one we had a wonderful time and the kids miss it already ,5,2017-03-27
5314,Fun for All ages,we had a great time will visiting disneyland the kid had a blast and it was a great place to have fun everyone who works there is helpful and friendly the characters where amazing it was a lot of fun to watch them interact with the little ones make sure you get a map so that you can plan out where you want to go and if you have little kids where the bathrooms are a great thing is the fast passes it is a great thing when you don t want to wait in line but want to go on that ride ,4,2017-03-26
5315,Not the happiest place on earth!,let me preface this review by saying disneyland opened when i was so my expectations and excitement were higher than usual a huge disappointment no happy characters greet you at the gate or were ever in sight two to three hour waits for rides food was horrid shops redundant we left within three hours a miserable experience for one would expect to be at least mildly entertained ,2,2017-03-26
5316,Family trip,i actually really love disneyland however the customer service on this trip was horrible for price you pay for absolutely everything i would expect better service just one example was while i know it was raining and it is expected to be wet everywhere i didn t want to sit in a huge puddle so i didn t slide all the way over on the jungle cruise boat and i said i didn t want to sit in the puddle the cast member said then i will have some escort you out so my year old my year old mom and myself were embarrassed and escorted off we exited out and walked right back on within the first few minutes ,3,2017-03-26
5317,Happiest Place on Earth!,by far my favorite place in the states rides parade fireworks and characters all around the cast members are genuinely happy to work there and to see guests having fun it s impossible to not smile at nearly every corner while there ,5,2017-03-26
5318,"A must see, but use caution$$",this is nearly identical to magic kingdom in orlando concessions are astronomically high for a coke for a bowl of gumbo etc very crowded mid week similar to holidays in orlando add smog and worse traffic than orlando ,3,2017-03-26
5319,Amazing,went yesterday and took us a whole day to go on all the rides minus a couple of kiddie rides as there was adults and a teen line wait times were really good the longest was minutes but it seemed only minutes fast passes are around and do not require money to purchase it s pretty much first in first serve do your research and download the disneyland app magical experience and very happy faces around the whole entire park cast members were great i do recommend taking a day pass so you can enjoy seeing all the charadcters and the shows ,5,2017-03-26
5320,Much Fun!,my kids loved every single minute of it need more pram access but characters were very friendly and nice to my children and the whole family looked great in the pictures with there disney hats and mickey ice creams defiantly coming back,5,2017-03-26
5321,Incredible - Stick Around Until the End`,disneyland truly is the happiest place on earth i would highly recommend waiting around for the parade and nightly fireworks they are more than just a spectacle in the sky the music performance and props make it truly moving its hard not to shed a tear with happiness ,5,2017-03-26
5322,Good Park-plenty of characters and rides,my first impressions of this resort were not the best whilst i appreciate the enhanced security which is there to protect everybody in the park some restricted items seem silly i have a go pro with the official way tripod stick which i had to remove and throw away i had the option to return this to my hotel but as my walk to the park already took mins i didn t want to waste anymore time there are no lockers available pre security so if there is something you are not allowed to take in you are faced with a difficult decision either dispose of it or waste part of your day returning it to your hotel or car fair enough you can check the rules and terms and conditions before turning up which i would advise if you have any sort of large luggage or camera equipment the park was fairly busy and we visited on a wednesday i would avoid the weekends or school holidays i would recommending using the free fast pass service for the most popular rides or you will have long queue s ask the guest services about where the characters will be this will save you time looking around for them the photo pass that they offer for is really good value you get digital downloads of all of the photos taken throughout the day including ride photos which is really good many rides were closed for refurbishment but that didn t stop us from having a great day the corn on the cob s are really tasty ,4,2017-03-25
5323,Fun!,i had a great time at disneyland park so much fun looking around and feeling like you were in a different place jungle cruise indiana jones splash mountain tomorrowland rides are all so fun definitely stay for the electric parade at pm or pm and watch the fireworks in between so much fun and feels magical ,5,2017-03-25
5324,Might want to hold off,i haven t been to disneyland in years my favorite attractions are tom sawyer s island the mark twain steamboat pirates of the caribbean the matterhorn and the railroad that runs around the perimeter of the park all were closed in rehab all of those but the matterhorn were down while they construct that star wars themed land that should open beyond frontierland until then there s just too much interference during construction i love disneyland but my next visit will happen when there isn t so much that has been closed to visitors ,3,2017-03-25
5325,Spring Break,disney is disney yeah it s really getting pricey but what are you gonna do can t help but to go there whenever i get the chance the park does feel a little more crowded when two major rides are closed in my case it was pirates and the matterhorn not good that lead to looooong lines everywhere else ,5,2017-03-25
5326,Truly is the happiest place on earth,i just love going to disneyland the whole family enjoys it there is a lot of walking with the little kids but we usually stay at hotel close to the park so we can take a lunch break and have the skids rest and usually comes back before the night shows start places to stay besides disney hotel that are fun and affordable are howard johnson and castle inn they are about minutes walk to the main entrance bring sweater for the night show since it s get chilly at night even on the summer nights no discounts for the tickets but if you have the target red card you can buy disney gift card with increment and get off the use the gift card to purchase the ticket ,5,2017-03-25
5327,Disappointing,so yeah first i am not one of those crazy disney people but we have been to disneyworld and now disneyland it was spring break while we were here so the place was packed but in comparing disneyworld to disneyland the place was dirty the characters were rude most never smiled or made eye contact with anyone multiple rides were broken just a complete disappointment don t care if we ever go there again,3,2017-03-25
5328,Happiest Place on Earth,what do you say about the dis just go here are some tips though get the beignets from new orleans square there delectable wait for the front section of the monorail if it takes an extra minutes so what you ll thank me for the experience go early and or stay late the first and last hour can lead to some short lines ,5,2017-03-25
5329,Fun day,i loved the magical day at smiles all day even with over steps and the rides and characters were great,5,2017-03-24
5330,"It's Disneyland, what else can you say!",the original disney theme park designed by walt disney himself yes i ve heard all the complaints the lines are long the tickets are expensive the food is expensive it s to crowded none of that seems to matter once you get here i ve been going to disneyland for plus years and i m just as sad to leave every time our trip is over the biggest thing is to know what you re doing get to the park exactly when it opens utilize the fast pass system for the big e ticket rides it will save you loads of time why would you ever wait in line for hours when you can grab a fast pass and get on the same ride in minutes check the wait times on the disneyland app and plan your route accordingly if you re smart you can easily get to everything you want to see in days much of the park is currently under construction they are adding star wars land which is going to be awesome fixing several of the older rides and adding a marvel land in the near future so check the website to see what rides are currently open before planning your trip all the information is listed online disneyland is a magical place if you plan ahead you will have a wonderful time don t be one of the mindless sheep standing in line for hours to ride ride ,5,2017-03-24
5331,Amazing,we love disneyland i grew up my whole life going to wdw so disneyland was a whole new experience it felt so much more magical and less crowded ,5,2017-03-24
5332,Very crowded but classic Disney fun,we went on a monday in march hoping for fewer crowds for that day of the week but it s also some people s spring break so i think that made it worse we were there from am when it opened until pm left for about an hour for dinner the crowds are definitely lower in the morning so get there right when it opens crowds pick up around am and are worse around lunch to mid afternoon we used fastpasses but were disappointed that you could only get one at a time they make you wait an hour or so before you can get a fastpass for another ride you also have to return at a certain time window there are lines everywhere expect to wait not just for the rides but for food shops bathrooms walking around even wait in line for a fastpass the congestion especially in new orleans square was the worst strollers and wheelchairs everywhere make it worse a lot of good rides were closed for refurbishment which added to the wait for the rides that were open spacemountain broke down and we missed our fastpass time window and when it reopened there was a minute wait luckily they still honored our fastpass and we only waited about minutes you have to get a spot for the electric parade hours ahead of time once the ropped off spots fill up they will not let you watch the parade from the sidewalk or shops along main street they have dozens of employees whose job is just to keep you from stopping to watch the parade so crowds don t clog the sidewalks another complaint is some of the rides have minute waits but last literally less than minute peter pan snow white most of them in fantasyland doesn t seem worth it disneyland is a lot smaller than disney world s magic kingdom which i m more familiar with still it s a classic and it s fun ,4,2017-03-24
5333,"Classic Disney, love it. but overcrowded",it is very well designed and operated theme park our family had a great time wonderful memories but it is too over crowded disney should figure out some way to limit the number of visitors per day to maximize the disney experience ,4,2017-03-24
5334,Come on It's Disneyland!,the feeling one gets just walking onto main street is hard to describe it s just great yup it can get crowded and hot but just mellow out and soak it all in get there early and have a list of must do items i personally think the sit for hours waiting for a parade is not a good plan as you miss out on so much ,5,2017-03-24
5335,"Expensive , Crowded, and way over hyped, and not happy.",first off they offer no military discount for canadian military this is the first place i have come across in the united states that does not honour canadian military id sad to see that from such a huge company knotts was happy to give our family a discount and thanked me for my service that really felt great anyway we paid our money and then stood in a variety of lines for hours and left we managed to get on rides in our time at the park it was shoulder to shoulder park visitors great for disney really sucked as a visitor kids were super happy to leave and head to flags or knotts my recommendation would be to visit only if you have small kids that are into disney otherwise skip it save a lot of money and go anywhere else really it was bad ,2,2017-03-24
5336,First time visit - Great family vacation,i researched and planned our disney trip for several weeks we made it to rope drop every morning and it was well worth it the lines in the morning were very short smaller crowds and less hassle we were able to see everything and do all the rides in days packed our lunches everyday to save a little money and just enjoyed the experience highly recommended ,5,2017-03-23
5337,"Busy, not all rides working",disneyland is always lots of great fun we were surprised by the quantity of rides undergoing refurbishment while we were visiting the active rides often were temporarily out of service as well it would be useful to know ahead of time which rides are out for scheduled refurbishment peter pan wait said min but in reality it is more like hr so always rely on the time boards or the app overall a great visit the bathrooms are few small often not working the parades did not disappoint are a definite must see overall i think disney could be better isn t worth a star rating ,4,2017-03-23
5338,Getting Around the Park Now Is Brutal Even on Moderately Busy Days,i have a love hate relationship with disneyland i love that they have fast passes but i hate that on busy days you have to navigate from one end of the park to the other and battle hideous bottlenecks that the staff cannot manage properly two good examples are in tomorrowland by startours and pretty much everywhere in adventureland sometimes you couldn t move for minutes then you got hit by a motorized cart or stroller not cool god forbid there was ever a fire you d be trampled we were there on wed march th and friday march th and it was warm and sunny both days wed wasn t bad we could get around okay most ride lines were mins in the morning we utilized fast passes well i buy ridemax everytime i go to make sure i visit certain rides at the right time of day to avoid the bad crowds took an afternoon break and came back to cooler temps and shorter lines in the evening friday was a nightmare totally busy it was still okay getting on the rides though it was almost impossible to see the fireworks on friday night because it was so busy and there was zero spots to see the electrical parade at so we had to wait for the show but got a great spot on a bench hyperspace mountain had a hour fastpass return time by noon only rivaled by the cars ride over at california adventure on both wed and fri pinocchio s daring journey broke down on us just as we got to the front as did indiana jones we were able to get priority entry to indiana jones again later that same day when it was back up on friday we managed to ride pirates of the caribbean in the morning when the wait was only mins when we came out it was an hour and a half it s always popular but it just reopened the day before after being closed for months so it was crazy i must say we all enjoyed the refurb pet peeves strollers everywhere everywhere i saw kids that looked years old in strollers please consider that strollers take up the physical space of people surely this should be factored into the physical space that disneyland has it s not the number of people it s the number of strollers i would pay extra for a stroller free visit the handicapped lines aka the line budders i understand that there are people who are physically or mentally challenged that needed those lines but i saw a teenage girl with a brace on her knee and her friends skip the line then two overweight adults not on motorized carts don t even get me started on those then entire families with small children that all looked able bodied and capable of waiting in line it just got to be too much i get it there are always reasons why people can t wait in line then don t go or go off season if you have special needs why make busy times even busier ugh let s face it this place is a victim of its own success this is a year old park that wasn t built for the volume of people they get they need to start limiting how many people they let in the park i believe they do have a rough limit or so depending on the day season and implement a ride system similar to universal where you pay more to avoid the lines california adventure i think is designed better to handle the crowds i m just glad i planned ahead and lucked out on some things ,3,2017-03-23
5339,Over crowded,the kids had a great time but what they missed was the old days of getting to ride on almost every ride they must of had the park filled to compacity as it was packed wall to wall people and very hard to move we got to ride on a total of rides with of them fast track how can a family nowadays afford to pay with gas food parking etc and go on rides and say it was a successful day that s a ride disneyland has forgotten what it was originally built for familys to have fun and enjoy the day what a rip ,1,2017-03-23
5340,President's Week with Our Grandson at Disneyland!!!,this week is a madhouse since most kids have a day weekend or all week off we came down from sacto area in our motor home with out ten year old grandson due to show and hour differences during winter visits we went to disneyland on sunday very crowded and we were there early we were able to get to ian s favorite rides related to star wars buzz light years autopia we don t run to rides but did walk fast to tomorrowland and did get the first or rides with short waits go a couple of fast passes and all was good after first two hours waits got much longer with waits over minutes to minutes it stayed long lines for rides shows and food for the rest of the day people were saving curb space by mid afternoon for the electric parade we got our spots in a less crowded area hrs early of all our trips here over the last years and our th pres week this was the most crowded there seemed to be too many people in the park seems like they need to consider limiting number of people allowed in especially as much as they charge for tickets now ,4,2017-03-23
5341,Disneyland WAS the happiest place on earth,this was my son s first visit to disneyland and he had a blast they joy and excitement i witnessed in him as we made our way through the park brought true happiness to me he had just as much fun and enjoyment on the little old rides and attractions as he did on the bigger signature rides and attractions it was just a fantastic day i can t wait to take him back ,5,2017-03-23
5343,Wonderful Disneyland,we had a wonderful time there were of us celebrating our great granddaughters th birthday disneyland does everything right if i was asked for a suggestion i would say i think more park benches in the park hard for older visitors due to the walking required need places to rest ,5,2017-03-22
5344,Fun day in California,disneyland is nice but small not nearly as big as disney world a lot of rides consistently broken down during the day smaller park so it feels crowded ,4,2017-03-22
5345,Fantastic,i had taken my granddaughter to disneyland for surprise birthday she was definitely excited and enjoyed every minute of it the entry price is alot especially if you have a family of four or more i paid usd each for day park pass we were able to see the whole of disneyland in day as the cues were smaller than probably modt days bit of luck really thank you for making my granddaughters birthday one fantastic memorable experience ,5,2017-03-22
5346,It's Disneyland!,yes it s crowded yes the lines are long yes it s overpriced yes the food isn t the greatest but it s disneyland it s still magical and fun my year old daughter and i spend hours there walked almost miles and will smile at the memories for the rest of our lives i d go back today again if i could ,5,2017-03-22
5347,lots to see,for the first timers this was a great place to start very expensive to purchase things and the crowds are very bad but it s disneyland expected ,5,2017-03-22
5348,Had a blast,we went with our yr old twins and yr old son we had such a blast the parks were close together and easy to access we went in august and the lines were surprisingly reasonable def recommend for parents with littles even more so than the florida park ,5,2017-03-22
5349,"All Disney, all queues",place looks fantastic it s like a fairytale for us born in the s and s or earlier for younger it seemed to be more like an experience not once in a lifetime event you can feel the disney everywhere but of course you need to queue first queues are the thing that puts this place down there aren t that many rides and those exist queues were from to minutes and we were visiting off season and middle of the week for those seeking adventures roller coasters and other rides this is not the place to come for those living the childhood dream of disneyland this is absolutely the place to be biggest disappointment was the monorail sure it was nice ride in some ways but most of the time you can see from the window only the backyards of technical buildings of disneyland and those also for a very short time due to the speed for that waiting an hour seemed little bit too much ,3,2017-03-22
5352,Great theme park for the whole weekend,i went to both parks disneyland park and california adventure pros good parking structure rides attractions snacks cons too many people good food hard to find price waiting times for rides overall it s a great park but it s not perfect this was my first time you need to visit at least three days to be satisfied otherwise you ll miss some cool rides due to waiting time to get in food is bad inside the park i got sick the whole time due to all the snacks i ate i like how they have the parking layout and very organized as well as taking the tram to the parks for socal residents i encourage you to get the day deal because it s worth it ,4,2017-03-21
5353,Too many breakdowns......,very disappointed that so many rides activities were not available during our visit had we been informed in advance we would have never booked our visit during spring break the railroad pirates of the caribbean fantasmic matterhorn etc were all closed rides kept breaking down continually especially indiana jones and the haunted mansion ,3,2017-03-21
5354,Best family vacation!,awesome to come back as an adult with our children the park was busy as usual wednesday was the less busiest day my kids had an awesome time ,5,2017-03-21
5355,Great for smaller kids,we just got back from our ca trip i can finally say i ve been to both disneys disney world can be a little overwhelming due to the size i would say the disneyland parks are just the right size for days ,5,2017-03-21
5356,Monorail Goofup Turned Happiest Place on Earth to Saddest,we visited the happiest place on earth on match and it is widely known by all including disney that this week was spring break in arizona and other states that people flock from to go to dl tuesday the th was extremely crowded and hot guess what only monorail running that day why my wife s back was really hurting her so she was going to take monorail back to downtown disney to go to our room at the dl hotel and walk she waited hour before she was able to take the monorail disney is usually known for having their ducks in a row and all their bases covered not this time with only monorail operating at this very very busy time is very poor planning ,1,2017-03-21
5357,Not such a happy place...,my first visit experience this place is super duper crowded and so freaking expensive i had very high expectations and was very disappointed we spent days here and every single day was horrible due to how crowded it was we literally spent like an hour waiting for rides that were each less than minutes long i cannot understand why the disney company would allow so many people to enter the park and let it become hell on earth i cannot believe people put up with such bs from disney with how pricey those entrance tickets are i always heard that the park is always clean and bathrooms too nope thats not accurate there was so many people that those bathrooms were pretty filthy i cannot understand why the food which is of cheap quality would be so expensive there is not many places where you can sit and rest also we tried watching the parade and fireworks but there was nowhere to go and see it many people take up all the good viewing spaces for the parade and fireworks a few hours prior to the show so if you want to see it from a good place make sure you are there at pm on our third and final day we had given up on this family vacation we left early to our hotel and decided to just rest from all the horrible things that happened at disney never again disney first and last time visiting unless they can change and find a solution for the overcrowding issue ,1,2017-03-21
5358,Nothing else like it. Have been at least 20 times and don't even live in California!,great for all ages i loved it as a child teen young adult on my honeymoon and with children and grandparents ,5,2017-03-20
5360,Traditional and Reliable,always excellent standards here consistency is so nice for making memories can t wait for the upcoming attractions ,5,2017-03-20
5361,Disappointed Visit at Disneyland 2017,was disappointed this year on our trip to disneyland this year we celebrated their th anniversary in but this year was less than stellar some of the really good ride was closed for refurbishment this included the matterhorn grizzly railroad mark twain s paddle boat ride on the plus side they brought back the electric parade haven t seen that in years the frozen show was worth the wait it was definitely a hoot for everyone young and old the food was great especially the corn dogs we were disappointed with the terrace italian restaurant when we approached for dinner they advised we should book ahead i asked how would we know to book ahead we were tourists anyway despite the issues it is always a good trip to disneyland ,3,2017-03-20
5362,Great for kids.,we had a great time at the park but it was a little more crowded than we expected but the lines were still not too long of a wait most lines went much faster than the stated waiting time ,4,2017-03-20
5363,Birthday weekend,we surprisingly got through quite a bit during our day there it was hot and busy but we didn t wait more than minutes for anything as we utilized the fast pass system ,4,2017-03-20
5364,Crowds out of Control,had a decent time still as it is the magic of disney but the crowds are becoming intolerable everything in the park runs seamlessly in terms of cleanliness and service except when it comes to crowds we went on a sunday and there were parts of the park where foot traffic came to a halt for extended periods of time in the hours we were there i was hit by strollers and electric wheelchair i don t know why disney doesn t at least assign some if it s many staff to help manage crowd control and direction of traffic if they are going to jam the parks to the brim we were only able to go on rides even with fast passes making each ride cost each for two people in the rides where fast passes were not available we waited minutes we were not even allowed throw money at any of the restaurants because they were taking reservations only while we saw that reservations could be made online the day before there was nothing to indicate that they were required when we were able to purchase food from the casual cafes there was no place to sit we took our tray to another area where we found half a bench in addition some popular attractions such as the matterhorn were closed really love the rides and charm that the park has to offer but it s becoming too straining on patience to come here may just avoid the park altogether next time and only go to downtown disney i m sure if you planned your trip out on strategic days reservations and wait times ran and pushed people when you could you would be able to hit some type of agenda in the park even with the crowds but it is just not worth it for us it seems you need to be very determined and very well researched on park strategy to come here now ,3,2017-03-20
5366,Disneyland is no longer worth you hard earned money,my wife and i visited disneyland today we tend to visit every few years but this will be the last visit until things change it s always busy but today was impossibly busy likely due to spring break but if this were any other business it would be shut down for being over occupancy numbers this is a tragedy waiting to happen there is literally no space to walk especially as ride lines become extended and further block available walking space god forbid someone had an emergency or some major event happened what i truly don t understand is why they be doing repairs on some rides if they know this is the busiest time of the year also they claim to raise the prices in the busy season but i m not at all convinced this is really done to reduce crowds if they wanted to reduce crowds that would simply put quota on ticket sales and guests entering the park force people to make reservations lottery if necessary and reduce same day ticket sales entries the park was an overcrowded mess today with rides closing down constantly we had a stretch where we went to rides consecutively with fast passes and each ride was closed down for repairs lines weaving everywhere it was often very difficult to try to understand where the line actually started long lines for food and bathrooms etc it was comically annoying and actually quite pathetic and i kept wondering why i had paid so much for this it felt very overrated disney badly needs to stop thinking about only making money and actually try to think about providing a quality experience again and this will begin with crowd control as far as i can tell they currently don t have any quotas or restraints on park entries and the fastpass system broke down today on multiple occasions the park just couldn t handle the number of people within its boundaries and the most popular rides were pushed to their brink which ultimately led to many breakdowns as for me i will be spending my money elsewhere this has become the tourist trap of all time tourist traps ,2,2017-03-20
5367,Beautiful,had a family day there for the first time and it was beautiful the star wars section was indeed my favorite rides were great and i dont even like roller coaters haha the parade was beautiful aswell we did go on the weekend so it was packed would of loved to ride more rides but it was indeed a great trip ,5,2017-03-20
5368,8 year old and 2 year old,disney thinks of everything from switch pass to fast pass to places where little ones can burn off that extra energy definitely a place that caters to a family with such a wide gap in age ,5,2017-03-19
5369,Full of people,the park is always full and the waittring time is all the time over minutes and all the time there is no seats or something where you can rest ,3,2017-03-19
5370,A Classic that Stays Fresh,this was disneyland s th anniversary celebration good food turkey leg the parade was nice but get a spot early it was a convention evening pass so lines limited ride attempts went with nemo for a slow one and indiana jones for an active one good choices the best things for an older dude like me are the photo ops and the main street shops too much shake rattle and roll is not good worth the visit ,4,2017-03-19
5371,Great Visit,we have been to disney world numerous times and disney paris we thought it was time to visit where it all started we all enjoyed the park you get your classic disney rides rides that i remember from when i was young but have closed at disney world like mr toad s wild ride and snow white s scary adventures and of course there are the new rides that are also great the new pirate s of the caribbean opened on our last day and it was fantastic my only negative is that disney needs to invest some money into their older rides to make them more reliable we spent a lot of wasted time in line we would get to the front of the line where there were only a few parties waiting to get onto the ride in front of us and then the ride would close due to technical difficulties this happened to us on pinocchio haunted mansion mr toad s wild ride and big thunder mountain railroad we did get a pass to ride another ride when this happened on haunted mansion or at least we thought we did they load it onto one ticket from your party but when we went to use it the ride person said there was nothing on any of our tickets ,5,2017-03-19
5372,Lineups and Closed Attractions,top attractions matterhorn railroad riverboat and several others are closed for refurbishment they need it as they keep stopping evacuation procedures are awful needing more than a half hour to get people off a stopped ride they don t advise about the closed rides before you buy a ticket but that is part of the disney culture grab as much money as they can there are lots of other people who will keep the lineups full you need lots of patience and ways to entertain kids in hour long lineups ,2,2017-03-19
5373,Very disappointed with sad kiddos!,we recently went to disney for the first time as a family i knew that going over spring break would mean long lines and more people but i was very disappointed with just how many people we had day passes our first day we entered the park at open and when we had left we had made it on rides and seen characters we were there hours it was ridiculous it was so packed we could barely get food to eat visit gift shops for souvenirs and definitely couldn t do many rides wait times were minutes and fast passes were sold out till pm i m very sad and disappointed that disney doesn t put some kind of cap on how many people can be in the park at one time it definitely wasn t the happiest place on earth ,2,2017-03-19
5374,Spring Break = Too Many People,just returned from a disney trip during our spring break the family had been to the orlando parks a few times but had not been to los angeles thank god for the extra time in the park extra magic hours that came with staying in a disney hotel we did the majority of what we wanted to do between am star tours was great pirates was closed the day we were there so we didn t get to see the revised ride the park is in really good shape disney is still magical but the place shows its age in the narrowness of its walkways by am the place was packed and it is overrun with strollers and scooters we will not go again during any school holiday ,4,2017-03-19
5375,"Mostly good times, but fave rides were shut down and it was so crowded!!",we had fun for sure but with the train that runs the perimeter closed down we couldn t rest our legs and still get to some of the furthest places in the park plus last time we were there pirates was closed and now it was closed again so we still haven t been on that ride plus the matterhorn was also closed so we didn t get to ride that past favorite roller coaster but yes we still had fun doing the things that we were able to do even though the crowds were so big and the lines were so long we got a fast pass for indiana jones so that helped some but it was still a long line the revised space mountain now called hyper space mountain was broken down most of the day but got repaired in time for a late night ride with a minute delay due to another breakdown while we were in line but it was fun once we got to it by then it was late and we couldn t make it over to splash mountain without the train so we missed that ride it s still the happiest place on earth but it could have been so much better if things were all working ,4,2017-03-19
5377,Spring Break Crowds were extreme!,we went crowds were extreme i thought it would be a little less crowded but i was wrong we still managed to get in a lot of rides but i missed being able to ride much in tomorrowland only small world and buzz light year very sad that we didn t have the time or energy to stand in line for space mountain and peter pan we also missed autopia and star tours pirates opened last day of our stay and once the worked the bugs out we were able to stand in a minute line for the ride ,4,2017-03-18
5378,Fun for all!,we rented strollers and our year old fell asleep while his big sister rode rides that he was too little for both kids enjoyed the various boat rides and shows we took a second day and just the adults kiddos stayed with grandma went back to ride the bigger rides had a great time ,5,2017-03-18
5379,Amazing place to visit,we had an event in anaheim so we visit disneyland and it was the first time for me i would come back with my family to visit it for sure when i visited i had selfie stick and as per the rules not allowed to have it inside so don t bring your selfie stick with you ,5,2017-03-18
5380,Must See,this isn t as large as the orlando location but it still makes for a great time it is essentially the equivalent of magic kingdom with a lot of rides the fireworks are always a nice touch worth the visit ,5,2017-03-18
5381,It's an amusement park,clean as you can hope for with so many guests property is looked after and attractions are fresh and pleasing with all the hype i half expected gems and gold leaf or personal attendants to dust my shoes after each ride alas it s just an amusement park if you ve been to others this is probably nicer albeit more crowded so many strollers dodging them could be the most challenging event of the day food is good quality but higher in price than warranted healthy choices are always available even for the kiddos be prepared for some rides to be closed for cleaning and refurbishment download the app for all the wait times at your fingertips take advantage of the fastpasses wherever you see them if you have a full day to spend you ll have seen enough a second day isn t needed if you have a second day for amusement spend it at universal or skip land and hit adventure and universal instead ,4,2017-03-18
5382,Easy Day at the Park,instead of the day we visited the park at night so we could see the elusive main street electrical parade it s better than what i remembered a few years ago but some of the attractions were again closed due to problems i m talking specifically about hyperspace mountain which never seems to be open when we are there we rode autopia in the dark but that s not exactly thrilling with the crowds ,4,2017-03-17
5383,Even though it was crowded - fun for all ages.,disneyland is amazing in their ability to manage crowds although we were disappointed that pirates of the carribean and the matterhorn were closed for renovation our year old year old and parents all had an amazing time ,4,2017-03-17
5384,A family fun time.,missed the old style or type of service disneyland used to give yes i can help you get to next ride or store no problem employees in store we went in were outstanding in there help nice touch to many of the employees on rides were just talking to each seems over staff on to many other like they didn t have time to help us to get to next area as some things have changed since we were there last our kids even picked up on this and told us about how they felt about it like they didn t have time for you they just wanted to talk to each other rude staff members so help or lack of it made that what was new and or where we could get our handicap person on this ride or not uncomfortable to say the least to many employees together seemed to just stand around togetherness and talked we did find a few employees at it s a small world to help and goofy kitchen staff was a great help to us we missed the nights fireworks as we didn t know about the time it was taking place and we were coming back from dinner at goofys kitchen wonderful staff clean comfortable as i said and saw the very end we would have gone back sooner if we had got the right answer to what time fireworks display was going to happen we talked as family oh well we saw little of the end from the tram ride back so better then not at all we tried to make the best of all and have wonderful vacation on earth ice cream pineapple treats was great while waiting to get in to see singing birds a must to try and we all loved it worth it oh yes indeed enjoy the jungle ride submarine cars toon town pirates of the caribbean riverboat ride shops once you got into parking garage it was spacious clean comfortable to get into next area to get bags check out and then on a ride over to park all came together long lines to get in to park but that s nothing new we all talked on way home and we will go back but we are going to have to have better service and help on our visit maybe it s not this bad all the time we went away with will give it another try before we say no way universal and warner brothers is so much more fun kids and adults love the fun had at other two places in the past ,3,2018-01-23
5385,The week before Christmas,we took our six year old son to disneyland dec i was afraid of the crowds and congestion neither one really were an issue using fast passes and the disneyland wait time app we saw all that we wanted except the peter pan flight i refused to stand in a line more than minutes the highlight was of course fantasmic and world of color ,5,2018-01-22
5386,Way too crowded,even with the fast pass we could only ride about rides in hours and we decided to leave not to mention power was out for minutes ir more and shut down most rides there were so many people they jmhad to stop letting them in fast pass felt like a scam it was a terrible value for my family of parking took over an hour mot organized getting in the gate took over an hour not very well organized it was a miserable experience ,3,2018-01-22
5387,Swarms of people,i expected the park to be busy but not to the extent that i experienced bottom line they let too many people in would not go back ,2,2018-01-22
5388,Always a Great time,ok so i am a disney fanatic but that is only because its always fun it does seem to be getting busier but that will not stop us going ,5,2018-01-21
5389,"Lines, broken rides and some fun. A one-time trip.",we went at a supposedly less crowded time of year mid january it was our childs first time we stayed at the grand californian which was nice and a good choice though expensive for a wednesday it was pretty crowded though teh fast pass did help alleviate alot of standing in line highly recommend the fast pass as the only way to enjoy the park cough up the there were many rides that were down and many arts of the park were walled off for construction in both parks really there were too many things closed to warrant the high ticket price but you have no choice we did most of disneyland park te first day get there early to be on the good rides the afternoon its almost impossible even with a fast pass we paid the big bucks for the desert party at the world of color in the other park it was worth it and would recommend the carnation cafe has really gone downhill so i d hits the restaurants near pirates for better service and food al in all is sooo much different and less magical than when my wife and i were kids yes spend the and do it once then never again ,3,2018-01-21
5390,Bucket List Dream,took a while but finally made it to disneyland took the family and had the best day ever it sure is close to being the happiest place on earth got to personally meet mickey mouse donald duck and pluto it s also refreshing to see that along with all the junk food you can buy you can also purchase fresh fruits and healthy drinks as well which is what we did we also had a fast pass and two designated tour guides with us the whole time this avoided arguments with kids as to where we went next our guides led the way the entire day and we never had to wait more than mins for a ride amazing amazing,5,2018-01-21
5391,Makes for a good long day out,we arrived at am and stayed until closing and were pretty much able to see everything in the day note if it s theme park rides you are looking for then head to the adventure park but as an experience with some rides and various attractions and activities then this is the place to go plenty to see and do and lines are well managed food and beverage venues are varied and plentiful and generally pretty easy to get a seat fireworks were cancelled the night we were there due to weather but the lights etc are still very good as i said can be done in a day or if you have a three day pass go to disneyland resort and adventure park on one day each then come back on day three for anything you missed but for us one long day was enough to experience disneyland ,5,2018-01-21
5392,34 years since last visit!,i was lucky enough to visit disneyland from australia as a child as was my husband this trip was to continue the family tradition and it did not disappoint we brought our daughters aged and there really is no more magical place in the world i planned carefully before my trip to maximise our time in the park had such an amazing time that we are adding another visit to our canada trip at the end of just have to see the holiday decorations words cannot describe the magic ,5,2018-01-20
5393,All of the food is divine!,golden horseshoe has the corn dogs to die for but they serve theirs with fries the other locations have apples or chips for the same price they also have chili cheese fries that are awesome disney really has some fantastic food definitely try the chocolate covered pineapple yum ,5,2018-01-18
5394,Great atmosphere but the crowd and organization kills it,disneyland was much better experience than california adventure was with our little boy year old less than three year old so he gets in free but still due to the big crowds and queues on a weekday mid january it is not worth it also for us it is a mystery that many of the rides are closed off season disappointing but people love disney and you will i guess always get overcrowded and thereby the ticket price for the small ones i must recommend legoland it was the best experience with no crowds and a lot of rides suitable for those below and has a lot of playgrounds that disney don t have in their concept bad organization from disney side as you need even with the fast pass system to spend most of the time waiting even on a weekday in mid january but if you want to make your little one a little bit happy with some disney flair then choose disneyland over california adventure and consider going to legoland ,4,2018-01-17
5395,The Happiest Place On Earth,well i think disneyland never disappoints this was my third time and so just love the place and would highly recommend going at christmas time as the decorations are spectacular as are the fireworks nightly lots of variety for food and drinks and for first timers would recommend at least to days if you want to see both parks and everything get the disney app as it is wait times on rides and is very helpful and just enjoy the best place on earth ,5,2018-01-17
5396,Disneyland getaway,we took advantage of the day southern california deal in april we knew it would be busy but hey it s a deal wednesday and thursday was not to bad fast passes a must now for friday friday was so crowded we had trouble getting around but this is to be expected it s the happiest place on earth right the staff was wonderful and the park was clean i honestly have no complaints just make sure to research before you go a lot of bad reviews are for ride closers and park closing early may has grad nights where park closes early look at the disney refurbishment schedules this way you know what to expect ,3,2018-01-17
5397,Disney Trip,love disneyland don t love the crowds or the ever raising prices you have to go through security before you enter the park which is fine i wish they had an express lane for people who aren t bringing the house with them into the park between strollers purses and backpacks it takes minutes just to get to the line to show your ticket and get into the park once inside it was very crowded but we bought a each fast pass this allows you to get fast passes from your phone without having to physically going to each ride and waiting in line to put your ticket in to get a fast pass worth the extra cost in reality you should be able to do this for free but disney is in it for the money so we have to suck it up and pay for the privilege despite the crowds we really enjoyed our day finally tried the turkey legs that are so famous it was pretty good but so salty that it tasted more like smoked hamhocks then turkey couldn t finish it the next time i go to disneyland will be during off season so i can enjoy my day without getting ran over by strollers and motorized scooters ,4,2018-01-17
5398,Happiest Place on Earth,can you really say anything bad about disneyland it s the happiest place on earth i know that people complain that rides are closed but come on they have to fix up and maintain the rides for safety and enjoyment if you do your research you will know which rides will be closed for refurbishment before you go also if you go before or after christmas halloween there are going to be rides closed to prep for the holidays just keep that in mind when you plan the park does a great job looking the part for the holidays we had the day hopper pass and were able to go back and forth between both parks i highly recommend getting the maxpass it s totally worth the price in my opinion we got to ride so many rides and never waited in line longer than minutes plus you get all your pictures is it a pricy place to visit yes is it worth it giant yes i was really impressed with of the cast members there is always going to be or grumpy pants but overall they are super friendly and helpful and there is always someone around to answer your questions the characters were awesome i was blown away with how well they interacted with my daughter they never come out of character and they drew out my shy little girl and got her to laugh and smile she was in awe meeting the princesses and when i look at all the pictures the girls seem so genuine and real i know it s a job and they are actors but they do a darn good job of convincing me that they are the real deal they spend a good amount of time with each kid too ,5,2018-01-16
5399,Disneyland Park Hopper Tour with Stone VIP Tours & Tommy!,we visited the parks with our two grandchildren ages on a day the rest of our family including their parents visited universal studios but were in great hands with tommy tommy helped us celebrate our grandson s special birthday going beyond all expectations including a gift of personalized birthday ears arranging for us to be the first family through the gates at toontown for birthday greetings by mickey mouse and a special interaction with an animated crush from finding nemo who sang him happy hatch day just a few highlights out of a wonderful day spent in the parks our normally timid grandson made fast friends with tommy whose advice he trusted to take the plunge and ride space mountain and the matterhorn tommy was equally in tune with our two year old ensuring she enjoyed attractions like disney s jr dance party and the enchanted tiki room show highlights for us all in both cases almost no waiting i don t have a tally of the number of rides and attractions we covered but it was a lot we couldn t believe how we wizzed by and straight onto things while other families stood in long lines waiting up to minutes for many many of the attractions we enjoyed tommy worked diligently on our behalf helped by pushing one of our two strollers or holding our grandson s hand made our lunch reservation choosing a great spot but refusing our invitation to join us even guiding us on the best ice cream for each of the two children great value for the price and we should know having used the official disney tour guide just two days previously with our larger group of that was great but short of getting onto kiddie rides like dumbo that don t offer the fast pass option or arranging special seating and no wait tome for fantasmic world of colour the frozen show this tour is a fabulous option for a fraction of the price we can t recommend using this tour company highly enough thank you tim hammer who also arranged wonderful driver and beautiful van and car seats our airport transfers and travel to lego land and to tommy for helping to make this disney family adventure run so smoothly ,5,2018-01-16
5400,Animated adventure in nostalgia,animated adventure in nostalgia i have explored disneyland since the orange trees were removed and the parking lots were paved always new excitement each time i pass through the gates they have moved dumbo several times but adventure land is very much unchanged yes they evicted the swiss family robinson out of the tree house they carefully built and let some tarzan guy move in but that is the disney spirit of change now princess leia and the star wars gang are moving into what had been the painted desert alway fun we now enjoy just sitting in a restaurant patio and watching the crowds starbucks is is fairly recent addition change nostalgia and attempts to improve on the past what a wonderful place ,5,2018-01-15
5401,Blast,we had a blast at disneyland it was more crowd usual longer wait for all the rides but we had a wonderful time ,5,2018-01-15
5402,Always magical,been to disneyland multiple times but never with max pass i am pretty but conscious but think it is worth it especially on busy days went on indy minutes after park opened and while in line reserved a fastpass for space mountain minutes after ropedrop rode both jungle cruise and pirates then reserved next fastpass while exiting ride rode thunder on way over space and reserved third pass matterhorn did buzz and small world even though park was busy we were able to stay a step ahead of crowd fastpasses guardians and had lunch while waiting for ride fastpasses soaring and did racers single rider fastpasses buzz while inside soaring by we were ready for break so watched frozen fastpassed star tours while watching play went to hotel to swim and fastpassed big thunder from hotel went back to park for star tours thunder fantasmic then over to world of color to end the day fit bit steps but never stood in lines even though some standby were up to hours long get maxpass ,5,2018-01-14
5403,Most Magical Place on Earth!,disneyland is a great spot for people of all ages there are restaurants rollercoasters virtual games and more i recommend going the price is worth it,5,2018-01-13
5404,Letting The Inner Children Run Free,disney knows how to treat their quests they have done a great job in maintaining this as an older amusement park they have lots of rides that appeal to all of the age groups the rides have stayed relatively modern and maintained parking and shuttles are managed very well to get you from your vehicle to the park there is lots of places to eat and buy souvenirs there are parades that showcase old and present disney themes there are also many pitfalls the lines can be extremely long and you will spend more time waiting then on the rides during the peak hours it can be hard to even move in areas of the park the cost of food is extremely expensive although well maintained the rides are aging as are a number of the attractions in some cases with themes being very antiquated ,3,2018-01-13
5405,Spent our 36th Wedding Anniversary here,we had such a fun day riding all the key rides space mountain is still a must and star tours was great also ,5,2018-01-12
5406,Tried and True,our family has been going to disneyland since it began my wife even met mr disney on day of the park s opening when he was greeting guests as they came in have to say after having been to disney world years ago we tookj a hiatus from disney as we thought the magic may be gone disney world for us was nothing but work and stress in a ridiculously hot and humid climate it was so crowded as to be ridiculous so we planned our trip to disneyland for our grandaughter s d birthday with care we went on what was projected to be one of the quieter days of the year in early december everything was perfect the park was reasonably crowded we managed our fast passes well which allowed us to avoid any long lines everything was perfect from the character interaction no lines just characters on the street as opposed to disney world where you feel like you are waiting in long lines just for a photo op for the kids when we were there there was a hour wait just for a minute meet and greet with the frozen girl our grand kids met every character they wanted to meet and the time it took to do so was minimal at disneyland oh one thing you may want to do is avoid the extra price for park hopper tickets we were thoroughly entertained for a full day at disneyland and then we spend the next full day at california adventure i would recommend that you do the parks in this order because after a day at fast paced disneyland it is nice to go to the little more laid back california adventure park all in all we had a perfect trip disneyland resort yes disney world run ,5,2018-01-12
5407,Happiest Place on Earth,title says it all it s was absolutely the happiest place on earth don t miss out and get the max pass you get all your fast pass selections on your phones and pictures with the disney photographers is included ,5,2018-01-11
5408,Still Disneyland,there are many things that i still remember from coming here as a child the rides are fun as are the parades and characters totally worth the money for the fast pass on the app we all enjoyed our time here and we were a group with ages between and ,4,2018-01-10
5409,All i can say is MAGICAL!,this was my first time to disneyland and the word magical comes to life here the experience was spectacular from start to finish i was out of words to say because of how fun and exciting this experience was it is a place i am coming back to every year from that moment on pretty pricy but that didn t matter anymore my cheeks were sore because i been smiling so much every where we walked from the disney part to california adventures cant wait to come back in december its an attraction that is worth your money and time ,5,2018-01-10
5410,Not Enough Amusement,park is too small and old not a lot of exciting things to do comparing to world disney s in orlando florida downtown disney s is so small and nothing much to see or do ticket price is very expensive better off to go to florida a vacation package of air hotel and car rental for days is affordable than just to purchase an air fare to anaheim california ,3,2018-01-08
5411,A childhood dream realised!,definitely a dream to visit disneyland and i was not disappointed if this is your first time do your research about shows and times etc before heading to the park a beautiful magical place,5,2018-01-08
5412,Magical!,i visited disneyland on christmas day and with all of the holiday festivals it was sooooo magical hands down this has been the best experience of my life so far it s beautiful magical mesmerizing and unique photos and video can never capture what you feel and experience within when you visit this place i just loved it,5,2018-01-08
5413,Happiest Place on Earth Indeed!,you need a couple of days to really enjoy this huge amazing place lots of rides activities restaurants food kiosks restrooms shops everything though always crowded and the best rides usually have long queues still worth it disneyland is the place where no matter how many times you have been there already you still get excited to come back ,5,2018-01-08
5414,Where’s the Magic and Fantasy??,nice that s all i am able to say i think this land of fantasy is in great disney magical hands dirty old lack of sparkle long lines over crowded colorless and flowerless also where are the disney characters only minnie mouse was found the entire day my suggestion is close the park for a while and renovate restore and make it what disney stands for p s the fountain outside the haunted mansion should not only have plain water in it but it should have red colored water to make it more exciting and true to the haunted mansion style ,2,2018-01-07
5415,"It was ok, but not my cup of tea.",it s extremely busy in disneyland park and much easier to get about in disneyland california found the lines extremely long and fast track not to be amazing also wifi was worthless which sucks for non usa citizens ,3,2018-01-06
5416,The happiest place on Earth,i have dreamed of coming to disneyland ever since i can remember in my years on earth and finally had the chance to bring my wife and children this year due to my age much of the fun fare and desire to go on some of the rides has diminished however the look in my children s eyes showed me that theirs had not as a parent i would have liked to see more amenities as well as more shaded or covered areas around waiting cues for rides as the best part of both days we were there was spent waiting in line was disheartened to have our backpack stolen while i sat and waited for my wife and children to go on a ride as it only had items that were valuable to us such as souvenirs but there were several staff members who gave us badges and discounts when we repurchased these items for our children all in all they were great days with the family and i would have to say that i believe day would not be enough to make sure you see everything between the parks and or more days would definitely be too long ,4,2018-01-06
5417,Walls of people,we were here with our kids high school band who performed in the rose parade it was december th and i do not recommend ever coming this time of year the holiday lights and decorations were beautiful but the massive amounts of people were insane not even worth trying to get in line for anything way way too long restrooms very hard to find even with the map also as someone who isn t familiar with the rides there is no description of what kind of ride it is on the map or at the ride entrance only a health warning on more extreme rides ,3,2018-01-06
5418,Amazing Experience,we recently visited with our year old son and year old daughter we were there in mid december and the christmas theme made it feel even better being there we had three days all up and still didn t get to experience all to see at the park but what we did see was great plenty of places to eat and we had a magic morning that was awesome as we got to go on over rides before the park filled up fireworks were great a wonderful way to complete the day we had an issue with our passes and the customer service personnel were very helpful ,5,2018-01-06
5419,During Christmas Holiday,probably not fair to rate disney when its wall to wall people during christmas holidays but thats the only time we could go no complaints we had a great time despite the long lines everyone was friendly ,5,2018-01-05
5420,Family New Year's Day trip to Disneyland,disneyland is always a great experience it was less crowded on new year s day we were able to do everything we wanted without much waiting ,5,2018-01-03
5421,"Great time had, very tiring!",visited mid week in december and it was thoroughly enjoyable and very quick to get on rides the longest we were in a queue was to actually purchase tickets i m not sure why that took so long as people seemed to be at the counter for what seemed forever whilst it was very busy it wasn t unbearable we managed to go on the rides we wanted and get fast passes for the rides where the wait was crazy small world car park and shuttles were easy to get around we spend almost hours here and still didn t see everything tip maybe have stroller free days ,4,2018-01-03
5422,A TRUE DREAM!,visited disneyland december rd not too crowded everything was perfect everyone we encountered were super helpful and friendly truly a magical experience ,5,2018-01-03
5423,I wanted to be cynical...,i wanted to be cynical i wanted it to be too disney too much too manufactured and maybe disney is that but it s so much more cynicism evaporated in about the first seconds and suddenly i was a kid again i event went to minnie mouses house service top notch food surprisingly good and relatively decent value for what you are getting maybe it is the most magical place on earth word to the wise though unless you are a real people person consider visiting at a time that does not coincide with new years eve but hey if i could survive you probably could to ,5,2018-01-02
5424,Do your homework and use the app.,we went on the one of the busiest days of the year surf the net and plan your days in disneyland tip use the app it s a bit clunky until you get used to it but is essential to get fast passes on the best rides and a must to book a restaurant the free wifi is useless outside main street this needs to be addressed normal data connection is dodgy at times this also needs to be fixed use the app to your advantage and book fast passes for memory these are minutes apart so we kept reminders on your phone to take advantage of this overall a great day despite the crowd ,4,2017-12-31
5425,Busy and expensive but AWESOME, my husband and i just love disneyland so this review is biased this was the first time we ve been here as a couple for quite a while it s a different experience having an adult trip to disneyland vs with kids we were able to enjoy adult drinks at carthay in dca and downtown disney but that s a different review so our favorite rides in this park are haunted mansion indiana jones and pirates of the caribbean i also really like jingle jungle cruise and small world these all had pretty long lines until late in the evening but the newest feature we enjoyed this trip was maxpass which was new for us and the park has been using for months i think basically you download the disneyland app and pay per person per day to get easy access to fast passes and photos we could get on all our favorite rides at disneyland and dca without the long lines also any disney photographers or ride photos can link the photos to your app we ended up with so many cute great quality photos for that i realize this is an added cost on top of an already expensive park ticket but to us it was totally worth it tip save money where you can bring in food and drinks the only items you cannot bring are alcohol or glass we always had our own bottled water and snacks we ate outside of the park for all meals quick fun monorail ride to downtown disney full of restaurants or eat at your hotel or nearby restaurants bit of advice try to slow down and enjoy the whole park there s so much to see in all the little areas that people miss as the run from ride to ride the train ride around the park is really fun and a good way to save your tired feet btw we walked an average of miles a day during our visit but that did include waking from our hotel and into both parks and downtown disney ,5,2017-12-31
5426,Amazing,for two people that aren t really into rides or had planned to do disney initially this place blew our minds and we hope to return,5,2017-12-28
5427,Love it 6 years later,this was our second visit years later it did not disappoint so much has changed or improved we all did every ride and saw each show we had a few rides temporarily close the max pass is well worth the price as the weekends were crazy and we were not prepared to wait hours for a ride fantastic was fabulous we did the christmas tour which was interesting but i would not recommend it due to the price we can t wait to return for star wars land it is beautiful at christmas ,5,2017-12-28
5428,Amazing experience for the whole family!,we had lots of fun could have been better if there was access to at least one halal food outlet for global muslim travelers as that was the only downside for us the park is beautifully decorated the activities were super fun our next visit would be disneyland hong kong can t wait ,4,2017-12-28
5429,Family of 8 visiting,disneyland is still a wonderful place to visit the midweek visit was slower than most times of the year the wait time for rides were easy for most rides with a fast pass without a pass wait at bobsleds and space mountain was around minute wait mid day the park is still clean safe and a great place to visit the baby strollers are out of control some seem larger than a small car disney should return to renting standard sized strollers we enjoyed the afternoon christmas parade due to the wind we didn t see the fireworks either day ,4,2017-12-27
5430,Christmas Day !,visited on christmas day very few people first visit to this park very disappointed after many trips to orlando disney the size lacks a lot ,3,2017-12-26
5431,A mixture of feeling towards the park,where do i begin on ariving to the park there wasn t alot of explaining where to go or what to do i i would say that there wasn t very much advertising for the events that were happening in the park i think also that the fireworks are far to late we had a two hour drive home so to have to wait around until to see the fireworks then was too late also alot of the rides shut at so you have along period to wait with nothing to do i was also very dissapointed that the characters weren t around to have photos with that is all part of the experience and they weren t there although there were a few things that were dissapointing we still had a good day merry christmas all,3,2017-12-24
5432,A Magical Christmas!!,this is the best time of the year to ho to disneyland incredibly the park isn t nearly as crowded as one might expect costumed characters are out day and night and every inch of the park is decorated it s hard not to feel completely immersed in a thomas kincaid christmas painting if a family was looking to make memories together i cannot imagine a better place to make them everyone who works there will go out of their way to make you feel special ,5,2017-12-23
5433,Our family and friends had a great time.,overall we had a great time this review will focus more on observations and advice the other stuff i think every knows already entrance to the park consists of parking tram to entrance ticket purchase and entry plan on this taking well over an hour likely minutes parking plan on this to take some time like minutes it just takes time you wait to pay them they route you to a parking spot easy and then walk to the tram keep track of which level and location you parked on you will return the same way escalators you came down on this costs for a regular spot or for a premium spot where you may walk less after you park you walk to the tram just outside of the parking structure there is also a security check here tram nice easy ride with little wait tickets the ticket lines are very long arrive early to avoid the lines better is to buy your tickets on line and skip the ticket line i highly recommend getting fast pass so you can go on at least a few rides bypassing long lines your wait for some rides will only be minutes fast pass is limited to only some rides and you have to sign up you can t sign up for several at the same time though if you don t do fast pass then only go during non busy times otherwise you will not enjoy it entrance plan on a line here as well but it moves quickly you will be in within minutes if you leave the park and go to your car it will take you an hour walk to exit get to tram wait for tram tram ride walk to your car food as expected food is very expensive pizza was good but for a while one if you want a sit down meal really expensive then you need to make reservations our visit on a busy day we used fast pass for indiana jones space mountain thunder mountain and buzz light year and the haunted mansion we were able to go on all the big rides and all of the other rides everyone wanted to go on it was extremely busy with walkways full stay for the fireworks it is a fantastic display also the disney parade have fun and buy fast pass ,5,2017-12-23
5434,Our 4th trip from the UK,becoming a bit of a habit spending xmas in california and we can t do so without disneyland great park great rides well catered personally i would recommend a day hopper pass allowing you access both parks throughout your stay all the rides are great fun and most are aimed at and above meaning even the young kids can enjoy the thrilling rides staff are helpful and friendly and you feel safe at all times one thing to be aware of is the parks get crazy busy over the xmas period and especially new year so if you are planning a december trip try and go between the st and the th the new fast pass system using your phone is worth the per day extra per person as it allows you to pre book a fast pass without having to go to the ride itself ,5,2017-12-23
5435,Disney Tips,bag check metal detectors ticket lines can easily take one hour to speed through more quickly you can bypass the bag check if you don t carry any bags at all camera bag counts as a bag pre purchase your ticket to avoid ticket line aaa offers discount per ticket consider arriving at one hour prior to opening we arrived noon on day am on day both times were extremely busy ,5,2017-12-22
5436,An American Institution,i have visited the disney parks in asia many times and i thought that disneyland would be a breeze but boy was i wrong i have never seen so many people in a theme park before it was almost horrifying still we thought the wait times for the rides were still very reasonable best park tips go early we were there at am the gates opened to let people in then you go stand by your land of choice for rope drop use this time to get maxpass on your phone iirc i was able to get my first fp before am there was emh that morning the park is noticeably less crowded in the morning and you can work your way through most of the rides by midday maxpass why aren t you using maxpass forget the snacks cut your shopping budget and get the maxpass i don t even know how i would ever go back to regular fastpass anymore i was able to get fps faster sometimes less than an hour till my window opens again at one point i actually held fps for different rides it was amazing and being able to download all the ride photos was also amazing maxpassssssss everyone has their park strategy but the one that we ve always stuck to is to clear all the rides in one land first to avoid having to double back we also leave our shopping to later we were at the park for days and barely covered the rides we avoided the kiddy ones in strollerland i mean fantasyland i am sad that we missed characters meets why won t jack sparrow stay still we did fantasmic dining at river belle our server was very careful with our dietary requirements halal we opted for vegetarian meals but he informed us that the bbq tofu and the tater tots shared a fryer with the chicken and kindly offered us replacements baked tofu and crudit s when the time for our show came around it was a bit of a walk to our viewing area but we got a spot that offered a very good view we love our disney parks but the crowds were really quite intimidating i think it was because it was the last weekend open to pass holders so they came down in droves i overheard a lady say that she waited hours to find a parking lot we saw the traffic back up along s habor boulevard all headed to the toy story parking lot all morning long honestly worth spending a bit more to stay within walking distance to the park also i bought my tickets on klook they were very much cheaper than buying direct or through the major travel agencies that advertise heavily i received park vouchers in my email that could be used directly for entry to the park ,5,2017-12-22
5437,First time,i believe december would be the best month to go the holiday decorations were so beautiful everything was amazing holiday parade and the princesses best thing i ve ever experienced i would go again during xmas i highly recommend it ,5,2017-12-19
5438,Loved it,if you only get one chance to do it make sure you do it i loved it my yo loves it make sure you get the park hopper pass and spend at least days take advantage of the fast passes and get them early in the day weekdays were better as the weekend got very busy there were plenty of toilets and food outlets there was plenty of access for prams and wheelchairs we went in early december and the christmas theme made it even more special ,5,2017-12-17
5439,Magical,a truly magical place i loved every moment the holiday decorations were beautiful and to see the castle all lit up at night was fantastic the fireworks were great and then the fake snow falling topped the night we enjoyed fantasmic it was a brilliant show ,5,2017-12-16
5440,Coolest place to be... any time any age,arguable the best place in the world to be to experience being a kid again hard to explain but if you ve here or going to come the feeling you get when you re here is in short joy for people who ve grown up with disney s pixar s and star wars cartoon movies you can definitely relate to this magical place very highly recommended happy visiting,5,2017-12-15
5441,Great family fun!,loved it highly recommend front of line tickets we felt it was worth the per person per day through disneyland app as saves lots of time and you get your ride park photo downloads through this for no extra we were there from tue to fri and the volume of people and queue lines increased dramatically towards weekend ,5,2017-12-14
5442,Fantastic Christmas Atmosphere,we really enjoyed the rides and all the usual disney fan fare but the real win was the christmas atmosphere totally enjoyed the parade and entertainment ,4,2017-12-13
5443,Awesome!!!,your never to old for disneyland we went thanksgiving weekend and wore ourself out we were there from am to am hrs it was worth it we were able to get on most of the rides the wait times were about minutes we stayed for the fantasy parade fantasmic light show the fireworks display for closing of the park if you go parking is very expensive food is also expensive for a burger that s just the burger no sides be prepared to do a lot of walking yes it s worth the admission fee ,5,2017-12-12
5444,The Max Pass was great to have,we went to disneyland with a day hopper pass the park was very busy which was expected for this time of year we got in line for star tours and after about minutes a tour guide told us that the ride was experiencing delays and the expected wait time was now doubled we went to indiana jones and waited in line for another minutes and an announcement over a loud speaker told the crowd that the ride was shut down it was also announced that it was not known when the ride would resume we went to get in line for the haunted mansion and the ride was closed we had been at the park for about hours before we actually got on a ride we were having lunch and noticed a pamphlet for the max pass we downloaded the app and the rest of the day went very well with many rides being accessed thanks to the max pass ,4,2017-12-12
5445,Fun for the whole family at Disneyland,after taking out a small loan for tickets i was ready to begrudge my day at disneyland park but the reality couldn t have been more different my family of four including children of years old had a great time we researched ahead of time and went straight to fantasyland experiencing a number of rides with small queues the teacup and dumbo rides led to big smiles from the kids the day was already a success after lots of walking star tours mickey mouse princesses parade coasters and toy story we walked back to the hotel tired but satisfied following a great family day ,5,2017-12-12
5446,So expensive!,obviously it s disneyland so it was great but the price is crazy i hadn t been in some years and was not aware that the price went up so much it s sad that a family almost has to take out a loan to visit i don t think these money hungry ceos is what walt disney had in mind ,4,2017-12-11
5447,Disneyland,park was more crowded than expected for december months but the christmas night lights and holiday parade were a great addition to the trip ,5,2017-12-11
5448,Magical time of year to visit,i ve been going to disneyland since shortly after the park open get to the park early because you can get a lot of rides out before the lines get too long and get the wait times application for disneyland rides use fast pass whenever you can if you want to get a visit at view of the parade or like show you need to get there early i think the best photo apps are the snow white castle when the lights are on and it s a small world ,5,2017-12-10
5449,It really is the happiest place on Earth,we are native southern californians and have been coming to disneyland right from it s beginning over the years there have been many changes over the years but it is still our favorite place to go it is beautiful it is clean and yes it is crowded if you are going to go to disneyland you are going to have to wait in line it is just a fact about disneyland for us a couple of grandparents in our s it is still worth it we love disneyland and we always will bring your patience and just enjoy yourself ,5,2017-12-10
5450,Buy the MaxPass,we are an adult couple on our first trip to disneyland i was overwhelmed by the crowds at first i actually considered leaving within the first hour but the maxpass was awesome and allowed us to whip through both parks within two days we preferred california adventure park over disneyland as it was less crowded with newer attractions and most of our favourite rides were there including guardians and soarin i wouldn t buy the hopper ticket again though once you re inside one park it s too much hassle to switch to the other ,5,2017-12-10
5451,Disneyland Trip,we were celebrating my youngest turning christmas and his upcoming graduation we always come when the weather is wonderful and we love disneyland the lines seemed longer on one of the days but it was worth every penny spent on the trip my son s girlfriend has never been so that was a real experience for her and to see her excitement in every new thing she saw i hope to plan another trip soon thank you ,5,2017-12-09
5452,Better than I’ve ever seen it.,i ve been visiting dl since it opened i ve seen things come and go and watched the quality and care for the customer experience rise and fall many times the new leadership team has a great vision and knows how the execute well this is the best i ve seen the facilities and their priorities on consistent quality customer detail has set a new bar this is remarkable they execute flawlessly even when breakdowns or unexpected things happen bravo disney bravo ,5,2017-12-09
5453,Awesome everywhere,disneyland all over never ceases to amaze we started with the it s small world ride which is christmas theme and then to the rest of the rides we managed to time they uses with the fastpass timing and everything went without a hitch there were new shows like the finding nemo submarine ride and star wars rides we were however disappointed with the cancellation of the night time fireworks but they replaced it with a musical light show of the castle one tip you can take the single rider pass that will let you bypasss all the queues but ride individually and not with any partner ,5,2017-12-09
5454,Holiday,awesome experience had halloween mickey party tickets so that made it even better its always a great place max pass was well worth it with the pics available queues could be an issue but not really a bother food average in some places but not a worry ,5,2017-12-08
5455,Disney family we love it,second visit from down under to the happiest place on earth it doesn t disappoint still awesome and totally recommend,5,2017-12-08
5456,2nd time here,i was here before with my family when i was months so this is my first time back obviously crowded but it was easy to navigate and get on rides especially when the parades were happening the fireworks show was amazing the rides were a bit lack luster but still good ,4,2017-12-08
5457,A classic,still the standard when it come to theme parks even when it is crowded as it was this trip due to nice weather it still manages to exceed expectations all done up for the holidays this is a magical time to visit the park the christmas trees and decorations are everywhere and add a great ambiance disappointed there was no jingle boat cruise this year but what they do to the haunted mansion and small world really get you in the holiday spirit renovations going on for the new star wars land did not infringe on any other areas of the park will always be a classic theme parks experience ,5,2017-12-06
5458,The Magical Magic Kingdom,disneyland is a wonderful place to go if you don t mind huge crowds and long lines best times to go are during the school year midweek it is expensive but a total entertainment experience ,5,2017-12-05
5459,First time to Disneyland,had a great time but two day hopper past was plenty didn t really find disney employees very friendly in one store i was ready to get checked in stood there finally someone turned around and said do you need engraving done i said no and she just left me there standing was disappointed in the christmas decorations as well not what i expected ,3,2017-12-05
5460,Grand Californian amazing- Disneyland disappointed,my mother sister and i decided to take my month old daughter to disneyland she is a walking and very interested in everything we were there from november and stayed at the grand california and visited both disney parks grand california this is by far the best hotel at disneyland we have stayed at all disney resorts and this really is the best and you will pay for it too it is very close the the park and our room had a view of downtown disney downtown disney was decorated for christmas and had christmas music playing until the early morning hours but the room was surprisingly sound proof the staff and experience at the hotel were both perfect the pools were great one had a slide and the pool staff was also very attentive and helpful i honestly don t think i can go back to disneyland without staying there now to the parks disneyland has gone downhill the last time i was there was in three years ago and it was much better then the customer service in the parks was non existent it seemed like they were all just trying to survive and get as many people in and out as possible it s like they forget that disneyland is an expensive trip for people we flew in and also that it s a special trip for people especially if it s a first trip it was my daughters first trip and i m happy she is young enough o forget it the rides were ok but lines were long month old loved dumbo but the line for pete pan was too long for her to wait in minutes to an hour she also loved running around goofy s playground at toon town minnie mouse breakfast this was the most disappointing part of our trip my month old daughter loves minnie and mickey and knows who they are so i though ok we should do minnie mouse breakfast at the plaza inn we had reservations at am on a thursday and after showing our reservations we waited in a line to meet minnie well that s what i thought but it was actually just a line to stand next to minnie for a picture i did not know this and thought my daughter could touch minnie and give her a hug but this was not allowed and minnie was extremely rude her handlers were rude and the photographer was rude obviously my month old doesn t know why everyone is yelling at her to not touch minnie mouse and i didn t know why we were being yelled at because i thought meeting minnie meant you got a hug anyway i was so upset that i was crying at the cashier they make you pay before you go in the food was decent and it is a buffet so paying a person is expected what really got me was that they tried to get me to buy that horrific picture of me my daughter and mean minnie mouse seriously why would i want to pay for a picture to remember such a horrible experience it was disappointing but i think older kids will like it as they can understand why people are yelling at them anyway the week before thanksgiving was crowded but it s disneyland so i expected that my month old had a great time she loved all of it except the minnie mouse breakfast also john wayne airport is the best not crowded and easy with a stroller baby gear the customer service was better at the airport than disneyland highly recommend this airport if you are flying in for disneyland ,3,2017-11-29
5461,Disneyland is as Good As It Gets,disneyland is a place to visit that is as good as it gets i told my husband that we can learn a lesson from humanity by going to disneyland you wait in long lines walk through crowds wait a long time to get food and drinks during busy periods you tote children around of all ages and you do it with patience and a smile because you re at disneyland and nothing bad happens at disneyland i saw people with screaming babies and they handled it in stride at the end of the day dads and moms alike were carrying toddlers through the park waiting for their bus ride back to the hotel exhausted beyond words but they smiled and waited patiently they could have been grumpy but they were not after all we had just spent the day at the magic kingdom maybe this isn t a review but more of a tribute to my fellow disneyland goers on the virtue of patience humility graciousness and peace thank you all for a wonderful vacation and thank you to disneyland for creating a place that allows this to happen so freely ,5,2017-11-27
5462,"It's Disney. It's expensive, gets super crowded mid-day, but it's still a wonderful magical place.",i want to give it stars but just can t this place is magical this place has some great rides it makes you feel like a kid but it s just to get in i also highly recommend going very early as in when the gates open this park gets very crowded mid day and the lines could get a big out of control use your fast passes wisely because they could literally save you hours even though it is expensive i still really enjoyed my visit ,4,2017-11-26
5463,Disneyland - Not Always the Happiest Place,i took my two grown sons to disneyland on monday that morning it took us over minutes just to get through security and another minutes to actually get into the park then we spent at least of the next hours waiting in lines even the fast pass lines were longer than usual i think we were able to get on three rides in that time it turned out they underestimated the amount of people going into the park that day by at least or more so it was wall to wall people it was very frustrating and exhausting we took an afternoon break at our hotel and went back to the park after dark which was a much better experience can t say i d go back to disneyland any time soon unless i limit my visit to the latter part of the day ,3,2017-11-23
5464,Finally Figured Out How to Do This Park,i think this is the fourth time i ve been here we are locals so our daughter always asks to go the key is to go to bed early the night before and if you can stay at a disney resort hotel they let you in an hour earlier than everyone else every other day it goes back and forth between the two parks even though that s still thousands of people there really are that many hotel rooms on property and in the vicinity it gets you a great jump on the most popular rides with perhaps only minute wait time as opposed to minutes at peak times then the key is to work the fast passes always make sure you have a fast pass in play so what you end up doing is waiting in a long standby line for a ride while also waiting for your fastpass for another ride to become active then you can hop over to the fastpass ride and only wait for a few minutes as soon as your fastpass becomes active for the ride you got it for get another fastpass basically it means you can get two rides in every minutes or so as opposed to just one if you ve been there since am when the park opens an hour earlier for hotel guests you re probably wiped by eleven so go take a break back at your hotel for a couple of hours then return later in the afternoon for more madness just remember to get another fast pass before you leave so you have a ride with a short wait to come back to ,4,2017-11-23
5465,Where dreams are made,great place we went over days it s makes a huge difference which dates you choose in terms of how busy the park is great fun had by all,4,2017-11-22
5466,Fun but getting CROWDED!,for the first time in years this disneyland trip was different don t get me wrong we had a blast and thoroughly enjoyed our visit but unfortunately the park is getting outgrown by its visitors we went during the work week weekday figuring the crowds would be low enough to enjoy everything unfortunately between the hours of am pm it s insane monday wednesday it wasn t too bad but thursday it was ridiculous with the amount of people minute wait for pirates craziness we did exit the park early to enjoy a swim at the hotel and then returned in the evening but even then it was getting crazy busy of course we will always come back to disneyland but i think after this trip we will rethink going at a different time we went the third week of october also the disneyland app stinks inaccurate information heats up phone real fast and just isn t the best for getting info try mouse wait also if you happen to go during the halloween time try to visit during a ticketed evening event as the crowds during the daytime are minimal ,4,2017-11-22
5467,"Worth it,truly",if you have children who are young enough to be true believers there are few things more truly magical than seeing your child see their favourite character for the first time in the flesh we were lucky that the photographers captured the looks on our children s faces at that moment and those photos make the whole trip worth it it is hot in this park in warm weather hardly surprising with all the concrete and bitumen reflecting and retaining the heat my best advice would be to plan your day around the heat and have really good hats heat stroke will kill the magic water filter bottles are great carry them in empty light less of a security delay and fill them when you get in little ones will dehydrate quickly so have a plan enjoy it and roll with what means most to your kids and enjoy the magic reflected in their faces their memories might fade but yours will last forever ,5,2017-11-21
5468,Magical! Really!,we got there in time for rope drop first time ever that early but so worth it it is exciting and get in position for which side you want to enter first i also highly recommend paying the extra per person and buy the max pass link your tickets online with the disney app and then buy the maxpass through the app too you can get max pass s like a fast pass but you don t have to walk to get the tickets or have everybody s tickets and less paper to lose every hour or so we had a system to get the ticket scheduled arrive at the beginning of the return time and when redeemed and in the max pass line get the next one by the time we went on the ride and walked to the next one it was max pass ready again for the first time ever we did every single ride the parade and fireworks and favorite rides twice in one day most enjoyable day ever started with star tours buzz lightyear and matterhorn without maxpass since we were early also use the photographers in the park much better pictures open the app and get the scan code and show the photographers and all the pictures they take are free and you can t download them from your phone disney has made it more affordable and enjoyable the fireworks have snowlike bubbles after that really made it wonderful so fun to see my child s face in awe mine too also stop at the holiday bakery near the round in front of the castle order a christmas raspberry macaroon early in the day because you will want another later nowhere else in either park sells them they were divine thanks for an amazing time disney ,5,2017-11-20
5469,I don't know about the happiest place on earth! Many parents were seen with crying kids......,it is a great place and even as an adult loved the place would request disneyland to be more specific about how to enter the place when you have a voucher from your travel agent in australia we took our voucher on our mobile device to the ticket counter to be told we had to have a printed ticket we spent the next hours finding a place to print it out and oh the person on the voucher must have id to use the voucher never was there any mention of this on the tickets we also had a voucher for universal studios and they clearly stated all of this on the voucher disneyland please give better instructions ,5,2017-11-20
5470,Disney Trip,it s fun place for all ages a bit busy but can t meet the shared memories with the family do not bring selfie stick it will taken at taken by security for safety reason lesson learned bring sunglasses hat and nice camera i used my cell phone but pictures did not turn out well best day i feel is monday tuesday and wednesday come prepared by taking breakfast and take the rides when everyone is going for lunch it s a small world ride is best if you want to relax christmas lights are amazing especially at night ,4,2017-11-20
5471,"Fun, Fun, Fun!",this is it a main attraction and you cannot go wrong on having fun here space mountain indiana jones it s a small world after all when you visit disneyland get ready to open up your pocket book as there are plenty of goodies here for purchase ,5,2017-11-20
5472,The happiest place on earth.,what can i say other then i was like a kid in a candy store i had dreamed of this place all my life and i will go back again for star wars world in ,5,2017-11-19
5473,Love Disneyland!,had a great time with the grandchildren the people who work there are all so nice and professional i have no idea how they do it yes it was crowded but they have lots of entertainment while you wait good restaurants they really work to get you in a ride as soon as possible but not make you feel rushed the attractions have been updated ,5,2017-11-19
5474,You just have to go.,my daughter and i were revisiting the usa and disneyland after a twenty year absence disneyland is still a compelling place to visit but not without its disappointments here they are the queues dreadful you must learn to use the fast pass system or you will die of old age waiting in line crowds very bad crushes unless you avoid all holidays and avoid weekends and even then it can be very bad strollers seems like anyone with a child brings or hires a big stroller and uses it to carry the vast amounts of food and drinks they bring into the park to avoid disney s exorbitant prices and they park the damned things everywhere including directly in front of benches so tired people cannot sit down mobility scooters see comments for strollers plus the vast number of them are not being used by genuinely disabled people but by unfit and or oversized people too lazy to use their legs like a sucker as homer would say disney should ban their use by anyone not able to produce a medical certificate from a doctor that may help to alleviate the problems these things cause like the rest of us being run down by speeding scooters they block pedestrian access slow down queues and take up large areas of real estate being parked everywhere please note that for genuinely disabled people of course they should be allowed but almost all the current users are not disabled and disney should tighten this up food and drink mostly just average quality stomach fillers and highly expensive try and bring your own the quality of the souvenirs has decreased a lot in twenty years our twenty year old indiana jones hats are still in good condition by comparison the ones on offer now are rubbish this sort of comparison applies to just about all the souvenirs dumbing down christmas i hate the replacing of merry christmas with happy holiday christmas is about christ s birthday deal with it maintenance try not to just go for one day because that ride you were so desperate to experience may be closed for the day for maintenance at least a three day pass means you should get to go on it one day maintenance work seems to happen more on week days security do not bring a selfie stick the guards will confiscate it as being potentially dangerous pretty silly really because once in the park you can buy heavy metal souvenirs like candle sticks to batter someone or robust plastic swords to put out an offending eye but we did feel very safe look i ve rabbited on with a long list of gripes but i still am giving disneyland four stars because it is worth the visit at least once for non usa visitors i believe lots of americans get annual passes and visit many times during the year i met some they seemed nice but somewhat obsessed sort of like benign extras in a handmaiden s tale you may love it to bits and come back every week but two visits in twenty years was enough for me in the interest of fair mindedness my daughter disagrees with me and would live here if she could afford the cost of the disneyland hotels kim w australia,4,2017-11-17
5475,Great for children and families,disneyland was just a short walk from our hotel peacock suites in anaheim we spent just one full day at the park this park not unsurprisingly is geared towards children and not adult travellers like ourselves we much preferred universal studios some of the highlights were travelling in a submarine and the the excellent disney parade we were disappointed that there were few characters roaming the park we expected a lot more characters in costume whilst we visited on a quiet day but most of the sit down restaurants still had long queues a quiet day is still very busy in disneyland i would probably never return unless it was with grandchildren ,3,2017-11-17
5476,Magical,well what can one say about disneyland it is truly magical just seeing the faces on all the young kids is so enlightening the staff are helpful and knowledgeable and they make you feel like one of the family the simulation rides were the best for my son and i star wars was awesome you gotta try that one very busy but i guess it depends when you go we went on a saturday and it was sunny which is lovely and there were many families out and about for some people it is a once in a lifetime experience and some people have gone multiple times lucky them i think every child deserves a chance to visit disneyland ,5,2017-11-16
5477,Always amazing- get the Maxpass!,if you get a chance upgrade to the maxpass option it s about a day gives you free photopass pictures and best of all allows you to schedule your fastpasses via a mobile app rather than running around the park to find ticket machines saved us a ton of time and we got to go on a lot of rides painlessly also check out perks if you are a disney chase visa holder they often have character meet and greets with little to no wait look for characters roaming the parks randomly you can usually get a quick pic as they walk around,5,2017-11-15
5478,Too busy for us,we hadn t planned on visiting here in la as we had visiting disneyland in paris a couple of years ago but we had a change of plans so thought why not it was pretty much the same as paris only a lot bigger but also a lot busier it was a very hot day and we did a few rides but trying to find a seat for lunch was manic too much for us we are in our early s ,4,2017-11-14
5479,Florida is vastly superior,visited the park on veterans day massive queue of traffic just to get to the parking ticket booth fortunately i had already bought the park entry tickets as the line to buy was also long the park must have been at capacity as there was really only space to stand for each person even with fast passes and arriving early in the morning we managed to get only a small number of rides minute wait to ride on its a small world was unbelievable i do not recommend wasting your valuable time and effort coming to this park if you wish to see disney go to magic kingdom on the east coast for me this was not a good experience which was quite surprising ,1,2017-11-13
5480,"Waiting, waiting, waiting",disneyland is beautiful disneyland is expensive disneyland means waiting in lines long long lines i expected to see the characters everywhere instead long lines of people wait just to get a picture there were really long lines for food i dont know how celiacs survive in the us unless you eat steak everywhere you go the token gf meal listed is usually unavailable and if you have any food allergies bring a picnic i would buy the front of line pass if i ever get back to la the teacup ride was a bucket list item and i loved it the submarine ride and startours rides were great ,3,2017-11-12
5481,36yrs later the magic continues!,it has been yrs since i visited disneyland with my parents but the or so hours i spent there yesterday highlighted the magic of the place true the castle may have appeared to have shrunk in size but only because the rest of it has become larger than life where on earth could you go the the haunted mansion which has remained physically the same but now with a brilliant christmas theme meet darthvader go on a star wars simulator and fall down a rabbit hole with alice the christmas pageant was sublime and the fireworks set to christmas music brought tears to my eyes bravo ,5,2017-11-12
5482,Loved it!!,i hadn t been to this park since so i wasn t sure what to expect but i loved it different rides brought back so many memories we really love that the rides were so close in proximity it is truly a place of fun and imagination ,5,2017-11-11
5483,Magic for All Ages,my daughter and i visited disneyland this week it is a magical place no matter what age you are i found myself enjoying the rides as much as she did the fast pass for the haunted house ride is located in the graveyard in the new orleans section of the park we returned during our fast pass window and scanned our park tickets to enter the shorter line we were on the ride in about minutes this is an efficient way to get on a popular ride the food was pricy and my biggest surprise was that so many people would be at disneyland on a value priced day it might as well have been the peak of summer we took the train to go from area to area reducing some of the walk time the tunnel between futureworld and the front of the park was great we also enjoyed the submarine ride pirate island autopia and toon town we love disneyland and will keep coming back for years to come if you haven t been what are you waiting for ,4,2017-11-10
5484,Small but nice,we went to disneyland midweek in november the park is not nearly as big as disney world but it s just as nice one thing that disney really needs to work on is not letting people cut in the lines every ride we rode people would come thru the line at some point catch up to their family this is called cutting disney needs to put a stop to this some of the line queues are pretty narrow and there is no place to go to allow these people thru but they still try it if you are one of these people please wait for your entire group and then get in line at the same time we used the max pass and it worked great we would use one fast pass and then while we were in line we would figure out where we were going next and get a fast pass for a little bit later if we had time we would ride other rides and then use our fast pass it worked out great i know per person is a lot but you also get all your pictures ,4,2017-11-09
5485,Magical experience,i had no expectations of trip to disneyland being anything too special but boy was i pleasantly surprised i rarely use the word magical but here it would be appropriate we visited both parks and i can t find anything to complain from the whole long day everything just worked and all the details were ironed out and implemented in wonderful and perfect way everything looked gorgeous and the sound of the park was awesome we even visited it during sunday and there was some kind of special event and there were lots of people but still we did not feel crowded at any time the food was cheaper than we expected and it was really good we even got gluten free choice in every place just needed to ask we did not queue more than minutes to any attraction thanks to the fastpass system that we could even just use from the mobile app and did not need to walk to the attractions to get the fastpasses the attractions had such wonders that i have not seen in any other park that i have visited you should really visit at least star tours toy story midway mania and soarin around the world we did not get to visit everything but we also loved california screamin nothing too special but just good old rollercoaster experience and the parade you should really go see it we did not even know that they had that everyday just happened to be there when it started the music the talent and the characters everything was just so perfect and all the people watching the parade were so happy that it brought a tear to my eye remembering all these characters from my childhood that i had not paid attention to too much recently my girlfriend also really liked the different characters that were wondering around the parks we had to queue for some of them for minutes but it was worth it for her i really liked the patrolling stormtroopers that were really in character and the goofy and pluto and everyone there thanks for the wonderful performances to everyone the price is of course high dollars for the two parks per person for one day but here you get your moneys worth with the park being open hours and everything being so perfectly designed i would go again and maybe even take a longer stay it was a long way from finland to visit this place ,5,2017-11-09
5486,Excellent!,we stayed at disneyland from when it opened until about an hour before it closed and were annoyed at ourselves that we did not have more time to continue exploring this magical park we found the wait times to be very reasonable the cost of food and drink were very good a lot better than what you would pay in australia at a theme park cannot wait to go back ,5,2017-11-08
5487,Disneyland castle- not a castle,disneyland castle is very underwhelming and a disappointing attempt at magic it is tiny and not what i d pictured at all there were about rides appropriate for adults and we rode them until we knew every corner and bump good fun but next time i ll go to six flags sorry mickey ,3,2017-11-08
5488,"Great park, crazy crowds",went to disney for halloween loved the decorations rides and the characters be prepared to walk lots and were comfortable clothes and bring a sweater at night the food was crazy expensive we did find a pasta place that was ok for dinner loved the parade at night and all the shops ,4,2017-11-07
5489,Holiday,how can you not love disneyland great for families extremely clean great rides plenty of food options this has been the year i have been coming to parks,5,2017-11-06
5490,Everyone has to grow up sometime,i ve visited walt disney world twice prior once when i was then again when i was and for the third time now in my thirties as such it didn t have the same impact on me as it did when i was young but that is to be expected i hadn t been to the california park before both prior times were to the florida park this time it felt a lot smaller and more squashed than its southern sister the main pro to this visit was that i got to experience the park as an adult rather than a child and the things i loved and remembered before had completely changed especially the horror of the queues for the rides when you are young you don t pay attention to these things the rides themselves didn t disappoint splash mountain space mountain big thunder mountain were all fantastic and after being too scared to ride on space mountain as a child was wonderful to finally experience it the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean were fun but not as exciting as they were to my younger eyes for children families couples etc this is the perfect attraction and i recommend making this a priority if visiting california but for me i much preferred universal studios for having more aimed at adults all in all this was a fun and great way to spend a sunny day aside from the horror of our return coach not coming back for my friend and i and thus after a few hours in the mcdonalds car park with one phone between us managing to find an uber to take us back to hollywood it was a pretty enjoyable day with no rugrats regrets apart from of course paying for a shuttle bus that didn t return if like myself you are visiting with friends you ll have a good time but may find disney california adventure to have more to offer it s still worth the visit and was great to see the original park and experience some of the fond memories i had from being a child my eight year old self thought this was the most magical place on earth and while i no longer share that opinion it still is for the most part magical ,4,2017-11-06
5491,Halloween at Disneyland. It had been 19 years since I've been to Disneyland. This time it was without the kids. We met,it had been years since i ve been to disneyland this time it was without the kids we met our good friends for an adult only weekend there was great things to do plenty of rides shows and good food i would definitely recommend getting the hopper pass since both parks are just steps from each other and you can toggle at your leasure they now serve beer wine also but more difficult to find ,5,2017-11-06
5492,Enjoy Friday the 13th at Disneyland Park.,decorations at the park were outstanding being able to ride all the attractions seemed to be very easy cast members were very helpful in making our trip enough to remember ,5,2017-11-05
5493,It really is the Happiest Place on Earth,had a great time every staff member was extremely helpful and we all had a great time on all the rides ,5,2017-11-05
5494,Disneyland Halloween,first trip to the halloween dressed up disneyland and i m a massive nightmare before christmas fan so of course i was excited as a native californian i ve been to disneyland more times than five people could count but it was the first time i d seen the updated pirates of the caribbean ride no no what have they done the movie was made based on the ride i grew up with altering it to fit the movie complete with several animatronic johnny depps as jack sparrow and new recordings where the pirates talk about getting jack sparrow did me in and ruined a childhood treasure again the movie was based on the ride it doesn t mean the ride needed changing don t ruin a great thing disneyland create new rides but leave the classics for those of us who love them to share with new generations to come photos the haunted mansion all decked out for halloween and nightmare before christmas,4,2017-11-03
5495,Not Worth Second Time,took grand children they enjoyed it but we did not food was bad it is expensive for second time with no novelty use single rider and express pass to save time in case you are using uber one can store baby seats at stroller rental without any charges download application we did jones adventure splash mountain thunder mountains besides kids rides carry food water and food ,3,2017-11-03
5496,Halloween time at Disneyland,we have travelled from australia and have a ten day park hopper pass we just had our fourth day in the park i am travelling alone with my four year old daughter we went to the halloween party which was good as the lines were quite small so we managed to ride a fair few rides we also got a good spot for the parade due to the smaller crowds today we met the disney princesses which my daughter lover more than the rides i highly recommend the max pass purely for the photos i ended up with about photos today all for we ve had a great time overall ,4,2017-11-03
5497,The large crowds and long waits will test your patience!,i took my year daughter and four of her friends to disneyland to celebrate her birthday a recent saturday in october we purchased the fast pass for an extra per ticket and that was a total waste of money you cannot fast pass multiple rides at a time only one at a time and until your scheduled ride is past the day we went the wait time was an average of minutes on all the popular attractions bring comfortable shoes for long standing times the haunted mansion was hours wait the food is quite expensive it s best to bring in your own meal or snacks bring your fully charged cellphone and portable chargers there s no place to plug a charger too overall disneyland is an expensive so be prepared to spend a lot of ,3,2017-11-02
5498,"Expensive, over rated",i think this place has expired its use by date no longer value for money over crowded no rest areas under shade by rides lunch family of got a fried shrivelled burger and chips and one drink no longer has fireworks every night or electric parade pay more see less from nz th and last time visit,2,2017-11-02
5499,Love Disneyland...was more excited than most of the kids!,i love disneyland it is an amazing place and i prefer disneyland park over the california park just because it s classic and true disney the maxpass app is the best invention ever it s per day and it allows you to get fastpasses without having to walk to the ride to get it disney world in florida needs to do something like this instead of allowing fastpasses up to days prior to a visit that s wrong but anyway disneyland is great because it still has classic rides like mr toad and snow white s scary adventures but has modernized it some with star tours and the haunted mansion holiday and the indiana jones ride love indy i just really hope that star wars does not take over disneyland like it has in florida at disney world i visited in mid october and it was crazy crowded holy cow was it crowded but this is where maxpass saved me there were halloween parties on select nights and those days the parks were busier because they let the party goers in some hours before the party which i think is wrong but with maxpass even with crazy crowds i was still able to do the most popular fast pass rides x or more in a day the haunted mansion is my favorite ride and the haunted mansion holiday does not disappoint if you ve seen tim burton s a nightmare before christmas you really need to see the haunted mansion decked out paying tribute to the movie all the classics except for big thunder mountain railroad were open when i was there and when i got home thunder mountain reopened disneyland is always a great time but it can definitely be overwhelming when the crowds are so massive and the temps near degrees thankfully the splash mountain ride has been redone so everyone gets wet now and i don t mean just wet i mean drenched it was awesome ,5,2017-11-01
5500,"Awesome, of course",we love disneyland it is so awesome we really loved the maxpass for per person per day you need the disney app it is so convenient and includes a photo pass totally awesome to be able to have your picture take everywhere ,5,2017-10-31
5501,Amazing getaway for bachelorette trip,went during spring break this past year and what a blast i m in my mid twenties but still a kid at heart and this was such a fun and totally nostalgic experience i went with friends for days yes some of the lines were long but if you have good company it will always be the best time cannot wait to go back ,5,2017-10-31
5502,Always great to go,it s always great to go i like to go with my little kids because the little rides and the characters mean more to them teenagers seem to be more bored with the rides at disneyland because they want more thrilling rides it s good to see so many activities and things to do and so many improvements on old rides ,5,2017-10-30
5503,Always The most magical place on earth.,family loved the halloween decorations staff was amazing as always weather was degrees vendors made sure we had ice water free although the food drinks and souvenirs were expensive not any more then in past years max pass was very helpful and i loved all the pictures taken by photographers professional photos downloaded for free hrs worth the money would have liked to see more characters but it was hot so i understand mon thu off season best time to go wait times for rides about hour waits but with fast pass min waits sometimes walked right on the disney app was super helpful and i loved the ease of use ,5,2017-10-30
5504,Awesome fun,i first visited here as a year old loved it still loads of fun excitement entertainment and rides my only disappointment was that for a happy place very few of the staff seemed to be happy they were providing service but not to the disney level and it was like visiting a supermarket level of service ,4,2017-10-27
5505,Seriously in Need of Overhaul!,so i chose to go to disneyland during october because i thought it would be fun to have a halloween experience at disney that was not the case other than minor decor changes it was same ol same ol and a big disappointment for me and my guest who really really needed a fun vacation even so i love disneyland but being that i have a million other places i d like to go before i leave this earth and this was to be my last trip to the happiest place on earth i wouldn t have minded a bit more enthusiasm for halloween another thing i found lacking was the regard for persons who are handicapped my guest had a permanent handicap status yet there were no accommodations for someone who cannot stand in line years ago that wasn t the case if you were handicapped you were able to enter a ride via the exit to that ride and your wait was minimal shame on you disneyland with more and more baby boomers reaching an age where they can no longer keep up with the youngsters of today you should be more compassionate get rid of the fast pass quit worrying about making an extra buck my god you already charge an outrageous fee to enter the park and pretend it s your grandmother standing in line ,3,2017-10-27
5506,Magical...if you do a little planning,this was our second trip to disneyland we like the land better than the world because there is less planning involved but make no mistake you still need to plan first make sure to know park hours early entry days and fireworks they are not daily like they are at disney world second and probably most important get the early be there at least minutes before gates open disneyland tends to get busier as the day goes on so if you want to skip the waits the only way to do so is to get up early also i recommend max pass it is per ticket and well worth it to be able to make fastpasses on your phone the first morning we arrived a saturday between extra magic hour and max pass we had ridden rides by our pm late lunch when we returned after a park break waits were ridiculous but we still got to ride thanks to max pass the halloween decorations were awesome we loved the halloween overlays to haunted mansion and space mountain my only complaint aside from late afternoon evening crowds is that there were no nighttime parades to enjoy while we were there food is expectedly expensive but we managed to only eat one meal a day inside the park to keep the cost down we had a fabulous time and look forward to coming back again in the future ,5,2017-10-27
5507,What a wonderful experience!,our children will treasure this forever bibbidi bobbidi boutique was magical for my daughter it is expensive but a dream come true for little girls wanting to be treated like a princess jedi knight training was awesome for my son really well organised just make sure you put your son daughter s name down to participate at the start of the day as it books out quickly i strongly recommend the fast pass you get this after you have your tickets you upgrade your ticket on your phone using the disney app ,4,2017-10-26
5508,Amazing first time!,after visiting walt disney world several times we finally made our dreams come true by visiting the original magic kingdom what can i say it was amazing it was so cool to be able to walk from the hotel to the parks the cm s really make things magical for everyone yes it s crowded pretty much every day but they do a really great job of crowd control also the parks are amazingly beautiful and kept very clean ,5,2017-10-25
5509,Disneyland!!!!,its disneyland where dreams are made of long lines happiness kids heat we came october and during a record breaking heatwave lots of walking rides churros corn dogs and more ,5,2017-10-24
5510,Disneyland! Really magical!,it s not our first disney experience but it s the first for us to visit the original disneyland crowds were crazy the park was full but the experience was still amazing ,5,2017-10-24
5511,"Well, not great",i have been to disney parks orlando paris anaheim many times and this truly was the worst experience yet we purchased park hopper tickets while in the park one show was cancelled five minutes before it was supposed to start we waited in line for minutes rides were closed due to technical difficulties the food was partially disappointing and disney advertised halloween themed decorations there wasn t much of that i was very disappointed since i love halloween and expected disney to go all out the europapark in rust germany does a way better job and halloween doesn t have a real tradition in germany we wrote a letter of complaint to disney s customer service but never heard back in our experience was better for the th anniversary but i don t think we will be back to the park anytime soon ,2,2017-10-22
5512,Halloween decor,we ve come so many times through the years we can t count them for a time we used to come every year and sometimes twice when our kids were young not a low expense trip as we travel from northern california translation not eligible for southern california seasons tickets now a days we come maybe every couple of years we never came during the halloween season and we just love the christmas season decorations so we thought we would try it out we were not impressed yes there were some building decor and slight changes in the rides but not much else major shows were only on the weekends which we did not see as we came mid week park was closed early for the special event party and the lines were as bad as in mid summer definitely not worth taking time off and coming down for the seasonal change southern california folks are so lucky ,3,2017-10-22
5513,Happiest Place On Earth!,i have been to this park numerous times over the years and although the rides still remain roughly the same the improvement to things like their app are amazing we used the disneyland app through out our three days as we bought the fast pass ticket and the photo ticket both are definitely worth the extra money the fast pass tickets were great it got us past some huge lines on some of the major rides only downfall was that later in the evening the passes didn t seem to be available anymore the photo package is also well worth the money this meant we could have our picture taken anywhere around the park and we could download it straight away from free i absolutely love coming to disneyland and will be back again asap ,5,2017-10-22
5514,Happiest place on earth,always clean helpful staff and literally happiest place on earth yes food and souvenirs are pricey but its disney you have to expect that my only qualm was paying excdessive amounts for character breakfast for then being encouraged to purchase the photo as well i think the photo could be included in the price i would upgrade to maxpass we didnt only got photopass and utilise fast passes where you can if youre silly enough to ride splash mountain as soon as the park opens and dont mind being a bit wet early on you may get several repetitive rides like we did ,5,2017-10-22
5515,Fun memories,we are avid disney world fans but it was nice to see a different take on things the smaller setting was a nice change of pace best part was how close everything is in proximity to everything else wish the fast pass system was the same as disney world ,4,2017-10-22
5516,Brings out the kid in you,one day is not enough we could have day at the adventure park and another day in the themed park soarin around the world ride was totally awesome ,5,2017-10-22
5517,Just amazing!!,such a wonderful place to visit and experience everything on offer three days of full on fun bring your walking shoes and stamina to make the most of every second we flew hours from rarotonga to visit anaheim and disneyland and we have had a fabulous time disneyland is so very well organised clean and so efficiently run food is available everywhere and restrooms easy to find all around the park thank you to all of the staff everywhere in the park as without exception you are all energetic professional and top of your game the attention to detail in the entire park is astounding everywhere you turn is in theme and just amazing we had an awesome three days and take with us cool memories of an exceptional place thank you ,5,2017-10-22

5520,Excellent as always,all good except they confiscated my selfie stick loved cars land revamp of soarin also good disneyland park was hosting a halloween event which made the park very busy ,5,2017-10-21
5521,Mickey Mouse,absolutely loved it the experience is what you would have dreamt of all of your life the rides were great the characters in the park were fantastic all of the other facilities including food and beverages second to none,5,2017-10-19
5522,A must in California!,everyone should go at least once in their life buy your tickets in advance to avoid the lines ride all the popular rides but don t skip the original rides in fantasyland like snow white pinocchio mr toads etc they are charming and fun and rarely more than a min wait most restaurant portions are huge so i highly recommend sharing ,5,2017-10-18
5523,Absolutely unbelievable,we had insufficent time to really see this wonderful place to its fullest as only had one day hopefully we will get an opportunity to get back sometime ,5,2017-10-18
5524,Still the happiest place on earth!!’,disneyland in anaheim california built by walt disney himself is still the happiest place on earth yeah yeah yeah ,5,2017-10-18
5525,Disneyland at Halloween!,the disney mickey s halloween haunt private party is the best value for disneyland limited tickets sold short lines for the rides lots of candy and disney halloween fun new this year for one price you have park hopper access to both disneyland park and california adventure it s a private party with limited tickets sold so the lines for the rides are all much shorter that on the average day kids and adults can wear costumes disney friendly the private party starts at pm midnight but you can enter the park at pm and i suggest you do to maximize your time parking is no longer included with the event ticket purchase and the parking is an additional per car tickets sell out quickly so if you want to get a friday or a specific date such as halloween mark your calendar for july and begin checking the mickey s halloween haunt site for sale dates the security was increased this year with both a bag search and metal detector once you exit the parking structure and before the tram the added security made me feel more comfortable with the grandkids disneyland really goes all out with the halloween decorations throughout the park from the moment you get off the tram and it really comes to life after dark with dancing skeletons music halloween decorated rides trick or treat stations a halloween themed parade and firework spectacular the trick or treat stations are located throughout the park the ones near the haunted mansion have the longest lines the ones near fantasyland have the shortest lines all give out the same types of candies you can fill a bag quickly the kids love this we arrived at pm and didn t leave until am the shops on main street stay open later than the rides to capture the on the way out of the park souvenir purchases overall the experience rates a star however the long long wait for the tram after the park closes to get back to the parking structure is really awful i strongly suggest that disneyland improve this next year by operating at least double the trams after pm it took approximately minutes for our family of to get on a tram the lines are long and not well defined adults and kids are very tired and people push and shove as the wait becomes longer and the temperature dips it really puts a damper on the evening ,5,2017-10-17
5526,Last Day,we were lucky enough to get complimentary passes and only pay the for two fast passes via disneyland app the weather was quite warm monday the th of october but that didn t stop us from having a blast disneyland is covered in halloween decor favorite rides teacups of course space mountain bobsled i am as excited as everyone else for the newest ride to open up soon ,5,2017-10-17
5527,Dreams do come true,we have just arrived back in australia after a week vacation in anaheim we spent days at disneyland going between the two parks and downtown disney we travelled as a party of ten with kids ranging from years in total the whole experience was wonderful the staff across the both parks were professional friendly and ensured everything ran smoothly the entertainment shows and parades were absolutely brilliant facilities across the park were always kept clean and well stocked when they say it s the happiest place on earth well we certain felt that thank you to the beautiful american people for welcoming us into your parks and treating us so well we loved it all ,5,2017-10-17
5528,most amazing place EVER,i cannot recommend disneyland enough you don t know how amazing and how magical it is until you ve been the fireworks and parades were stunning the rides were so much fun with short queues even in august and the general atmosphere was just so happy i am a huge disney fan and this was my first time to the california park and it was equally as amazing as orlando and paris get fastpasses asap for cars and guardians of the galaxy at the california adventure park as they re by far the most popular rides ,5,2017-10-15
5529,Magical experience,i have been to disneyland paris times but it was nothing compared to this a must see when you come to visit california one bad point ticket are way more expensive compared to paris,4,2017-10-15
5530,Discouranging,we had not been to disneyland in a few years so we were overdue to check back in and see what has changed there was not a lot of new rides from the last time we were here but this place was packed we had a long day but figured the park would be cleared out around p m and we could enjoy the park from midnight but the park was packed up until the p m fireworks it cleared out after that i have not see a lot of walk up healthy options if you want to have a meal that is not chicken strips burgers dogs pizza and such you need to do a sit own restaurant which are not always available at the meal times with those on dining plan i have to say one thing that is really discouraging about disney is that every year when we go back the service gets worse when you have been going annually you see the drop offs each year where it becomes frustrating for the money being spent and with the disney brand you expect a certain level of service we pay the same or less for universal and in both california and orlando have received notably better service there i am not sure if they pay them more or what but it s really a night and day comparison the past few years frankly it s kind of sad to see the slow decline at the disney parks i suppose for the time being disney can continue to let thing decline until they get some more fierce competition universal really has them beat right now on both the consistent level of customer service across all of their properties and the healthy food options available ,3,2017-10-15
5531,Magical Place,we are a disney fanatic family and try to go as often as we can we absolutely love disneyland for younger kids the parks are not so far apart and they are not so big either they have a very great vibe because they are smaller if you have young kids years disneyland it s your best bet for sure have fun it s the happiest place on earth,5,2017-10-11
5532,"A Must Visit, But...",everyone should visit disneyland and on weekends that s what it feels like everyone visits all at once expect large crowds long waits in line and pricey food and souvenirs on the pro side it is dis dylan s with all of the classic attractions best is the superb fireworks show the friendliness of the cast and the plethora of things to see do and experience on the con side too many people feel compelled to bring little babies and toddlers into the park kids that small don t recollect anything they are over stimulated and don t last that long lots of crying screaming kids how many due to overindulgent parents is only a guess but probably lots so all the babies make for a sea of strollers they are parked everywhere many things are tolerable but the non thinking and discourteous parents who insist on pushing those obnoxious double wide strollers everywhere get on my nerves in many places especially shops restaurants and in lines double wide strollers just don t belong best advise invest in fast passes and park hopper tickets go early in the morning when the temps and crowds are lower plan what rides and attractions you want to visit and do them first wear comfortable walking shoes and cotton clothing thick socks wear sunscreen plan your meals well drink lots of water be patient and expect some fairly rotten human behavior and expect to witness lots of poor parenting that said it s disneyland probably good for one annual visit ,4,2017-10-11
5533,Rude employee,we came across the rudest employee it was later in the night so maybe he was tired but that doesn t give him the right to talk to us they way he did i usually go to disneyland about twice a year even on the hottest days with the longest lines i always leave having had a good time this time however our group left shocked that someone spoke to us like that ,4,2017-10-10
5534,Get the Disneyland App and use Fastpass,the purpose of this review is to give advice on how to avoid much of the pain around the lines at disneyland before going install the disneyland app when you go pay an extra bucks to get fastpass then use you app to book fastpass for the rides you want and hour or so ahead it does mean you need to plan a bit and it does mean you may need a battery charger by mid afternoon however it will cut you line time by which is critical if you want to keep your year old kid from going insane ,5,2017-10-10
5535,Fun! Food! An experience worth having,disneyland park was so much fun for me in my middle age get the maxpass and use the fastpass as often as you can it s worth it everything is overpriced but it still is a fun experience ,5,2017-10-09
5536,Had a great time but park gets crowded very easily,my first time in disneyland having been to disney world in florida many times yes everything is on a much bigger scale in florida and there is more there but i liked the quaintness and charm this park had plus it had some of the best rides from florida big thunder mountain space mountain splash mountain haunted mansion pirates of the caribbean etc we visited initially on a sunday big mistake and then again on the tuesday it was insanely busy wait times weren t too bad until early afternoon i would say but because of the narrower walkways and less space in this park everywhere just felt so crowded i thought this might of been as it was a sunday but tuesday was similar too albeit not as bad wait times got ridiculously long and lines for food were often really long as well obviously its not disney s fault thats it gets very busy but my advice would to be prepared for it especially as in this park you really feel the crowds as there s quite a lot packed into a small space a side note we got the maxpass which is currently per person per day and allows you to make fastpass from the disneyland app on your phone instead of walking all the way back and forth across the park plus photopass the fastpass i say was worth it but where are all the photopass photographers we found this in both parks but especially here even at character meet and greets we had to get the people standing in line behind us to use our phone camera and they were few and far between throughout the park ,5,2017-10-09
5537,Happiest place on earth!,a place for all ages to enjoy i ve been there times and can t get enough of both disneyland and the california adventure park i d say you need days minimum to explore both of the parks and visit all the attractions ,5,2017-10-07
5538,First timers to Disneyland,this was our first trip to disneyland and we brought our and year olds we had the best time bring that we only had full days to spend in the parks we chose to do the park hopper pass option it was totally worth it we loved california adventure but we spent one full day there and felt like we had done it all there was so much to do at disneyland here are a few pointers suggestions be sure to download the app so you can plan your day more efficiently and follow the wait times don t miss the dole whip be sure to see the fantasmic show watch at least one parade see the fireworks at the castle bibbidi bobbidi boutique for the castle experience and jedi training for boys ,5,2017-10-07
5539,Early October had the lightest crowd we've seen.,ending the year of our annual passes we came the first week in october and saw the lightest crowd we d seen all year food was great as always and we had a good time just wish they d pre publish ride closures for refurbishment farther in advance ,5,2017-10-06
5540,Most Magical Place on Earth,you d think a person would get tired of doing the same thing every year with disneyland trips in the books in the past years since having our kids we can honestly say we ve sampled most of what the disneyland park has to offer that being said it still hasn t gotten old from the moment you walk in you are immersed in absolute magic the cast members make the trip amazing from the men and women in white who keep the park looking spotless to the ride operators to the costumed characters and princesses to the photopass photographers everyone seems to go out of their way to make your visit amazing my older daughter is a thrill ride junkie age and can spend days riding all the rides between the disneyland fastpass system and now maxpass and their rider switch system which accomodates families who have smaller children that don t meet the height requirement for the ride my daughter is able to ride all her favorite rides multiple times and without waiting overly long our younger daughter age is happy riding rides or even just exploring and people watching disneyland makes it magical for each of them even though they enjoy the park in very different ways a lot of people seem to hesitate taking their younger children but definitely don t my year old had her first trip ate months and my year old has been times starting at months old and bonus kids under are free disneyland is definitely not a cheap undertaking but in my opinion the price is completely justified by the experience and feeling you get while in the park definitely make sure to get a multi day ticket whether you decide to park hop or not and make sure to utilize things like fastpass and maxpass to make your trip even more enjoyable ,5,2017-10-06
5541,Disneyland park,this was my th visit to disneyland and i love it i guess i am just a big kid at heart but i love it every one should visit here ,5,2017-10-06
5542,It’s not Disney world...,after going to disney world in orlando multiple times we were a little disappointed with disneyland we knew it was older and smaller but the park just isn t as bright or exciting as the one in orlando staff wasn t overly friendly no one really smiled colors weren t as bright park wasn t as clean not as much to cater to adults here as expected would recommend for families with smaller children but not for adults only or families with only older kids i expected it to be at least at the top of not over it but it was just ordinary ,3,2017-10-05
5543,Still the very best,other parks have tried but there isn t anything comparable to the original disneyland prices keep going up but that s true of every competitor as well and they can t match the ambience or excitement of this family favorite ,5,2017-10-04
5544,Great family mini-vacation spot,went up to anaheim fro san diego for a short vacation to visit the disney parks and we were not disappointed going at the beginning of october meant there were shorter wait times for most of the rides which i have to say disney has that figured out pretty well how to keep people flowing thru the rides we arrived as the park opened and were able to get most of the larger rides done by noon then spent the rest of our time at the park checking out the smaller rides shows and shopping very clean facility and the staff was very friendly from security all the way thru the different parts of the park looking forward to going back again ,5,2017-10-03
5545,"My lifelong addiction with Disney parks started here, but I was disappointed this time.",i ve always loved this park and it has always held a dear place in my heart but this trip it did let me down a little while i know there is construction and that haunted mansion and space mountain were closed for their conversions to the halloween overlays but i still found things lacking the biggest problem seemed to be the staff as a former disney world cast member entertainment and operations a wdw annual pass holder for years and a lifelong visitor of disney parks i know how things should run at a disney park and this was not it on our first day at the park it took us nearly hours in the park before we actually completed a ride we were queue dumped from or attractions that had gone down then walked off of pirates of the caribbean then walked off of the matterhorn and queue dumped from another attractions we finally rode the railroad around as it was actually open and running our second day was better but we did get walked off of splash mountain i think i saw more backstage at disney in days than i did in years working at wdw but we were also flat out lied to by cast members on multiple occasions about fast passes being put back on our account we had even paid for the upgrade but in the end we did have a good time but the lack of a daily nighttime show or parade was a let down and dining wasn t the best from a food quality service perspective i hope the park can resolve these issues before our next visit ,3,2017-10-03
5546,Bring your passport,if you want to drink at disney and you are from outside of usa they will not let you drink by showing your regular photo id you need your passport we waited in line for min for a beer and were denied it once we got to the counter so disappointing we are from canada we are barely foreign anyways fun and clean park otherwise good food but not a lot of choice ,3,2017-10-02
5547,Great,i dont know what to say this is seconde time that i have been there and i will come back again for sure i feel so good when i am in the park everythin is great clean and staff is so friendly see you soon,5,2017-10-02
5548,Different than WDW in FL,we re from the east coast so disney world as been fully experienced we visited disneyland looking for new experience and found it we enjoyed fantasyland s ride with mr toad not found in fl while we expected the matterhorn bobsleds to be similar to expedition everest we were very wrong the food offerings were also quite different although still disney premium priced we were grateful to locate an ihop and denney s walking distance from the bus depot area we brought refillable bottles for the water fountains throughout the park ,4,2017-10-02
5549,Family Adventure,we were there on a sunday weather was good and crowds weren t too bad until about noon get there an hour before opening they actually opened the turnstiles at so we had an extra half hour in fantasy land with no lines at all the max pass was great however you could not get the fantasmic fast pass that way you have to physically go to the riverboat dock to get a paper fastpass a number of the rides shut down several times with the max pass you then can use the pass on any ride so we ended up several use it anywhere passes and just booked a new fast pass when the closed ride started up again food is expensive we ended up sharing meals also there was no problem with taking in packaged snacks or bottled water if you want a pineapple whip get it early in the day when the line is short we waited til late afternoon and the line was enormous so did wait the minutes for it we were also able to get free ice in a cup when we ordered meals parade times draw a lot of people away from the rides can t do everything in one day but we did do everything we cared about ,5,2017-10-02
5550,First trip to Disneyland! Sisters and cousin trip,this was my first trip to california and disneyland i wanted to walk in walt s footsteps and experience the park where it all began it did not disappoint so quaint historical and magical i can t wait to bring my children and husband cross country to experience the park with days of park time we were able to experience almost all of the attractions missed you monorail and autopia i d recommended the max pass on a weekend but weekdays are lighter in crowd levels and manageable mickey s halloween party is a must just to watch all of the costumes we had the blue bayou frightfully fun parade dining package and felt it was worth it this allows the party for a special dinner and preferred parade viewing areas i can t wait to return to this magical land again see ya real soon ,5,2017-10-02
5551,Busy But Still Magical,we went at the end of september and disneyland closed early on selected days for halloween if you had a hopper everyone went to california adventure park was extremely busy at both parks and very long ride waits on rides would have thought having such huge amounts of people go through the turnstiles the parks would have closed late but california adventure park closed at pm and disneyland closed at pm try to avoid going on the weekend but having said all of this disneyland is truly a magical place ,4,2017-10-01
5552,last Hoorah for the older Folks 60+,we had free tickets for the park september is a great time to go during the week not as much crowds and we managed our time well with the fast pass and the wait lines yes some of the rides broke down but we were able to use our fast pass for another ride then the ride we want was back on line you have to manage your time and check what you really want to see go early and head for the ride you want we enjoyed all the rides but this will be it unless we have grandchildren that want to go some day getting a little too old for roller coasters,4,2017-10-01
5553,This truly is the happiest place on earth,loved it the parades are so out of this world amazing lots to do of course lots to see rides for all ages definitely will return over and over again the prices of food is a little pricey but not like they harsh gouge you like nassau bahamas lol the espressos around the park are seriously to die for i think about it often make sure obviously to wear good good walking shoes lots and lots of walking we went before christmas time there was rain a little bit here and there which was perfect no line ups all the rides are inside anyway i can t tell you our favorite ride because they are all unique in their own way bring pennies for the penny squishing machines makes affordable souvenirs that s for sure i would recommend bringing your own water because it s pretty pricey in the park we also brought a back pack and grabbed chips to snack on until meal time ,5,2017-10-01
5554,Always Fun But Not What It Used To Be,you can t help but have a good time at disneyland but the crowds keep getting worse prices keep going up and it s just not as enjoyable as it used to be during our recent magic morning twice we stood in lines for rides that broke down very frustrating ,5,2017-10-01
5555,Skyline Lounge Experience - Tomorrowland,for per person you get a vip access to the skyline lounge experience which promises stellar views to the fireworks show along with lounge seating games refreshments and all you can manage hot and cold drinks first off the entrance to this experience was not lit at all not easy to find and tough to find information on the actual disney web page once you find it you are told the seating is first come first served so get there early to get your spot in line you have to check in at the kiosk first to pay and get your bracelets for your party once they let you in they take you to assigned seating therefore it is not actually first come first served as we were led past open seats that had better vantage points than the one we were given i spoke up and the cast member was at first uncomfortable to explain to us that the area we passed that had better views was reserved for a party of when i pressed her for how they were able to reserve that when we were all told it was first come first served she explained that they set up the seating based on the reservations hmmm she did manage to move us to the party of spot they never showed up by the way and i heard her say the same speech to multiple other parties she sat after walking them by the better seating bad customer experience for disney but true to form they corrected it mickey and minnie did come out to interact with guests take pictures however they are not allowed to take pictures with guests of the two of them together as that would cause everyone to want to do the same huh so despite the fact the two of them stood in front of us at the same time waiting we weren t allowed to do a double photo op i though this was a little strange and then we observed minnie spending about minutes at the end playing games and interacting much more with one of the parties it appears that you aren t allowed to ask for a double photo but the characters themselves can choose how they spend their time and with whom they spend it interesting the dessert box like disney was ultra sweet basically souped up hostess treats i suspect there is a partnership here with some boursin cheese jazzed up with bacon bits and cheese with crackers a tiny stem of grapes and all the drinks you can manage the beverage selection was nice coffee was good and you need it as you are seated around and the fireworks don t start until pm beware you have to leave the attraction to use the restrooms over by space mountain or autopia as they aren t available here in all honesty we booked this for the opportunity to sit down and have a nice view of the fireworks did it provide all that and more not really having a quiet uncrowded seat for a while was quite nice the food was meh the view of the fireworks pretty terrible actually yes you can see part of the matterhorn disney s excellent horticulture prowess provides stunning landscaping to the park and that becomes a hindrance when it comes to full firework display views we saw tinkerbell for only a brief moment and all of the lights and graphics that are an integral part of the show flashed on the castle and the mountain are completely lost behind the trees as well as the tomorrowland rockets and architecture what a shame if disney came up with something like this with better views of all the action i d say its worth the and perhaps even more just for that as for me i will save my money and time until they come up with a better option and skip this experience which i suspect will become one of a long line of failures for the america sings attraction ,3,2017-09-29
5556,First time at the original park,really enjoyed seeing the first disney park with good mix of disney favourites small world haunted mansion and different rides like the matterhorn highlights for us were seeing the dapper dans perform and looking around toontown it was also our first halloween park experience the decorations were really good although we were actually a little disappointed by the mickey s not so scary halloween party that we bought tickets for we did enjoy the halloween parade and the opportunity to meet halloween characters overall a good experience though and we would return although maybe at a different time of year ,4,2017-09-29
5557,Reservations,we were shocked at how many sit down restaurants at disney require reservations with many tables sitting empty and walk in customers being turned away i would suggest looking into booking reservations or you may go hungry ,3,2017-09-27
5558,Still a place to tick off that must do and see,we went with our grandchild and their parents we and the children had a magical time and having had a park hopper pass and one early morning we managed to do most of the rides and some twice we were disappointed that several of the rides were down for maintenance and some broke down while we were waiting for them especially if we had been inline for quite some time in f degree heat we had waited for the fireworks display one night in a position we thought was suitable only to be told that after an hour that this was a place we couldn t stay we approached some staff members who had seen us sitting there for that length of time only to be told that we would be moved off as some vip s were going to be seated there when we said we had waited there for that length of time their reply was it wasn t their department and we could take it up with management a bit late as to tell us just before the display wasn t it other than that a very enjoyable days ,5,2017-09-25
5559,Halloween time Disneyland is awesome!,i have visited disneyland many times before and i was pleased to find it just as magical as i remember definitely download the app before you go and if you are going fri sat or sun invest in the maxpass it s well worth the money especially if you are park hopping the halloween decorations are great and the switch to nightmare before christmas from the haunted mansion is fabulous ,5,2017-09-25
5560,Disney World Pass Holders find fun at Disneyland and California Adventure!!,comparison to the magic kingdom it s smaller in scale pathways are smaller so crowding seems heavy no bands so systems are slower entry gate does not have a no bags line so you have to wait as almost everyone else is getting their bags checked seems like everyone brings food and drinks something we did at magic kingdom until we found just not worth the hassle and you get in and around easier don t be too surprise of the size of the castle we walked in and though where s the other half fast passes are issued only in the park and either by old system of getting them by the attraction or getting the max pass app which is well worth the price tag plus you get all the pictures taken through out the day sent to your phone app lines look longer since they don t have the hidden line concept in several attraction like at dw you see a line of people in the walk ways and think that is too long to wait then find out that it is only a min line visited during the halloween set up at the haunted mansion and space mountain both worth the trip other attraction differences indiana jones matterhorn pirates much more to see guardians overall spent full days and fell like we saw and did almost everything between both parks rode several attraction numerous times p s walking distance from most hotels or uber to drop off point with no issues unlike our park the entrance to these parks are right off the main road ,5,2017-09-23
5561,Practical Summary,this review will be in the form of points hitting what i thought are important aspects related to visiting disneyland and adventure parks days are not enough to see everything and get on most of the rides in both parks seems to be a good number of days and more than that is bonus that might be necessary if you have kids buy what ever number of days online and add more days at the park and you won t be paying more than what you would pay originally for that number of days online this is as long as you do so by pm on the last day of you ticket for example you bought a day park hopper ticket and want to add one more day you can do so at any ticket booth before pm on day of the days you have if you miss that and want to buy one more day you ll pay waaay more take a few bottles of frozen water bottles to save some money you ll probably have to buy some there anyway as you can only take so much water and what you take will eventually get too warm to drink you d save some money anyway take advantage of the early happy hour and make sure it is included in the ticket this can give you an opportunity to get on rides that get so busy later on such as guardians of the galaxy and cars racing in radiator springs where the waiting time can exceed an hour book your lunch or dinner as soon as you get in the park ariel s grotto restaurant provides tickets to the world of color show at the lake by micky s wheel they are vip tickets with the best spot to watch the show so it s worth it as that restaurant is pretty pricy lovely food too take the park hopper ticket as most probably you or your kids will want to see or do something in the other park at some point during the day when you park your car whether outside or at the parking structure you walk to the security checkpoint after the checkpoint comes the area where you get on the shuttle carts that take you to the parks when that checkpoint becomes too crowded they advise people to walk to the park if you don t mind walking for around min then go ahead otherwise just wait it will take as much time or even less sun screen is a must and a cap if you are bald like i am ,5,2017-09-23
5562,Another Nice Visit,while not the size of disney world this park still delivers on this visit my family and i decided to concentrate on the california adventure park as is always the case with any disney property this park was immaculate the ride formally known as the tower of terror is now the guardians of the galaxy while not as fun it is still a thrill ,4,2017-09-22
5563,Truly Magic!,this is my happy place and i always have a blast i do wish they could do something about the crowds and long lines though but i never get tired of disneyland ,5,2017-09-21
5565,"Special place, but save up your dollars",as everyone knows disneyland is a fantastic place to visit the staff are fantastic ever single one of them the park is immaculately clean the rides are fantastic and the food is lovely with many options we spent days between disneyland and california adventure and every hour was worth it just a heads up binoculars are not allowed in the parks i am a birdwatcher and wanted to see a few local birds but was sent back by security as binoculars are a prohibited item go figure i have no problem with that in principle but it would have been nice to have them listed on the prohibited items list that they publish on their website then i wouldn t have brought them ,5,2017-02-21
5566,My favorite,disneyland is my favorite of all parks visited with all the different worlds to see fun rides and just a great atmosphere once visited disney in hong kong and noticed a difference of not too many characters walking around a lot of my old favourites like donald duck not to be seen thinking it was the time of year their not so busy if u can say that seemed packed some of the worlds were closed for maintenance like the paddle steamer etc but they have to maintain at sometime for safety hate to see what it is like peak season guessing this is why i rated star but just disneyland and i loved february weather perfect and still had huge line ups at some rides but not as bad as peak,4,2017-02-21
5567,Not the same Disneyland we recalled as a kids,first time visit with our year old boys i haven t been here since the mid s tried to pick off season disappointed at the massive amount of people with strollers everywhere long lines minute plus wait times most popular rides were closed for repairs disappointing and were hoping for a real disney experience for our kids first time failed miserably food court prices ridiculous would think with the high cost of admission you wouldn t need to make a fortune on food also restrooms dirty but the grounds were fairly clean considering the mass amount of people who can t clean up after themselves doubt the kids will want to return they didn t even talk about it much so sad ,3,2017-02-21
5568,"Lots of fun, with a high price tag",i grew up going to disney so i still love going as an adult without kids there are lots of fun rides and the whole park is laid out with a lot of thought toe great design my personal favorite rides are buzz lightyear and space mountain with serious nostalgia points for dumbo and the tiki room ,4,2017-02-20
5569,Absolutely Packed,stupidly only planned half a day at this park on a sunday on a holiday weekend huge mistake every ride had at least an hour wait we made it onto the third ride roger rabbit we waited at least an hour and a half were about minutes out from the cars when the ride broke totally sucked by that time we were all tired hungry and out of sorts from the east coast to west coast time change had to split to let the child go to bed bathrooms not abundant the fast pass system at these west coast parks blows no magic bands no preselecting your rides before you come line for fast pass can be minutes itself if you can find them at all disneyland really needs to update its antiquated system and take some pages out of disneyworld s playbook no magic express either or signage at airport stand at center median and at approximately of every hour the bus will pick u up and stop at all eight terminals make restaurant reservations well ahead of time or starve ,3,2017-02-20
5570,Always a great time!,the staff are always so friendly and make you have a great time while there we came president s day weekend and it was a good time to go the lines were not as bad as in the summer we were able to get on space mountain twice and star tours times ,5,2017-02-20
5571,Our favorite place,disneyland is unlike anything you ve experienced before truly magical and great for people of all ages my husband and i come to disneyland at least once a month perfect get away ,5,2017-02-20
5572,Happiest Place on Earth.....,the park opened at am the park was themed in halloween in main street area goofy and pluto were in the main street area for pictures the characters rotate throughout the day however most of the mickey mouse characters are in toontown all day so you can meet them use your fastpass for space mountain as it is one of the rides with the longer lines however we must of had a good day we didnt wait longer than mins for any ride all day matterhorn bobsled is fun but had malfunction issues during the day splash mountain is another one you may want to use your fast pass for the parade is daily at pm and down the main street get there early for a good spot or avoid that area if you dont want to see itor get stuck in the traffic the food prices are expensive as usual for any theme park the amount of scooter and strollers is almost dangerous as there are so many they take up the whole walkways ,5,2017-02-20
5573,Over priced and over crowded. I'm over it!,the reasons why you should save your hard earned money lineups are unbelievable sometimes hours long for rides lines for food stores bathrooms characters and everything else the characters are jerks except mickey and minnie we only saw approx in days they were too busy to give the kids the time of day the food is ridiculously overpriced and yucky bring your own food and snacks starwars and buzzlight year rides are a blast go early and get fast passes tonight we kept our kids up hours past their bedtime to watch the fireworks only to have them be over an hour late we called it before then and put the kids to bed there is so much wrong with disneyland it s hard to fully express it the lines the money spent both to get in the park and then while your there the push to buy merchandise the rude staff characters and guests and the crowds oh and bring excellent shoes there isn t a lot of opportunities to sit down also if you have food allergies such as gluten or dairy bring your own food for sure there is next to nothing to eat that accommodates dietary restrictions apart from those massive disgusting turkey legs people are walking around eating bottom line any magic that may have been at disneyland is gone ,1,2017-02-20
5574,Disneyland is a must see,it s disneyland i love it we go to disney world florida every other year or so but since we live on the other side of the country our visits to disneyland aren t as numerous but they are special i recommend visiting between october and december so you can experience the nightmare before christmas haunted mansion ride layover it s really fantastic in november small world is all decked out for christmas with the dolls singing jingle bells instead of the usually song there are rides here you won t find in disneyworld and this park is smaller so you can do it all in or days we stay for or and see california adventure park too and usually an outside area attraction hollywood san diego etc ,5,2017-02-20
5575,RAINING LIKE CRAZY,wet but still the happiest place on earth great food and drinks loved the old classic rides in disneyland can not wait to goo back,5,2017-02-19
5576,Who doesnt love Disney?,visited disneyland with adult women got there when it opened and left when it closed the park was clean efficiently run and a pleasure to visit there were a number of ride attractions that were closed but that is to be expected plenty of things to do to entertain yourself ,5,2017-02-19
5577,Disneyland,we brought our toddlers here and had a fabulous time i m so glad we took the advice of others who encouraged people to go ahead and bring their littles even though they are probably too young to remember much of this trip on their own we will never forget the magical day we had together ,5,2017-02-18
5578,Magical,disneyland park is by far the best theme park i ve ever been to it has something for everyone and can capture a sense of magic no matter your age gender or belief despite always being packed i love the ticketed fast pass system and over days you can just relax and really enjoy the park with everything it has on offer you really need to spend the time to appreciate everything in the park and not just rush it you will miss things if you don t really take the time to walk around check out everything really make note of every little detail ,5,2017-02-18
5579,Checked off the Bucket list,having been to walt disney world over times it was a dream to experience disneyland as well we went on monday and were in line minutes before rope drop we were able to ride several rides before the park got too crowded so it s worth getting up earlier for take advantage of fastpass to maximize your time spent on rides as usual for disney the park was clean and employees were generally friendly and accommodating and the queues before the rides were immersive for the story ride easily could have spent another day there exploring the park watching parades shows and riding rides an on a scale ,5,2017-02-18
5581,The Happiest Place on Earth :),my friends and i did a day park hopper pass last week when we visited anaheim for us that was more than enough time for us to do everything that we wanted as it seems like this time of the year is a slow time for the parks biggest tips are to use the disneyland apps and to take advantage of the fast passes even with it being a slow time of the year we were able to plan out our rides and check wait times to make sure that we were able to ride multiples times we took advantage of our park hooper by getting a fast pass in one park and then going to the next park to get another one you can have one fast pass per park at a time such a good trip and i ll definitely be back ,4,2017-02-18
5582,Always a good time,been here before this time it rained all day crowds were down so they closed hours early we payed full price ready to play and the sent us out of the park ,5,2017-02-18
5584,Went for day,it s an amazing place they don t miss any details if you plan it right you can hit all the rides without huge lines we have one year old and she loved it ,5,2017-02-18
5585,Magical,every single person deserves a visit to disney land truly magical wonderful and delightful this is for all ages ,5,2017-02-18
5587,Magical,i ve loved disneyland since i was a kid and now i m taking my children to see it and experience the magic of disney this time around seemed like lots of rides had problems but we still had a great time grab a turkey leg a churro and a dole whip if you get the chance they are all amazing ,5,2017-02-17
5588,"C'mon, it's Disneyland!!!!",seriously this is disneyland of course it s gonna be great my boyfriend and i visited in the christmas holidays and it was magical we also stayed it the hotel and it had amazing benefits like the magic hour a bit crowded but amazing ,5,2017-02-17
5589,Fun,the original disney it s amazing how little has changed since my first visit to the park years ago it s a small world splash mountain and space mountain are still the way i remember them from when i was to me this is what adds to the charm of the park some drawbacks are the lines to get on some of the rides it was a pleasant surprise when we stood in a line with a minute wait and we would get through in minutes or less but if you wanted to go to the star wars themed exhibits you would be waiting as much as minutes the other drawback was the line for the food i don t really understand why people feel the need to get up to the counter and start talking about their lives there s three menu items you can choose from pick whatever you re ordering pay and step to the side no need to give the back story as to why your kid loves the clam chowder overall i had a wonderful experience ,4,2017-02-17
5590,Disney has lost it's charm,too crowded too pricey and has lost it s charm disneyland of the s s s and s was a wonderful place to visit it has lost all charm if you enjoy standing line line at the dmv you will love this place everything has a price tag on it and now all the rides exit to their overpriced gift shops i ll bet walt is just rolling over in his grave ,1,2017-02-17
5591,Fun at Disneyland,things have changed since i was last at disney years ago i had tons of fun though and had a great time i totally recommend this for the entire family ,5,2017-02-17
5592,After 8 Years,it s been eight years since i last visited disneyland and it s sister park this past week was great with the exception of pirates of the caribbean and the matterhorn closed for renovations and the disneyland railroad closed due to construction my family went on many of the rides haunted mansion the most ridden ride of our trip space mountain is fantastic in its new star wars theme once again glad to have made it out there ,5,2017-02-17
5593,LOVE IT HERE,one of my all time favorite theme parks to go to i have and will to continue have many lasting memories here when i m here i feel like i m at home where i feel the most comfortable i have so much fun here i don t care how busy it gets cause it does a lot there s always things to do my favorite ride is splash mountain i love the full circle of emotion this ride portrays from happiness to sadness loss and making new friends i will continue to always go here at least once a year only thing that s ridiculous tickets are way to expensive disney has a ton of money they should lower the prices so more people can enjoy it ,4,2017-02-17
5594,Amazing,amazing place had a blast from start to finish wish restaurants had better choices for vegetarians rides were great and took advantage of fast pass option love the energy here ,5,2017-02-17
5595,Great family fun,always a favorite family trip make sure to plan for at least three days and have a park hopper pass a day in each park plus a third day to go back and get the stuff you missed ,5,2017-02-17
5596,Ride closures,disney never fails to make a family vacation great we wete somewhat disappointed however with some closure of several popular rides that we were looking forward to experiencing in particular was thunder mt pirates of the caribbean some restaurants had great healthy menu choices while others were somewhat poorly designed ,3,2017-02-17
5597,Christmas at Disneyland,my husband and i spent our first christmas together we got there as the park opened and we went right to the pirates ride then haunted mansion then to splash mountain and never waited in a line we spent the morning doing so much and never waited in a line by the park was packed we went back to our hotel for a rest and went back later we were able to get on some rides right away as single riders we found that to work out great for us disney on christmas is a blast it did get really crowded but that is to be expected ,5,2017-02-16
5598,Always amazing and crowded,disneyland is one of my favorite places to visit however it had been so crowded the last few times that we decided to come during february to see if we could beat the crowds we were wrong it was just as crowded as usual and it didn t seem any better than any other time of year that being said i still love disneyland and will continue to go it is just unrealistic to expect days where it is not packed it is best to come prepared with a plan and to use the fast passes to get on the rides with longer rides we found even though it s not fun to get up early it is the best option if taking a toddler it was the only way we were able to get on rides with out waiting at least minutes the afternoon lines were all minutes or more i highly recommend going but i would definitely recommend having a plan and getting a multiple day pass so you have lots of time to relax and ride all the rides ,4,2017-02-16
5599,Closed some of the best rides.,make sure you call and check to see what is opened what rides are closed will never be able to take my grandkids there again because it is so expensive and miss ing pirates of the caribbean and the mountain on was a let down ,5,2017-02-16
5600,Always a bright shining star!!,we have multiple food allergies and disney was amazing we had to talk to the chefs watch meal and often times they would have to make something for us from scratch they were awesome ,5,2017-02-16
5601,Way too crowded,rides were good as lines were not to long although it was a pity that many sections of the park were closed for refurbishment ,3,2017-02-16
5602,Everyone in the family enjoyed this theme park.,this visit was adults with no kids so remember that as you read this we were in and out in hours and half of that was standing in line for the nemo submarine ride i ve been to disney world hundreds of times so when you see cinderella s castle here it just seems sad if you have kids i m sure you would enjoy it because of all the princesses and characters you can visit and it s a just a good family park i would probably go back to california adventures before i came here again ,4,2017-02-16
5603,Lots of fun with long lines,my family and i were there on during what disney considers there off season ha it s like any other theme park across the us with a lot more adventure it was lots of fun but you have to wait to enjoy the rides they offer a fast pass but for more atop of what you just spent on the entrance ticket the popular characters also had a long line only got a picture with goofy which is my personal favorite food is ok ,4,2017-02-15
5604,one day,this park can easily be done in day if you are short on time to allow you to get the whole experience,5,2017-02-15
5605,Yippee!,we had the greatest time ever got our pictures taken with chewbacca and darth vader freindly helpful staff at guest relations,5,2017-02-15
5606,My childhood renewed,looking forward to the new star wars area disneyland is one of my favorite places to visit in spite of the rate hikes and long lines but its truly a place to celebrate fun with friends and family ,5,2017-02-15
5607,Bad experience,i love disney and i had a great time through out the day unfortunely when my boyfriend and i were leaving we got stopped by a working that was saying we looked suspicious how do we look suspicious is it because we are latin i mean we were already outside of the park when he called us back in to do a random check what we are leaving home why do a check when you should of checked for weapons when we were about to enter the park not after racist much it didn t bother me until he would let all white people pass by but would stop hispanics wow i had a wallet idk what weapon would of fit in there but now i regret not leaving and denying to reenter the park just for a random check never going back i can t believe they will hire such racist people ,1,2017-02-15
5609,Fast Pass,fast pass not very helpful with long lines at popular attractions just saw that the prices are going up again ,3,2017-02-14
5610,Busiest day of the year!,we went to disneyland with other people the park was so crowded that we could not enjoy it disney has a brilliant idea of making the lines go onto the walking paths this makes it impossible to get around fast pass was full at every ride so we just had to wait in line they are trying to navigate crowd control and it is not working i was very disappointed and i spent a lot of to go i will not travel to disneyland for a very long time one of our family members had a huge panic attack and the only help we got was to walk through the shops i know that disney has another way out and to get around we just needed help getting our family member out without any more issues i was very disappointed in disney s lack of help ,2,2017-02-14
5611,A Fun 2 Days!,if you can a day ticket to the disneyland resort is a must this allows you to spend two days in disneyland and one day in california adventure disneyland is best during the offseason mid january early may excluding spring break where crowds are low you can experience most of the park this does come with a trade off quite a bit of the park can be under refurbishment construction there are several tools online to help with trip planning and i would suggest disneyland crowd calendar this can help you find what times are typically busy another useful tool is the refurbishment schedule that can be found on touringplans com food can be expensive if you choose to go to a premium dining location if you are looking for a good dining location for a date i would suggest the blue bayou you can expect a bill at the end but the meal is definitely worth it the atmosphere is romantic and the food is amazing ,5,2017-02-14
5612,Great Christmas vacations,we have a great time the only bad thing was the park was full and we could get in a lot of rides but the kids love it anyway we meet mickey and friend it was food,3,2017-02-14
5613,Lots of Fun!,we came here with a group of friends for a weekend and we had a great time together we were strategic with our fast passes so we were able to get on the majority of the rides in one day the only thing that sucked is of the most popular rides broke down in day while we were standing in line and we were only comped fast passes once ,4,2017-02-14
5614,The magic of Disney.,the magic is all around you here perfect for little ones disney isn t cheap but it s definitely worth it ,5,2017-02-14
5615,My Happy Place,disneyland will forever be one of my most favorite places on earth from the moment you enter through the turnstiles and walk down main street you are transported to a very special and magical place meticulous detail inspired design and artwork imaginative and engaging attractions peter pan s flight is my favorite attraction along with indiana jones hyperspace mountain great restaurants blue bayou is the best food in the park make sure to make dining reservations well ahead of your trip and incredible nighttime parades and fireworks disney has continued to build enhance polish expand and create even more magic can t wait for the new star wars land and i look forward to many more magical days spent at the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-02-14
5616,Everyone should experience Disneyland,disneyland does a fantastic job of entertaining they are especially great with handicapped and mentally challenged kids and adults the characters are engaging and their policy for handling people with challenges is great it is very expensive so plan to spend a fortune but it is truly an experience unlike anything you will ever experience it is considered the happiest place on earth and it is it can get very crowded so choose a time outside normal vacations and school holidays don t be put off by the weather even if it rains it s still enjoyable i think walt disney would be proud of what has become of his vision ,5,2017-02-14
5617,Happiest Place on Earth!,they advertise disneyland is the happiest place on earth and it really is it s fun for both kids and the adults all the staffs are nice and friendly i wish they can just lower the admission tickets if you can try to avoid the weekend as it gets really crowded and super long lines on most of the rides ,5,2017-02-14
5618,Amazing!!! Disneyland is perfect family friendly experience!!!,first when you come here you need to stay at one of the disney hotels so you can take advantage of the extra hour that disney opens this park in the morning for guest that are staying at one of these resorts as the park is pretty much empty by disney standards during this time you get free reign to ride as many rides as possible when my family went we stayed at the disneyland hotel which was about a minute walk to the park entrance when we got there there looks to be a huge line to get in but the line is relatively small when you consider how big disneyland is when you enter we went straight for the bigger rides so we avoid longer lines later hyper space mountain was amazing then star tours and the matterhorn disneyland just did a makeover to incorporate star wars into these attractions and they were amazing about this time is when the park opened to the rest of the crowd so we made out way over to indian jones and did adventure land and frontier land and did the attractions there as we went at the end of january there was not a lot of crowds well by disney standards the park was only about half capacity which meant that the longest line you would have to wait in was about minutes and fast passes had return times for about minutes from the time you got them so we would usually get a fast pass ride the ride and then come back with the fast pass to ride again with that strategy we got to ride space mountain indian jones and the thunder mountain railroad multiple times the day was capped off with the electrical light parade which took me back to my childhood all in all it was a great day at the park the crowds were low the food was great love the churros the lines short and enjoyed the very pleasant atmosphere truly one of the happiest places on earth go and enjoy it ,5,2017-02-14
5619,Don't WASTE your time.,i went to disneyland today feb and was not only disappointed but disgusted with disney management the park said a couple rides were closed while they built a star wars attraction however they made no mention that pirates of the caribbean and matterhorn were also closed who knows why so for your admission to park you got fewer rides and long lines even on a low attendance day then there was a car fire in the garage so they closed it as well as the trams people myself included were in the line waiting for a tram and we were told trams would be at the far end of downtown disney so we all walked a long distance only to be told no trams so walk to the garage another long distance upon arrival at the garage disney stall said it was closed to everyone because of the long ago extinguished fire so every had to stand wait two hours until the garage re opened if people had been told about the garage back in the park they could have done other things while waiting for admittance to the garage back in either park instead of standing around a lot with no seating and no bathrooms disney s management has atrocious communications skills and are bad at their jobs walt would roll over in his grave if he saw how disneyland s guests were treated save your money until you can fly to orlando and go to disneyworld i d rather burn bills than return to disneyland in anaheim ,2,2017-02-14
5620,Happiest Place on Earth,definitely and still is the happiest place on earth turns a grown man into a small boy again will bring the kids here next time love the place ,5,2017-02-14
5621,Short trip,short trip with my daughter and i disney was great as usual very crowded at times that is to be expected ,5,2017-02-13
5622,Birthday Celebration a blast,we went into disneyland on friday afternoon the lines for the rides were short the park was not very crowded and the perfect day to enjoy the park the dole whip was so delicious the beignets were beyond delicious most of the employees were very friendly angie the worker at the julep was the rudest person ever even after my poor treatment by angie i thought i would try it again the following day the worker i can t remember her name was also rude so apparently the workers at julep are unfriendly maybe a refresher course in customer service is needed i loved disneyland and will be back ,5,2017-02-13
5623,Make sure you plan for more time at California Adventure.,having come from disneyworld it s definitely smaller than orlando s magic kingdom but still as magical you can do both parks in day but would recommend getting a day pass as you can do disneyland in one day but you need more time for california adventure ,5,2017-02-13
5624,Celebrating Wife's / Mom's B-Day,great time at the happiest place on earth despite my wife s b day falling on an unusually rainy day at the park the thinner crowds allowed us to enjoy all our favorite rides in record time we were recognized by the staff throughout the park with our i m celebrating buttons and the b day girl appreciated the recognition her birthday button brought as socal residents we took advantage of day special ticket allowing for non consecutive day visits we ll be back in april and early may ,5,2017-02-13
5625,I was an excited 8 year old kid again!,this place is magical the details in every scenario is very impressive the light and firework show were like being inside one of their stories just magical hyperspace mountain was awesome if it were outside like a normal rollercoaster it would be cool but it s not you re in a dark tube with star wars battle going on all around you you re fully immersed in another world and you cannot see the track in front of you it s half rollercoaster and half virtual reality so the rollercoaster is cool but the production makes it amazing same story with the fireworks i ve been to vegas for new year s many times i have seen way more stuff explode in the sky and it was cool but disneyland had wayyyyy more production value to their show i can not imagine how anybody could possibly rival their firework show ,5,2017-02-13
5626,Happiest place in the universe,visited with my yr old daughter her first visit here we maximized times that had minimal crowds checked several websites and made liberal uses of fast passes recommend watching youtube videos for disneyland hacks tips recommendations our longest wait for a ride was minutes we got day military special passes for each best bargain ever all rides were magical except the sub ride good effects but smelly cramped ,5,2017-02-13
5627,We were speechless - our dream had come true!!!!!,disneyland was the absolute highlight of our anaheim trip we loved every minute we spent there it is truly the happiest place on earth and we experienced it to the max thank you disneyland ,5,2017-02-13
5628,LOL....Who does not like Disneyland,disneyland has just brought back it s light parade so awesome disneyland has also started a new fire work show the new fire works show has a light show intermingled the show has various different story lines behind each display don t miss the fireworks for sure ,5,2017-02-13
5629,"Disney ""lines""",waaaay too many lines up to hours just to get on a ride the worst is the attitude of the personnel we were at the light parade at pm and we were enforced to keep walking since all really few spots to see the parade were already taken the rest of us were yieled to keep walking by staff demand walt disney personnel was aggresively shouting and enforcing nobody would standing still when we were able to secure a spot for the pm parade we hit the worst we were siting on the side walk together with other group of people and this lady from the staff in an aggressive attitude yelled at us to stand up this was the first time we were able to sit since the staff was not allowing us to stand still since pm that is when we realized the parade was not for the tourists the parade was for the satisfaction of the waltdisney personnel making the visitors to do their will i was just next to a nice couple with a teenager they were out of the allowed limit designated by a white rope one of the staff members came and order them to keep moving the gentleman said no that they were tired of walking and that they would like to be allowed to rest few minutes standing still the staff member kept shouting at them to keep moving we were all really unconfortable nice for the happiest place on earth shame on the waltdisney staff and management that enforces a military approach to manage tourists be aware that as a visitor you are not important to them i have been in other theme parks like universal studios and six flags disneyland has been an isolated bad experience and for what i saw i was not the only one with that impression ,1,2017-02-13
5630,Meh. Overrated.,i have been to disneyland times i probably won t go back until i have an year old kid currently childless so not for a long time the park doesn t care about overcrowding and the ridiculous amount of strollers they want your for the day and don t care about line wait times or park capacity of the main attractions were closed which was a bummer it s just too pricey for two people to spend a day waiting in line for rides what s the point knotts berry farm and universal studios are x better and have half the issues and are more economical ,3,2017-02-13
5631,I took my boys to Disney where I went as a child,it was truly magical taking my family to disneyland this was where i went with my family as a child the park has well maintained parts of the old disney and has so many expansions it was incredible i would definitely recommend bringing your family to disneyland in california ,5,2017-02-13
5632,Fun Times always!!,my family and i have been to disneyland times now we just returned last week we had days there we kept busy everyday there is so much to do and see and they add new things to keep it interesting it is a very busy place some days more busy than others but remember water walking shoes you do a lot camera and just have fun ,5,2017-02-12
5633,"The original, still the best",while not as expansive and geared toward a long vacation like its florida sibling this park still has that charm of its s though i worry how all the new construction may change that still there s magic here and it has the best version of both pirates and it s a small world if you can come during the holidays for the special version of haunted mansion all the better ,5,2017-02-12
5634,Happy place on earth,love it great trip especially since we went on the slowest time some rides were down and it was very pricey but it was an awesome trip ,5,2017-02-12
5635,Disney Land is Magical Until your an adult.,i am not saying i dislike it but here is my thoughts it costs too much its usually too crowded lines for princesses autographs and any other characters were way long we basically spent the day waiting for autographs looking for places to sit and after fantasmic they pretty much herd you out of the park it was definitely still fun for the kid on the bright side it didn t take forever to get the kid fed or something to drink when she was thirsty and there was a few rides that she was willing to go on so yea mission accomplished for the toddler but i went alot as a kid and remembered it differently now i know why you my dad and step mom literally got into a fight there haha,5,2017-02-12
5636,Amazing,spent christmas eve and christmas day at the two parks after the fireworks the snow makers came on parades and decorations were better than expected if you don t have a bar code on your ticket go to the ticket booth first save you some line up time ,5,2017-02-12
5637,"magical, but hard to find days with low crods",prefer a park hopper to california adventure to a one park per day pass harder to find days with low crowds if you go off season the crowds are smaller however the park hours are also shorter and rides down for refurbishment i just find it less magical when it is crowded and the lines are so long still worth it though ,5,2017-02-12
5638,Trip to disneyland,return trip to disney visited in i noticed a few changes decided to eat different foods this time as ate too much quick service before most staff really nice and friendly apart from one that was really snappy called corina in toy mania ,5,2017-02-12
5639,Awesome experience,we bought s day park hopper ticket for disneyland and california adventure park it was well worth it we spent to hours at the parks each day ,5,2017-02-12
5640,Glad we were there off season.,we arrived at disneyland at am what a great day so glad we didn t go in summer you wouldn t be able to move wait lines were good mins max unfortunately due to some rain earlier the parade was cancelled moments before it was due to start the fireworks display went ahead and it was spectacular left the park at pm shattered i would recommend getting a shuttle bus to and from your hotel after a hour day the idea of even a short walk was not appealing ,4,2017-02-11
5641,Visit to Disneyland,disneyland was great the lines at the rides were not long for indiana jones hyper space and star tours use fast pass the mainstreet electrical parade was well worth seeing autopia is not the same with support from honda rather than chevron if you are a star wars fan there is a display about the history of star wars you can meet darth vader chewbaccs and other characters the food is reasonably priced they will accomodate food allergies ,5,2017-02-11
5642,Loved it!!!,this was the first time i ve been to disney in such a long time and it was truly fantastic the weather was so hot but it was still a great day would probably recommend a couple of days we only did one day but felt we were able to squeeze the main rides in you can get fast passes for rides but they have time limits and limits on how often you can get them i would recommend getting the space mountain one first we didn t and it broke down temporarily and then the wait time stayed at over an hour for the rest of the day would also recommend doing splash mountain early in the day as the time we got for it it had to close unexpectedly and when we got to ride it we got soaked and didn t properly dry for the rest of the day the star wars ride was good i m not a big star wars fan but it was a good experience haunted mansion great buzz lightyear astro blasters more suited for kids but it got my competitiveness going big thunder mountain fast rollercoaster loved it and screamed most of the way round mad hatter tea party everyone loves spinning cups roger rabbits car toon spin spinning cars like a big kid food the food was mostly fast food and was very busy at meal times but we didn t find it a problem getting something to eat the prices were a little expensive but we were on holiday and didn t want to carry things around with us the night time parades run quite frequently people start sitting and waiting at least hours before to get a good spot so make sure you get there early loved the parade lots of lights parade floats and great dancers transport wise most people come by car we were staying near hollywood so we got an uber to disney it took about an hour and cost about each way we felt this was reasonable ,5,2017-02-11
5643,I will ALWAYS go to Disneyland in the winter!!,sunny mid s and either a fast pass or lines shorter than minutes you can t beat that i will never go to disneyland during the busy season it just wouldn t be worth it there were no crowds few long lines and the hotels were way cheaper i can t even imagine enjoying our trip if it was hot super crowded and super long lines the kids would have just melted down and been miserable it was well worth missed days of school ,5,2017-02-11
5644,Disney in Feb,this was our nd trip to disneyland with out two children the first trip was years ago when our kids were years old in july poor decision it was super hot and the lines wait times were ridiculous we decided to do a disney do over now that our kids are years old we thought this would be a more reasonable age for them to go and enjoy all that is disney we opted to go in february this time thinking it would be far less hot and far less people the temperature was definitely better although apparently it rains far more than californians let on no biggie we are from victoria so a little rain is just a regular day for us the lines were decent without ridiculous line ups like we had experienced when visiting in the summer our only gripe was the amount of times rides broke down omg we went on the haunted mansion times and it broke down every single time space mountain broke down twice alice in wonderland ride was closed for basically days big thunder mountain broke down mad hatter tea cups was closed not scheduled refurbs maybe we just had bad luck as it seemed like every time we headed for a ride it was either broken down and closed or broke down while we were on it also pirates of the caribbean was closed the entire days for refurbishments and matterhorn bobsleds was closed for refurb on day for the remainder of our days we were aware of this prior to visiting but it still sucked we were there friday tuesday and friday night saturday and sunday were extremely busy summertime busy but friday during the day monday and tuesday were amazing with barely any wait times we had magic morning which we took advantage of only good for thursdays saturdays and tuesdays on the tuesday our last day and were shocked to learn the magic morning is only good for rides in tomorrowland fantasyland silly us we thought it was good for the whole park and we tried to head for indiana jones the park is definitely overpriced in my opinion our day park hopper tickets were like usd which seems pretty out of reach for the average family overall visiting disney in february was great for less people shorter lines wait times and mild temperatures but not the best for having the fun rides all operating and seemed a lot broke down this visit and the ticket cost is the same ,3,2017-02-11
5645,Original park,i prefer this place to any other disneyland as it is the original the park is not very big and full of rides and attractions you don t have to walk too far as in the magic kingdom in disney world the line wasn t too bad as in tokyo disneyland this is my favorite disneyland of all ,5,2017-02-11
5646,Expensive but nice,the disneyland is nice but the ticket prices are awful nowadays place is really crowded so it s better to go early and take the best rides and sites first ,5,2017-02-10
5647,Disney trip,this was my wife s th time and she still enjoyed every bit she said most of the rides were the same but the show frozen was new and awesome if i had the chance to see it again i would ,5,2017-02-10
5648,Dreams come true!,everything i could dream and more the park is small compared to disney world but so much is packed into the small space mickey s magical map is a must see the matterhorn bobsleds were a top choice as well ,5,2017-02-10
5649,I mean.. It is Disney After all,it is going to be impressive no doubt i think everyone should at least go once however if given a choice i think you should go here before disney world if it is the other way around disneyland seems a lot less impressive ,4,2017-02-10
5650,Happiest place in Calafornia,we had a day at disneyland and the lineups were short and the weather held most rides we were min on and off ,5,2017-02-10
5651,Always a joy to go!,all life s worries disappear when i go here i cannot wait to go back later this year for our yearly trip ,5,2017-02-10
5652,Overpriced and overcrowded,spent over usd for a family of with day pass at dis cal land in late january crowds were epic worst i have experienced anywhere in the world making each day at least two of their prized blue ribbon rides were closed for maintenance which upon re opening had lines up to hours long fast passes got us onto them all with a hour max wait such waits though really are excessive why can t the park limit maximum crowd number why can t families with young kids buy an early entry from am like in house guests keeping track of young kids in the crowds is most stressful with park diners offering overpriced poor food that did little to help relax there why can t disney service all rides each night to minimise risk of failing during opening hours run a ski resort like this and they would fail miserably ,2,2017-02-09
5653,Fun,i love disney california s park was the first of all so it s nice visiting it it is way smaller than orlando s it has parks that can be done in a day choosing the attractions wisely it s better to stay one night so as to visit it at your own pace ,5,2017-02-09
5654,Smaller -and more enjoyable- than Orlando,this is disney what else can you say it has been a long time since i was here opting to go to orlando i remember it being smaller it is smaller than orlando but it feels well organized were there mid week late january single day tickets to the park on tuesdays are cheaper so the lines were fast only ride were i spent more than minutes was at finding nemo which is a slow ride and not found in orlando used to be leagues same submarine concept but now with the nemo characters we decided only to do the disneyland park but if you want to add california adventure it is literally right in front for the orlando regulars it is a weird feeling to have two disney parks so close by in my opinion la anaheim have much more to offer than orlando as a city so if you want to do more things than just parks this is a good option if you are in an only parks kind or trip then go to orlando ,5,2017-02-09
5655,Fun day,happiest place on earth we had a great day fast pass system is great you feel like a special person when you go to the head of the line without needing to pay extra for a vip pass brilliant system ,5,2017-02-09
5656,Love Disneyland,what can be more magical than a day at disneyland we loved a small small world and pirates of the carribean the day and evening parades were lovely and the fireworks display spectacular ,5,2017-02-09
5657,40th Birthday!,had to get park hopper tickets and enjoy disneyland for my th birthday the lines weren t bad at all and we got to go on everything even had lunch at the blue bayou it was a fabulous day if the fireworks are a must for you check the schedule first they didn t have them the day we were there ,5,2017-02-08
5658,Love Disneyland!,absolutely love a trip to disney rain or shine my kids and i really enjoy our annual disneyland trip no complaints just fun ,5,2017-02-08
5659,My favorite place on earth,no matter what time of year you go disneyland is always a magical experience amazing adventures for all ages we were there in august with our children two year old and two year olds this was the first major vacation with step siblings this place bonded our kids like no other trip could of thank you disneyland for bringing my family together ,5,2017-02-08
5660,First visit!,wonderful experience for all first timers from the east coast we are a family of disney geeks having been to disney world many times had a great time experiencing both parks nice imagining walt walking around here ,5,2017-02-08
5661,"Fun times, short lines",we are from orlando and used to long theme park lines even though the park was busy we never waited longer than minutes it s disneyland what else to say ,5,2017-02-08
5662,Disneyland is really the happiest place,this was the most wonderful experience i am now a disney fan for life i will return as often as we can our kids had so much fun and the are almost they where able to do so much and they where free since they aren t yet thanks for making it so fun disneyland cast every one was so friendly and helpful ,5,2017-02-08
5663,Well who doesn't love Disneyland,a bit of rain in the morning turned out to be a blessing for us shortening the queues and making the experience much more fun we loved all the rides and took advantage of the express queue system it works the food is a bit on the average side and not cheap but that s what you expect at a theme park isn t it sadly the fireworks were cancelled due to wind condition but the parade was still spectacular ,5,2017-02-07
5664,Great trip,we went to disneyland on february nd i love coming the beginning of february in the middle of the week there are the least amount of crowds we did the early magic hour and we were able to go on rides and buy a mickey ears hat and have it embroidered in the first hour definitely take advantage of the baby centers to change diapers there are several baby changing stations and very convenient also it is a good idea to bring a bright colored diaper bag to attach to your stroller to make it stand out in the sea of black strollers ,5,2017-02-07
5665,PhotoPass Claiming Process Very Poor,i purchased a disney generated photo of my ride down the splash mountain chute the credit card sized photopass receipt disney provided had an online address on the back where i was supposed to enter a code and claim my photo as a downloadable file when entered the online address automatically shunted me to a web page where i had to enter a password since i did not have a password i had to create an account to get a password even though i had already paid for my photo i had to enter personal information and ensure that a new password of my own selection met stringent security requirements i guess the alpha numeric case sensitive code that was printed on my receipt card was not adequate to complete this process i spent minutes on the phone with several very polite disney employees who led me through different web pages and the general process my selected passwords never did work in their system and a disney staff member had to email me a copy of the photo unfortunately disney does not compensate callers for any long distance charges they incur while trying to navigate through disney s wonderful world of data collection the splash mountain ride itself was memorable but definitely skip the disney photo unfortunately because of the way the ride is constructed a family member at the bottom will not have a chance to take your photo as you travel down the chute you ll just have to rely on your memory ,1,2017-02-07
5666,Our favorite destination of the year,loved it would ve loved it even more if there weren t so many rides breaking down at one point hyperspace mountain thunder mountain and the indiana jones ride were all shut down which caused extremely long lines to build for rides that usually aren t an issue pirates of the caribbean was closed that week too so it was tough trying to get our money s worth that day on rides anyway had to wait minutes for the haunted mansion ride because of all the closures pretty unheard of during the first week of may but it happens ,5,2017-02-07
5667,Wonderful Day at Park on Daughter's 5th Birthday,went to park during extra hour before park opens to general public lined up well in advance went right to peter pan ride managed to go through half of park and see all characters photos autographs for year old within about hour trip download app as shows where characters are and ride times in real time used fast pass for space mountain and indiana jones rides ,5,2017-02-07
5668,Disneyline,the majority of the day is spent in line mins in line for a min ride every thing is really expensive so bring a lot of cash ,1,2017-02-07
5670,"Always Fun, always Clean, always CROWDED!",this was my first time at disneyland having been to disney world a number of times positive experience all the fun with fewer steps between each as always at disney clean with pleasant people manning the rides and walking the streets we went at the end of january great time to go to avoid the horrible crowds and endless lines it s fun and both kid and handicapped friendly we spent one day at disney and one at the california experience park fun but enough time in each definitely worth visiting if you re in the area ,5,2017-02-06
5671,A Favorite Experience,unfortunately they have continued to disappoint us disneyland of years ago is not today they need to backtrack not let people pay for passes on time not take little perks away like blocking areas from fireworks many other items too numerous to list still love our dland passholders years,5,2017-02-06
5672,The Happiest Place on Earth,i love disneyland they get so many things so right lunch at the blue bayou was delicious and fun the main street electrical parade was terrific and nostalgic and the dole whip was just a good as i remembered it i was there with my year old mother and my two daughters ages and and we all loved the princess story time with belle with the help of the disneyland app we met many characters and with the help of the app and fastpasses we never waited longer than minutes for any ride even so the park felt crowded i think the construction is partially to blame with the closure of the river and all its attractions plus high volume rides it s a small world and the jungle cruise were both closed in our one day we didn t manage to do everything but we did all our favorite things ,4,2017-02-06
5673,Crowded,ok here we go went with the family for days in july i had to rent a scooter due to injury to my back and i was worried if i could even handle going day was not too bad but we left very early due to my health day was very busy and we spent most of it in the other park day we decided to watch the fireworks and the electric lights parade and we found a spot early off to one side this is where the biggest problem began during the parade a family crowded into my space even placing their young child on the back of my scooter when i protested the lady started giving me attitude then her husband joined in any ways at the end of the parade they moved away with a few more comments we stayed in the area for the fireworks the same family pushed their way in front of me and completely blocked my view this time there was words exchanged and he accuitly threw a punch at me disney really has to address the problems with viewing areas for those in wheelchairs and those people that are handicapped the park we have been several times in the past always for several days at a time this time i have to say was not enjoyed by me for several reasons it is starting to really show its age and several rides and attractions were closed i really believe this is the last time i will going to me it is just not worth the money or aggravation ,3,2017-07-19
5674,Disneyworld versus Disneyland,if you have never been to disneyworld then disneyland would be a wonderful place to visit having been to disneyworld several times it just isn t as magical granted we still enjoyed ourselves but the park seems much smaller highly recommend if you ve never been to a disney themepark but otherwise you may want to re consider if you do go i recommend the fastpass and to eat at the carnation caf for dinner try the meatloaf ,3,2017-07-19
5675,What a wonderful 2 days!,top notch service and great rides this is pure disney magic our only complaint is that the nightime crowds can get overwhelming but then again while everyone watches the fireworks rides have almost no wait at all i m planning on going again ,5,2017-07-18
5676,It's a small CROWDED world,fun but hot and very crowded very long waits for rides got stuck on a ride for an hour staff was rude to their stranded visitors barking commands we were promised water that never came they gave us a couple of fast passes to rides we had no interest in loved the rides we were able to go on ,3,2017-07-18
5677,Loved it! But....,we were very disappointed to not have wifi as an international traveller we need wifi to communicate with each other or to access disney app we were surprised because seaworld san diego zoo universal studios all have free wifi another huge disappointment for us was the character lines our daughters stood in line for sometime mins only to watch the character leave before we had a chance to take a picture unfortunately this happened to us a or times we started to ask the character guide what the schedule was there should be someone at the end telling people when they are leaving ,3,2017-07-18
5678,Round 1 of the day...,disney was a great time i had only been to fl so i was looking forward to seeing the differences this park had the same feel as fl but was smaller and more compact in my opinion my family had a great time on the new rides as well as the old favorites like the haunted mansion and pirates how could you go wrong with disney it s the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-07-17
5679,Magical place! Not as good as Disney World.,very magical and all the exciting and fun things to do for all ages and for the whole family absolutely fantastic memories some of the rides were old in the original disneyland yet very enjoyable nothing short of spectacular ,5,2017-07-17
5680,Disneyland One Day Park Hopper is Plenty,this was our first trip to disneyland after many years we have been to disney world which is obviously a much larger park you can easily go to magic kingdom and california adventure in one day use a park hopper ticket to go back and forth during the day best rides cars in california adventure so much fun put your family in the same vehicle the grand canyon look alike layout is the best disney has done but equal to the harry potter area in magic kingdom the harry potter ride alpine bobsled thunder mountain and space mountain are so worth it what was not so great is the fast pass time structure this pass available for most rides allows you to skip the min to min line for some rides but you have to space the fast passes hours apart or else it won t let you get the next one until time has elapsed the waits for the popular rides can be horrendous that was the worst part especially on a hot day outdoor sprinkler fans were scarce here as compared to universal studios overall a good day but disney needs a better handle on wait times and ways to reduce them ,4,2017-07-17
5681,Always fun!,have a season pass and have been many times always looking for new things to do and never disappointed ,4,2017-07-16
5682,Makes Orlando Park feel like a fake handbag from Canal Street,i m from the east coast after trips in my lifetime to disney world in orlando i went to disneyland in anaheim for the first time and i am hooked you cannot beat the original if they get magic bands which doesn t seem likely due to archaic infrastructure it might be darn near perfect you can feel walt s personal touches that created this park he was never part of anything in the florida parks as they were just being conceived at the time of his death disneyland was incredibly charming and it was a joy to see mary blair s original it s a small world artwork and also the original haunted mansion where you enter through the front door on the porch orleans square was so pretty too one thing florida does better is accommodate those waiting on long lines with entertainment during the waiting and more a c california was hot hot hot in the afternoon and the rides broke down a few times we had to skip matterhorn because it was broken almost the whole day ,5,2017-07-16
5683,HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH,don t go to los angeles without going to disney land or the adventure park it is a must do even for adults,5,2017-07-16
5684,First trip to Disneyland,before this trip i d heard from families who visit disneyland every year or every other year and i thought to myself why we live in washington state and i thought there are hundreds of places i would rather visit than an amusement park designed to further promote one company s movies music merchandise and overall brand after two days in the park with my husband and two children ages and i may be a convert i can see how you keep coming back it s impossible to see everything you want to see in one trip yet everything is close enough together that you can do a lot in one day the experience from am to pm for us is truly magical we will definitely be back and i can t believe i m saying that ,5,2017-07-16
5685,Another magical visit to Disneyland and California Adventure,another great family trip to disneyland and california adventure we spent days between the two parks and the wait times and crowds were not an issue throughout our visit which was a concern with a mid summer visit the addition of fast passes on toy story midway mania the matterhorn and others was a welcome addition and with some planning and usage of the disneyland app helps avoid long waits in line at many attractions the main street electrical parade was great as was world of color and the projections during the fireworks in front of the island where fantasmic were signifincantly clearer and improved from past visits excited for the return of fantasmic at our next visit if additional changes are of similar quality as the projections the customer service presentation cleanliness and overall experience continues to be excellent and a magical experience for young and old love that you can still bring snacks etc from outside the park which helps in the lines and to keep down some of the food costs as that can get expensive if buying everything in the park one negative is that admission prices continue to climb annually and have nearly doubled in the past years wish there was a better annual pass price structure for non southern california resident looking forward to our next visit though to the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-07-16
5686,3 day visit,we spent three days at both parks we found dinseyland more tightly packed in than ca park there seemed to be less shade for those queuing in line for rides and the paths were narrower than at ca park loved splash mountain and the materhorn bobsleds kids loved autotopia and the nemo ride staff were great and park was clean overall you can tell that this park is a lot older i think we ate way to many mickey ice creams our third day we had a hopper pass so did the rides again we really liked and stayed for the night parade and fireworks show both parks well worth the money for a once in a lifetime visit as a family if visiting with small kids book a hotel nearby and use a free shuttle service this meant we could go back to the hotel in the afternoon for a rest and return later on for the night activities ,5,2017-07-15
5687,Be prepared for extreme heat,the park is not as good about creating shade as california adventure get the unofficial guide and follow the touring plan for an easy stress free visit ,4,2017-07-15
5688,First Time Disney Experience,i have to say as an adult who had never been to anything disney before this was an amazing experience i made sure to hit all the classic rides like the tea cups dumbo and small world i had a blast but i don t care for fast and scary rides at all so the rest of my group enjoyed the matterhorn we made sure to get a dole whip float it was worth the and the wait in line on a hot summer day we had to laugh when we took the jungle cruise as it is just like the wisconsin ducks ride in wisconsin dells same snarky one liners from the tour guide just exotic animals instead of the wildlife in wisconsin we enjoyed it though like we were home for a few minutes on our trip ,4,2017-07-15
5689,Can't go wrong with a Disney Park - fun for all ages,my two s sons and i had a one day one park pass to dl in april on a monday value day cost each we have been to wdw several times but this was only our second visit to dl we were a bit disappointed for us disneyland did not exude the same magical feel we usually feel visiting a disney park i think that one reason may be the lack of disney characters roaming around other than the parades and standing in very long lines for a photo and autograph session you can go the entire day without seeing a live character of course dl is still disney and is a wonderful amusement park the park is spotless and the layout easy to navigate dl has a few rides that are unique to the park for example the matterhorn we were thrilled to discover that the update had been completed and we were able to ride it the app that allows you to see the wait times for rides was invaluable and allowed us determine which rides we wanted to go and what wait to expect also we utilized the fast pass system throughout the day and in fact went on all the more adventurous lines using passes ex space mountain splash mountain matterhorn and star tours there is a frozen treat in frontier adventureland area using dole pineapple slush that we love from prior visits we wanted to buy some and walked over several times that day but the line was extremely long so we didn t wait at night one last attempt we discovered to our delight that on the back side of the stand there was no wait another item to note is that there can be a long wait getting into the park anytime near opening unless you are coming from an on site hotel everyone going to dl california adventure and the downtown disney all have to walk down the same roadway no matter if you have a bag or not you must go through the bag check else you look like you are cutting the line then you get into another line to enter the park of your choice both move pretty quickly but be prepared for a very large crowd and either go a half hour or more early to be at the beginning of the line or expect a lengthy wait ,4,2017-07-14
5690,Disneyland Fun!,who doesnt love all things disney second time here and it was so much fun i went with my year old daughter and her best friend before they leave for college and we just had a blast if you are smart about using fast pass you will get on all your favorite rides ,5,2017-07-14
5691,Hmmmm,we always love disneyland but this time we re saying it s time to upgrade the tomorrowland area is so outdated ,3,2017-07-13
5692,Happiness,who doesn t love disneyland it was a bit crowded compared to other months of the year that we typically visit i wouldn t go back the st week of june but always an amazing time in disneyland ,5,2017-07-13
5693,Yay Disney!!!,i hadn t been to disneyland in probably years before this trip so it was like my first time all over again it s disney magic at its best so refreshing after all the times i ve been to dw in florida already planning my trip back in two years much better access to characters than at dw and a lot more original rides ,5,2017-07-12
5694,"A must visit, iconic park",if you ve never been to disneyland you must go this is the place that walt so lovingly created even though much has changed since his time pros the limited time return of the main street electrical parade pirates of the caribbean and mr toad s wild ride cons long lines and being directed by cast members like cattle through a chute at parade fireworks times my son called disneyland the bossiest place on earth after getting caught up in the park s crowd control between the early parade and fireworks we visited with an elderly woman who has trouble standing walking so we rented her an ecv for our stay onsite deckert was wonderful to rent from she was able to ride many rides with either a short wait or scheduled return time kind of like fastpass which was helpful with her lesser stamina cast members were extremely helpful with getting her onto rides especially the man who helped us in fantasyland at both the alice and peter pan rides i wish we had gotten his name to properly thank him for his kindness we didn t get to ride as many rides as we would have liked due to various things but we had a blast at disneyland and can t wait to return in the future ,4,2017-07-12
5695,Fours years after,it has been years since my last visit line up better than i thought my kids favour the thunder mountain ride and did three times hoping disneyland has misting fans cooling off area like universal s studio cause it s super hot especially when you are bringing your kids there waiting at line ,5,2017-07-11
5696,A Dream Destination,our fourth visit to disneyland and our family still feels the same magic and enjoy the rides every time we love coming here and every family if they have a chance should come ,5,2017-07-11
5697,A Day to Remember,having grown up in south fl disneyworld was our natural go to destination even when my own kids were growing up in ga but having the opportunity to visit family in la and combine it with a day in disneyland with my now grown daughter a granddaughter and their friends on a memorable girlstrip was super fun more compact than its fl counterpart but missing epcot jammed on the week of july th but delighted to have fast track and splurged on concierge service for the benefits of both or we d have died waiting the lines were brutal and the heat oppressive ,5,2017-07-10
5698,Its Disney,come on its disneyland the happiest place on earth what more do you want not sure which is more fun the rides and entertainment or the people watching parking is okay but you d be better off parking a few miles away and taking an uber in its disney have fun ,5,2017-07-08
5699,Got 12 rides on a day - thanks fast pass. Colorful fireworks for july 4th,we went here with a yr old and a yr old and spent a whole tiring day we started on tommorrow land and ended in adventureland the rides we enjoyed the most were indiana jones splash mountain ft drop without a seat belt on water crazy space mountain matterhorn mountain railroad family rides pirates of the carribean haunted mansion its a small world gadget go coaster is an intro coaster for a smaller kid on the ride back we kept kids busy by recollecting and scoring the rides tiki house and autopia were not so popular for our group but it gave us rest on a hot day quick cafe lunches in the resort was low quality except for lobster roll near mark twain boat fireworks are best viewed from main street but we got a good view from near the lake get fast pass for rides that allow if for free you can get one for each ride but only one at a time the fireworks start around pm and kids are exhausted parking is about miles away and uber is a better option than paying for the bus which was per person compared with an overall for uber the disney land queues were way better than the adventureland queues wait timea just be prepared for a crazy crowd after the fireworks feels like s of folks walking out at the same time someone mentioned that you could see the fireworks outside the main entrance and avoid the crowds ,3,2017-07-06
5700,Still the happiest place on earth,who doesn t love disneyland the rides the character s and the shows are all awesome the best piece of advise i can give is avoid spending hours queuing to meet characters arrange a disney breakfast at somewhere like goody s kitchen where the characters come to you giving you more time for rides and shows at disneyland also be sure to use the fast passes and if your there more than one day only watch the evening parade once the other nite head to the rides as this is when they are quietest p s jedi training is awesome for kids up to ,5,2017-07-06
5701,To the land where childhood comes to life !!!,disneyland park is a dream a magic land which transports you to another world away from the mundane worries of adult life what a day these tips should glide you through your day at disneyland if day single park is what you have opted aim to reach the parking gate mickey friends parking by am about mins before the gate to magicland opens we reached at and were behind half the people on earth once the car is parked it takes at least mins to cross the beast of a parking structure take the elevator if you have strollers and queue up for the tram although the trams are super frequent you are in a comfortable position if you reach the main gate get into the ticket check bag search queue as early as it gets the california sun also gets harsher as day progresses once all done welcome to the land where everybody is a child i am a mother of a year old but that didn t deter me from squealing on spotting mickey posing for photos try to get the disney photographers click as many as they can they scan link the photo pass to your app pay download later if you like the shots we saw them stationed mostly near mickey minnie near the castle royal hall with the princesses and emporium on main street we clicked pictures with mickey right at the start of the day avoided toonhouse altogether it saves a lot of time as mickey toonhouse is at one end of the park pretty much has nothing great except their houses on display now would be a good idea to get a light snack drink from a main street eatery and thereafter head straight to fantasyland do peter pan s flight first although the app says mins wait time it happens quicker the ride is about mins duration we finished alice in wonderland storybook land canal boats and its a small world in quick succession without much wait in between we managed to click pictures with the evil witch from snow white chip n dale woody and pinocchio gepatto by now it was almost noon the glaring sun suck out a lot of energy get some lunch rest your feet for a while try the flatbread poutine from red rose tavern its damn good on satiating hungry tummies hubby headed to splash mountain while kiddo i did some winnie the pooh spotting single rider pass is a gift from god for rides which have perennial absurd wait times he was back in about minutes at pm all thanks to single rider option while engrossed in a debate whether to skip enchanted tiki room rapunzel just outside the royal hall caught my attention kiddo was thankfully over out in his stroller by then so daddy cherished this peaceful stop i met cinderella snow white sleeping beauty rapunzel totally smitten overwhelmed storybooks came to life there i was tired and the sun was gnawing at every bit of energy so kiddo i walked back for an afternoon nap to the hotel hubby got the car out from mickey parking lot parked at the hotel instead to avoid hassles at night when the entire crowd will once again assemble at the parking structure best decision a quick nap fresh set of clothes later we were on way back for the second half of the day started with jungle cruise which had about mins of wait time the narrative was hilarious and enjoyable hubby did the space mountain with single rider while i did some window shopping and snacked along with kiddo with all rides done under our checklist it was time to reserve a spot for the fireworks scheduled at so we camped right in front of the castle at around for a great spot i cannot put in words the visual treat disney fireworks are it was dazzling and brilliant hours wait was worth for such a spot right after the fireworks we headed to the plaza inn for dinner and it was decently full we did not have prior reservation but were seated immediately on arrival plaza is the most renowned fine dine at disney district after a quick dinner we once again camped by the pavement on main street for the electrical parade its an absolute must watch this is what completes the disney experience stunning and just wow our last stop for the day was emporium at main street for collectibles and souvenirs to forever etch this day in our hearts for the many more years to come got some photos clicked at midnight too by their photographer disneyland is expensive yes so try to live and enjoy the experience rather than counting the number of rides done plan days before in advance the rides you want to do and time it on the app around the time you expect yourself browse the internet and gather day itineraries for a fantastic day at this magical land ,5,2017-07-06
5702,The happiest place on earth,i will never grow old of disneyland it truly is the happiest place on earth stay at a disney hotel if you want the whole experience but if you re on a budget save money by staying off site and it won t take away from your trip ,5,2017-07-05
5703,5 stars but Disney World waaay better to us.,i m giving disneyland stars because hey it s disney nobody does it better the of us left feeling a little disappointed disney world just seems so much more epic compared to disneyland that it s ridiculous another advisor said it best when he said that disneyland seems like a nice amusement park with a disney theme while disney world seems like a major event disneyland sure had better weather though i m glad we went to see for ourselves ,5,2017-07-04
5704,Disneyland,this certainly is the happiest place on earth the staff are all very personable and they keep the park very clean they have a ceremony every day to retire our nation s flag and to honor all military personnel active and veterans and their families it s so awesome to take your children and grandchildren and watch them have fun it was disappointing that there weren t as many characters out interacting with the public as there has been in the past we have been annual pass holders in the past but the price increased so high that we couldn t afford to renew them unfortunately i think that the people in charge of disneyland have forgotten what walt disney originally built disneyland for he didn t build it to make money he built it for families to enjoy a wonderful and affordable time together ,5,2017-07-03
5705,Absolutely Magical!!,i first visited disneyland years ago when i was in my mid s when i was single it was expensive then and is even more expensive now disneyland is the happiest place on earth and is just absolutely magical and my dream of taking my two beautiful children to this magical place finally came true to see their eyes light up and experience this amazing place was priceless everyone young or old should experience the original disneyland in anaheim at least once in their lifetime unfortunately it has become extremely expensive and may not be affordable for many families the attractions are amazing the shows are spectacular and the whole atmosphere in the park is surreal the night time fireworks are just striking and the main st electrical parade is absolutely phenomenal don t miss these shows as they truly make the disneyland experience that extra bit special we bought the day hopper ticket which allows entry into both parks in the one day it was worth it as we could enter both parks on the same day and not miss any shows in the time frame we were there we were on the go go go from morning to night seeing as much as we could we achieved all that we wanted to but if we were to go again i would buy the or day pass as days isn t long enough to go on all the attractions see the shows as well as go through all the gorgeous little shops and stores and just chill be sure to use the fast passes to your advantage as some rides have a hour wait and you get a lot more done using the fast passes everything in disneyland is expensive food drinks souvenirs merchandise expect to pay premium price you can always leave the park and eat outside during the day but we couldn t be bothered we only ate dinner outside the park at the cheesecake factory everything just tastes so good at disneyland the cotton candy just melts in your mouth the popcorn is the best popcorn i have ever had and the icecreams are yum yum yum especially mickey s cookies n cream icecream sandwich expect to pay around usd each for these we loved every moment in disneyland with our children and to be able to experience this as a family was very special i know it s expensive but this unforgettable time we spent together is priceless god bless the man who created the happiest place on earth walt disney you are star and dreams do come true ,5,2017-07-01
5706,A magical visit,after holidaying in orlando and visiting wdw i was a little skeptical about visiting disneyland resort i m used to vast theme parks and was worried i d be let down by such a smaller park i could not have been more wrong as an adult family we decided to spend just one day at disneyland we didn t visit the second park during a weekend in california and we were not disappointed although on a smaller scale i didn t feel as though we missed out on anything had it been a bigger park i think i d have felt as though a day had not been enough we arrived in downtown disney around am and ate at la brea bakery see other review for breakfast this meal kept us going all day so definitely worth it we made the most of the day by using the disneyland app to keep a check on wait times for the rides and squeezed in snacks during the day rather than sit down for a big meal the park was busy we attended on a saturday but it was nothing compared to the orlando crowds we know so well the park was easy to navigate and it was only the flight of peter pan that took up a substantial amount of wait time however crowds did seem to massively increase in the run up to the electrical light parade i was so happy that i got to see this parade one more time because it s my absolute favourites i d definitely recommend a visit to disneyland resort but it just can t be compared to wdw it needs to be appreciated for being the original disney park ,5,2017-07-01
5707,Quintessential Disney,once the shock of the cover price wears off you ll have a great time the disney experience is always a exciting one whether it s a fist or hundredth no two visits are ever really the same at least imho on my most recent visit i took brother in law and nephew from china to what i thought was magic mountain only to find it had been converted to some sort of star wars ride pretty damn cool either way being of star wars age i really enjoyed it at that time some of the park was closed the haunted house tom sawyer s island etc closures usually happen during winter months for alternating rides which i think are communicated via the official website our visit coincided with the th anniversary so featured a spectacular fireworks show that we caught that from the plaza between disneyland and disney california adventure fireworks are common but don t run indefinitely and are a special and fantastic sight adult tickets are around for non southern california residents if you have an id with a socal address present it for the discounted rate you can probably save money on admissions and sometime get a nice package deal by shopping through your insurance provider costco or a travel broker ,4,2017-06-30
5708,Disneyland............Finally!!!!,wow what a vacation disneyland was everything what i expected i was more excited then my kids traveling with my wife and kids age and i had to make plans prior to our trip but also willing to compromise if i had too make the trip more memorable and exciting word of advice for those who are staying close to the park take a taxi cab we didn t park our vehicle or take the art shuttle we stayed at the hilton anaheim great location and the fare cost only including tip one way with people for a minivan made it back to our hotel and disneyland within minutes dinner at blue bayou was top notch we had reservation and a table by the water it was perfect food was delicious i highly recommend making a days ahead reservation the month of june s weather in anaheim was perfect like degrees and at night thank you for fastpass recommendation we went to universal studio two days later and they had double stroller for rental and cool mist fan stationed just about everywhere disney you have money why not invest in some cool mist fan for your customers especially for the children degrees was fine not complaining but it can get real hot overall in a nut shell our day disneyland trip was fantastic my kids were troopers couldn t believe we opened and closed disneyland at midnight bonus single stroller and fastpass didn t make it to adventure park next time ,5,2017-06-30
5709,Fun experience but won't return,overall we had a great visit but having already been to disneyworld this park was disappointing the overall feel wasn t the same that we are used to it wasn t dirty but wasn t super clean the rides weren t as detailed in the way you enter a ride while you wait not a lot of character experiences offered we did love indiana jones and thought space mountain here was much better am glad to say we saw the original park but will stick to orlando from now on ,3,2017-06-30
5710,The Happiest Place on Earth!,definitely deserves the title i went to disneyland for the first time last july when i was years old to be immersed in a place where i had no worries where everyone seems in a good mood where even crowds are tolerable was hugely impactful on my life it was like walking into my year old self i haven t had that kind of unadulterated joy in a long time we are planning to go back this september i save all year and will do so every year for as long as i am able disneyland is my happy place but so much more than that ,5,2017-06-28
5711,First Visit,this was or very first time at disneyland we have visited disneyworld multiple times and wanted this experience overall disneyworld is still my favorite but if you have the opportunity to experience both its something i would do taking bits and pieces from each park and combining them would be wonderful ,5,2017-06-27
5712,Enjoyable for both Adults and Children,our family had an excellent time in disneyland in all the different sections of the park the wait times for all the rides were extremely reasonable and the kids got to do all of their favorite rides numerous times i recommend going during the week because that s when we found it to be the quietest,4,2017-06-27
5713,For anyone going to Disneyland for the 1st time,just a few pointers the minute you have booked your tickets the earlier the better start looking at where you want to eat for lunch and dinner whilest this does lock you in restaurant in disneyland book up very quickly quite far in advance i brought tickets in april for june all restaurants for lunch or dinner were already booked make sure you have breakfast as other than starbucks there is nothing in disney direct open for breakfast if you have purchased a day ticket use your magic morning to visit california adventure once your in go get your fast passes straight away splash mountain is what it says it is you will get wet soaked even especially if you are in the front seat so either take a poncho or don t go on the ride waiting times for some rides can be annoying so any time you see a fast pass available get it if you are waiting in line be prepared for people to skip past you to meet there family friends who are further up the line this happens alot and you just need to be patience enjoy the magic because regards of how old you are disneyland is truly a magically place ,5,2017-06-27
5714,Magical,how can it not be a crowded but manageable hot but doable fast passes worked well went to dl and dca still magical and fun ,5,2017-06-26
5715,Its Disney at it's Best,having been to disneyland multiple times i have said this place was built for kids young and old i think the older ones have as much if not more fun than the little ones even though things change many of the original rides still exist and my family had as much fun on them as they did the newer ones lines were long but use the fast pass option for the bigger rides future rides are being built food in the park is pricey but what do you expect they do allow you to carry in food water is a good option the cast workers are all well trained and friendly get the disneyland app it helps with wait times and navigating around this place is indeed the happiest place on earth,5,2017-06-26
5716,Couples trip,this was our first time without the kids we went on so many rides yes even the kiddie ones most rides had quite a wait bear mountain had a minute wait upgrade to a fast past it helps so you don t have to wait in those long lines bring your own water you can refill it from the fountains throughout the park bottle of water there is ,4,2017-06-26
5717,Gridlock in happiness,super weather a sunday in summer and we had gridlock in town of happiness we made a big mistake of going to the park at thinking we could visit a cafe and enjoy a big breakfast with the family mins after hopping between parks stopping at every decent restaurant and being told sorry we re full tried booking online over the last weeks without success we ended up in downtown disney restaurant having lunch there were people everywhere lines longer than the eye could see the fast pass line on splash mountain at mins at pm mins to buy a pineapple ice cream haunted house line closed next time we will think more about going fully fed taking our own food and a different time of the year oh and taking our own water as the on tap options didn t taste any good ,3,2017-06-25
5718,"Wonderful, it's Disneyland",don t be in a rush enjoy every second make the most while you are there no time for angry or impatient people,5,2017-06-25
5719,Disney Park Family Vacation,what s not to like at the disneyland park we spent one day at california adventure and three days at disneyland resort our favourite it s not necessary to get the park hopper pass if one plans their agenda in advance we do recommend the disney photopass though even if you intend to take your own photos ,5,2017-06-24
5720,Much is Closed -- Best to Wait Until 2018....,disneyland has its charm but it is disappointing to be charged full price when large swaths of the park are not operating properly the park experienced multiple ride malfunctions during our stay which on one day affected every fast pass we had on all days these glitches shutdowns which spanned every major attraction that was opened created unusually long lines which resulted in fast pass holders having to wait an hour or more in addition fantasmic remains closed this was a major disappointment as between the fireworks show and fantasmic the latter is the better show the lagoon has been refilled or at least it appears to be and the two boats are sailing again but construction continues in the back areas which appears to affect the logistics of the show i m told by cast members that the area under development is about acres in size and will host a new themed area of the park while it should be wonderful when it opens it adversely affects a number of attractions now lastly both the monorail and the train are closed so for those with mobility issues including two in our party one may have to walk the length of downtown disney just to get to the park and then find there is no functioning transportation within the park this was a significant inconvenience but the monorail should be back very shortly if not tomorrow the train within the park will be longer in returning ,3,2017-06-23
5721,Stil a family favourite,for over years disneyland has delighted children and adults alike and it still has the magic good rides and live entertainment it s a shame that disney cannot sort out their dreadful food it s expensive and frankly awful ,4,2017-06-21
5722,Family fun,take your time get your fast passes at the beginning of the day of the ride you want the most then enjoy your time while waiting on your fp times they give free water,5,2017-06-20
5723,Had great time during our visit,this park is my favorite too bad some of the rides for renovation are still closed while our visit in may loved autopia submarine dumbo tea cup rides with my kids fond memories in toontown overall highly recommend spend a least two days to walk all the park ,4,2017-06-20
5724,Great day for the entire family!,there is so much to do here things to do for the entire family we had a year old with us and everyone had a blast plan your day out the best you can by using as many fast passes as possible to save more time try not to eat during peak hours as expected food at disney is pricey we will definitely be returning the bus system was spot on very organized and quick ,5,2017-06-20
5725,Great for family,st time at disneyland for all of us beautiful place for the kids have rides for toddlers as well magical experience ,5,2017-06-20
5726,Happiest place on earth,always love our vacations to disney it is crowded especially in the afternoons but bearable food is great park is always clean cast members are always nice and helpful love ,5,2017-06-18
5727,Magical 16th Birthday at Disneyland,what better way to spend a birthday we started our day with minnie friends breakfast in the park food was great and plenty of it with so many disney characters my daughter was given a birthday badge so everyone kept saying happy birthday which she loved we managed a few rides with the fast pass our fav startours space mountain pirates of the caribbean big thunder mountain so many things to see and do the pineapple dole whip is a must and so are the mickey ears truely a magical day one my daughter has thanked me for and has said she will never forget her th birthday and must do for any age ,5,2017-06-18
5728,2 days at Disneyland Paris,i ve just returned from a day trip to disneyland paris accompanied by my son who has autism i should start by saying that the trip was solely for his benefit as it s not what i d have chosen for myself looking at it from his perspective he s but a young it was a wonderful experience i want to sincerely praise the staff who couldn t have been more helpful and friendly my son had a special pass to avoid the long queues this made a huge difference to our experience because we genuinely couldn t have faced and minute waiting times which were typical while i found it weird to be in france and feel like i was in the usa my son loved it all he wasn t keen to do the more heart stopping rides but was thrilled with the star wars experience the teacups dumbo and lots more both pirates of the caribbean and small world were closed much to his disappointment the highlight on day one was without a doubt the parade of the characters on main street watching everybody s reaction to this it was clear he wasn t alone on day we went to the walt disney studios i actually preferred this part of disneyland and my son was in his element especially with the big star wars presentation the tram tour and the mickey s animagic show which is really impressive at his insistence we returned to the park for the parade our accommodation was at the santa fe one of the disney hotels while it was clean adequate and efficiently run i have to say it is one of the most soulless looking places i ve ever stayed the attempt at looking like some terracotta mex tex building has sadly resulted in a giant concrete block of ugliness inside it does what it has to do feed and house vast numbers as efficiently as possible but without any charm whatsoever i wouldn t go back although its proximity to the park was very useful and my son was quite taken by the cars theme that is clumsily pasted on to the route theme that is equally clumsily pasted on to the faux santa fe location all in all i m delighted to have shared the experience with my son and he d certainly rate it out of as for me i knew what i was getting in to and was pleasantly surprised indeed delighted by the park and the studios it s a good thing to do once and a very good thing to experience through the eyes of someone who truly finds it magical ,4,2017-06-16
5729,Very upsetting,i took me forty years to get back to disney to come back to of the majors rides being down really after i pay all that money i had to leave so disappointed i drove hour for this ,2,2017-06-15
5730,It's ok,we came from orlando and for us magic kingdom is so much better that being said it was nice to see where everything started ,4,2017-06-15
5731,Our favorite place!,the only complaint about disneyland is the parking garage it takes forever to get in in the morning then the security check to get on the trams is ridiculously crazy we walked to downtown disney and went through a three minute security line we love disney and the cms are always friendly ,5,2017-06-14
5732,The good old magic is still here,been here for the second time but still enjoyed the place with some additions and new rides the place is still amazing and a must see visit in california the atmosphere is retained and the night parade and fireworks still awesome ,5,2017-06-14
5733,Disappointed with long wait times and attractions not working,the wait times are just getting too long even with fast pass space mountain had a hr return time most rides were well over an hr the sheer volume of people made it difficult to move around the park at anything faster than a snails pace the biggeset ways of moving people were all not functioning monorail railroad mark twain columbia ship huck finn ride all not working they are getting ready for summer the parades however were magical and so worth the long waiting time to secure a good vantage point ,3,2017-06-13
5734,Great first visit to the original Disneyland,have been to paris and the magic kingdom at disney world but this park has a magic all of its own and it s own rides finding memo submarine ride the matterhorn plus all well known ones the park is under going major reconstruction but it is still plenty to see and ride on and with afternoon parade and two chances to see the main street electrical parade at night it is good value recommend,5,2017-06-13
5735,Amazing!,what can i say it s disneyland of course it s amazing the place where dreams come true and everyone believes in fairytales ,5,2017-06-13
5736,Magical Days,lets start with saying we are from orlando fl and everyone thought we are crazy to go to disneyland on our vacations obviously we wanted to compare but honestly each park is special and uniquely beautiful in their on way i personally liked disney california adventure park the most the cars land area is amazing we went right on time to ride the new galaxies of the guardians ride and we loved it the weather was a lot better than orlando and the time in lines were not to bad not as bad as disney world disneyland still does not have the electronic fast pass and that helps control the lines the most we waited was minutes and used fast passes i really enjoyed coming to disneyland actually no regrets in traveling from disney world to disneyland ,5,2017-06-12
5737,Magical in every way!,great family experience for our family we are star wars fans and loved tomorrowland my boys took part in jedi training and met darth vadar we had light saber churros and rode space mountain and star tours many times only gave stars because i hate crowds and disneyland has many you can t see disneyland in a day so have a plan and use your fast passes wisely ,4,2017-06-11
5738,Amazing Disneyland but take advantage of cheap eats right outside!,disneyland is everything you expect it to be and takes you back to a time where anything was believable and its fantastic to watch the kids get memorised by the magic of disney the food inside disney is not great and pricey so take advantage of the value option right outside the gates on s harbor blvd where you have dennys ihop maccas and other low cost eating options ,5,2017-06-11
5739,Great vacation,kids had a blast truly a great clean park with lots to see and do only complaint was some of the rides were so long otherwise would definitely come back ,5,2017-06-11
5740,"Loved it, just lots of waiting",disneyland was awesome really loved it the only downside was the long waits in the lines though the let down but through using the disneyland app was good for helping let you know how long waits would be in advance though truly was a fantastic day ,5,2017-06-10
5741,It's great and needs to be enjoyed for what it is.,we have been to disneyland now some six times over years four in the last years it still holds that childhood magic to us there are the classic rides like the jingle cruise and haunted mansion there are the timeless characters mickey minnie and the whole crew there are the long waits in the queues however this la time we had fastpasses and the disney app which made planning so much easier there is what used to be the dole kiosk is now the tiki juice bar still sells great pineapple floats we had signature annual passes when means unlimited access to the parks any time the pass includes all photopass digital images however there was a noticeable absent in the afternoon we only had photos from the pch grill character breakfast all of which does not change our opinion of disneyland it s great and needs to be enjoyed for what it is ,5,2017-06-10
5742,Check Ahead - Lots of Rides Closed,disneyland is always fun it has gotten a bit pricey but even so we were back for another trip we were surprised by how many attractions are closed indefinitely for the construction of the new star wars land monorail train sailing ship paddle wheel ship tom sawyer island in addition indian jones is closed for refurbishment makes for very long lines at the other attractions we will probably wait to go back until everything is finished and open again ,4,2017-06-10
5743,Had a great time!,was in la on business and my hotel was almost opposite the park so decided to go in for the evening had a great time but was surprised how much smaller it was compared to orlando which i ve frequented many times was disappointed that they didn t do a twilight ticket price for visitors like myself entering the park after pm it was still the full daily rate of ,5,2017-06-08
5744,1st Visit,my husband and i are huge disney fans we visit disney world times a year we finally took the plunge and visited disneyland for the st time i loved how you could feel walt s spirit within the park we loved seeing all the original disney rides we really loved all the unique rides and food disneyland had to offer i do have to say we were a little disappointed in the castmembers there they weren t as out going and bubbly as disney world castmembers maybe my expectations were a little high for this considering it was here that walt built his empire that being said it wouldn t deter us from returning we look forward to another disneyland trip in the future ,5,2017-06-07
5745,Disney Magic never fades!,diesney magic never fades old young children toddlers love disneyland park it has everything from music rides animal kingdom and all cute characters roaming around for picture taking everyone were so happy and you feel young again so many things to see and so many rides our days not enough to all themed parks we took fast pass to have more rides but still we were not able to have it all no wonder so many tried to book for days ,5,2017-06-07
5746,Wonderful time!,i ve been to disney world in fla but i think disneyland is more personable of course it s smaller but seems intimate to where you can literally walk from disneyland to dca to downtown disney it was perfect weather when we went not to hot just right also i think we picked a great time to go because even guardians of the galaxy came out and it was memorial day weekend we took advantage of the parks that tuesday to thursday and we literally covered every ride we went one day to dca and the other two days to disneyland by the third day we were hitting attractions that we wanted to do twice the park wasn t too crowded and we hit all the major attractions before lunchtime of course we took a break after lunch to rest at our hotel before going back after dinner make use of those fastpasses and the disneyland app they came in handy be prepared to walk but it means nothing when you are having a wonderful time with family my kids and thoroughly enjoyed themselves we will definitely be back ,5,2017-06-06
5747,It is the happiest place on earth!,what struck me was how truly happy everyone was in a hour day i heard precisely one swear word there were no children screaming no pushing pulling rushing cutting lines it was as if disney sprayed a miraculous potion onto everyone during the tram ride and instantly civility reigned as a woman in mid life i never expected to enjoy the park so much the culture of disney is so persuasive that i saw everyone from cheerleaders to bikers those who are goth to those who are grandparents those with mullets and those with no hair all rocking the mouse ears maybe mouse ears are all we need to bring us together ,5,2017-06-06
5748,far to busy ..,just way too busy waiting hours in queues unless you want to spend even more money on a fast pass person to do both parks that s about for our party of without fast pass every thing is over priced but it still has a buzz ,3,2017-06-05
5749,We were a bit disappointed,we came here for my daughters first visit it seemed as though every ride we tried to go on was broken at the time and we would have to come back to it later i understand it but it was frustrating i recommend leaving during peak hours and coming back later or early morning ,3,2017-06-05
5750,Losing some of its draw,we used to come every year but we have been reducing the frequency of those visits the prices continue to climb but there is little improvement even though we went during what should be the off season here were still huge crowds it also always seems that a number of good rides are shut down each time during each of our last two visits we got stuck on a ride this time it was thunder mountain and last time it was pirates of the caribbean we have also run into staff that no longer exhibit the legendary disney customer service ,3,2017-06-04
5751,Doesn't Compare to Disney World - Disappointed,second time here and not as excited than the first time this time we parked and upgraded to preferred parking but it wasn t preferred we just parked in the same lot as others but on the first row still had to take the tram like everyone else and the lines were long don t waste your money paying for the preferred parking at the park the lines were super long in the morning and some rides were closed this park doesn t compare to disney world where i do think their cast members are a lot friendlier than disneyland i just didn t feel as welcome and the park wasn t as clean then taking the tram back to the parking garage was a mess no real definition on where the lines are it s crowded they don t have enough trams or don t run them correctly and the workers were not friendly as they kept yelling to get behind the line or they couldn t move we don t think we will return a third time ,3,2017-06-04
5752,The happiest place on earth....,wow loved everything about disneyland it was so easy to get caught up in all things disney i suddenly wanted a mickey tee or ears my young daughter was so excited we went on every ride in the park from tea cups to splash mountain to hyperspace mountain any person no matter what age will fall in love with disneyland we cannot wait until our next visit ,5,2017-06-04
5753,Wonderful,even though we re in our s it is always nice to come back we have been coming here since our daughter was young and we love the place obviously the only draw back is the wait to get on some rides but that has always been a problem if you have kids come here it really is the happiest place on earth ,4,2017-06-03
5754,Magical,will always love disneyland enjoyed star wars launch bay try to get a seat closer to the firework show wishes never saw this one as i know it was at disney world ,5,2017-06-02
5755,Great time!!,we have two kids and and we really had a great time together the little one could ride in most of the attractions it was very crowded ,5,2017-06-01
5756,Great Family Fun!!,it s disneyland how can you not enjoy it this is my second time taking my daughter who is now yrs old and we always love it she was able to ride the rides she wasn t able to when she was because of height restrictions drink lots of water wear comfortable shoes utilize the fast pass for the more popular rides and try the grey stuff it s delicious lol ,5,2017-05-31
5757,Family fun,well aside from the cost the crowds and the extra cost it was fun for the whole family typical disney ,3,2017-05-31
5758,Great fun for all the family,i really enjoyed my trip to disneyland though i probably should have gone an extra day to get more stuff in bring an empty water bottle with you to fill up inside the park at the water fountains as it can get very hot there and wear sun cream i recommend a fast pass for sure and if you want to save money there bring your own food and snacks merchandise is expensive but that was expected,4,2017-05-30
5759,Family time,who doesn t love disney we have a great time enjoying every ride taking pictures with caracters and do whatever you have to do in the happiest place on earth,5,2017-05-30
5760,Aaaa.. Disneyland.. would turn back anyday,it is a must to go and be there pitty we had only a day for it take at least two days to see all,5,2017-05-30
5761,Loved the experience!,we took a day pass and enjoyed days tremendously from am pm kids got to experience almost all the rides and didn t fuss or cry ,5,2017-05-30
5762,Enjoyable Time,i visited prior to a conference and had a great time because many of the older rides are not up to ada code they allow handicapped individuals to check in and obtain a return time similar to fastpass which was helpful to my travel partnr the reason that i gave it out of stars is that the cast member with goofy at a meet and greet disappeared so we had no one to assist with photos as the guests before us had also as a repeat visitor to wdw i didn t feel as much of the magic particularly from cast members as i typically do at wdw nevertheless disneyland is still a must see ,4,2017-05-30
5763,"Lots of fun, lots of people",i recently took my wife and small kids for our first visit to disneyland in many respects it was just what one would expect crowded loud hot and lots of waiting in lines on the other hand i was pleasantly surprised in other ways my wife was confined to an ecv electric scooter due to a broken ankle all the staff were very attentive helpful and knowledgeable about assisting someone with a physical disability we ate lunch at a cafe and it was surprisingly good though simple sandwiches and less expensive than i anticipated each the drinks purchased at the park were pricey for two waters and for a small iced tea i doubt a review on here good or bad is really going to change a person s mind about going to disneyland so i ll offer a few tips to improve the trip bring lots of water snacks sunblock etc anaheim gets very hot in the summer and being prepared makes the day much better don t push the little kids too hard mine are both under five and hours was about our max at one stretch when the littles get too fatigued the fun turns south quickly tickets with the early riser pass are great we arrived at am one morning and rode rides before the park opened to the general public download the disneyland app the map is very helpful and the real time wait estimates for rides are a must ,4,2017-05-28
5764,"Family trip to The Happiest Place on Earth... with 3 kids.. 4,5&9",what can i say how can disneyland not be magical the look in our boys face is priceless we came years ago as a family as well i ve been many times but living in the midwest makes less frequent trips sad day so keep the water flowin lots of ways around purchasing water too your going to wait in line for the bigger rides and peter pan but that s life we had day park hoppers and we were able to take it slow and enjoy everything multiple times utilize fast pass go at open and stay til close those are definitely the slowest hours a plus as always disney besides not having guardians open when we were there next time in ,5,2017-05-28
5765,Missing a bit of the Disney Magic,i had been looking forward to visiting the original disneyland for years i was ver excited for all of the unique rides to this park and the disney experience unfortunately this park didn t live up to expectations out of all the disney parks we have visited in the world this is the worst because of the age of the rides there are a high amount of breakdowns when you have been queuing almost hours to get on a ride and then it breaks down and you just have to leave with no fast pass it is super frustrating and really impacted on our enjoyment of the park this park gets incredibly busy so be prepared for minimum minute queues for rides and utilise the fast pass system the staff also do not have the disney spirit as a whole ride cast members often just ask how many and then point you at a line very little guest interaction or pleasantries the shop cast members were slightly more friendly but this was hit or miss this made the park feel more like any other theme park rather than a disney park it was very hot the final two days we spent in the park but most rides are outside queues with little shade so be prepared with sunscreen food was a fair price pretty much the same as outside the park and quite nice snacks are a little expensive but there is a lot on offer that are good so you don t mind the price a must try is the dole whip float from the tiki juice bar amazing we went for days and still missed almost half the rides and met no characters definitely could have done with an extra day or two but by the end of the three days my feet were so sore and we were a bit fed up for the crowds so anything more than three days may have been less enjoyable ,3,2017-05-27
5766,4 days are must,initially i was wondering why do they have days package but when i visited i realised why it s must it s impossible to finish everything in single day each park requires two days minimum i thought i m taking kids on weekdays and also it s not summer holidays in ca still it was super crowded wait time was mins in few of the favourite rides in disneyland park eg wars tours autopia splash mountain you have fast pass system still it s just not enough i would recommend first to visit those rides then go to other manageable rides but anyways wait time is always mins plus my family being vegetarian i had issues finding different options for food so those who fit into this category please do carry enough food with you salted and sweet both options i m sure all may not like margarita pizzas again and again also keep a track of all favourite characters of disneyland they are there near main street town square also in toon town you will catch up with winnie the pooh bear near his splash habitat it s no doubt dreams come true for me despite being a second visit it s tiresome walking walking and just walking but surely it s a must visit place ,5,2017-05-26
5767,Too any people!,too man people traveling with my parents who are in their s way too crowded not what i remember from years past ,3,2017-05-26
5768,Disneyland review,we love disneyland and have visited many times it s clean safe and organized make sure to take advantage of the fast passes for the popular rides for those visiting for the first time you may want to have breakfast with the characters we like the all you can eat breakfast the crystal palace at the end of mainstreet kids can meet winnie the pooh tigger euyore minnie donald duck captain hook rafiki fairy godmother chip and dale and a few more the characters come to each table for pictures and sometimes handshakes or hugs character dining might just be at breakfast not dinner not sure about lunchtime there are other character dining places located within the two parks which we have not been to it is somewhat costly but really worth the price ,5,2017-05-26
5769,An experience not to miss,though the price might look high usd for one park entery to choose between california adventure and disney land you will see that it is worth once inside a big park well organized where you will enjoy all the themes of disney good for kids as well as for aduslts don t miss the star wars part the d experience the space shuttle experience wonderful enjoyed also the mountain speed train use the fast track tip to avoid long queues book your priority fast track through your ticket and save time for one game at a time fireworks and street show are also amazing ,5,2017-05-25
5770,A magic experience for our children and grandchildren,what an amazing place twenty seven years since we visited with our children and they were able to bring their children aged back to share the happiness the vote from the kids is that it is the happiest place in the world ,5,2017-05-24
5771,The Original,i ll start by saying if you are a disney fan this is a must do the park is very different than disney world however very similar it s like a smaller version with some original nuances to make it unique and charming the non snack food dining is better than wdw though enjoy the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-05-24
5772,The Original Disney land,calf adventure so so not anything like the original park to avoid lines go at like to pm wait after seeing the short line attractions as after pm all tourist busses go home the rides with hours of line time are eliminated fireworks start at promptly every time point is make sure your not on a ride to truly enjoy young and old especially if its your first time note bring light jackets for after nine it gets often chilly the only bad thing about the park is the costs of food there but therlockers to the immediate left as you enter the main gate little known by most anyway good place for jackets foods although you might have to put away the food while entry into the park highly highly recommended even if you can do just one thing inso cal this is my humble recommendation ,5,2017-05-23
5773,Surprise - Captain Jack! BEST TRIP EVER!!!!!,visited the park in april and had a good time the park wasn t to busy but some lines still got long best was to go in the mornings and then know in the afternoon that it will get busy and plan accordingly fast passes food less frequented rides sit watch attractions etc then at night the park starts to empty out best time is just at closing time your rides that are close together and you can get two or three rides in the last minutes best part of our trip was the surprise visit by captain jack sparrow i still can t believe it th anniversary for the ride pirates coming out and the first ride my kids ever went on made it the best trip ever tips bring your own water drinks food can get expensive but they allow water in get some food before you enter the park and bring in your own water freeze a bottle or two as well also we save up disney dollars with the disney credit card helps pay for the trip and you also get a meet and greet with disney and star wars characters ,4,2017-05-23
5774,One day visit,travelled with my family if you are looking for adventure rides probably this is not a good amusement parks brilliant for less than ten year old kids except one or two rides rest are not adventures i think disney needs to reinvent themselves i had a very high expectations but felt it is not the best,3,2017-05-23
5775,Ddissapointment,rides mostly designed for children adults looking for amusement may struggle to get full expierence some rides are quite fun but you need to stand in long lines and the place is crawded selfie stick is borbidden inside and they will either take it away from you at the security search if found on you or if inside the park staff will ask you to either give them the stick or either to leave the park i mean forbidden not during the rides but while walking around the park seems they are not happy if you are not buying pictures taken by their photographers ,2,2017-05-22
5776,A magical place!,i ve been to disney world before so i had expectations going in while on a slightly smaller scale disneyland had all of the wonder and magic tips for a visit include learning about the fast pass system and using it until about pm on an average weekday by then they were pretty well used up hit adventure land early to get three big rides before the lines get long and enjoy the magic ,5,2017-05-21
5777,Skip the crowds,i am an avid disney goer and go at least once every few weeks or whenever i have time a few tips for people splurge on the front of the line passes especially on weekends or in the summer you may have to come back at a different time but it beats waiting in a hr line in the sweltering heat go in january it s less crowded in the park and you get better chances of going on all your favorite rides more than once even pull anything and everything they tell you not to pull when in line for indiana jones they have fun sound effects that are just amassing to everyone don t want to get wet on splash mountain sit in the fourth seat to avoid most if not all the water,5,2017-05-20
5778,Great day with infants,we had a great day with our month old twins you can use fastpass to ride some of the rides without waiting time and no height limit we went to the haunted mansion buzz lightyear roger rabbit and also some of the rides only had m wait winnie the pooh pinocchio and it s a small world the twins loved the rides loved the shows it was all in all a pretty cool day i only disliked how packed it was even though it weren t holidays and it was during a week day it was really crowded to the point of annoying ,5,2017-05-20
5779,We enjoyed,we always have a great time at disneyland it would be nice if the characters were not rushed away though ,5,2017-05-20
5780,Over crowded,i picked the wrong time to go it seemed to have lost some of its magic the train was down due to adding on to the park that made the walking areas difficult if people would have stayed to the right when walking and step off to the side when stopping the flow would be better and if people would realize that a stroller or a wheel chair can not just stop when someone steps out in front that would be helpful my complaints are with the guests in the park not the park i m amazed at how people can be the characters are always great they interact with everyone and that makes it special they put the magic in the park disney tends to leave out information on things the aladin oasis meal with a ticket for the show does not necessarily mean you have a good viewing of it but a place to stand in an area the price on the meal was not worth it it was for adults and child then when we got to the area we could not see if they would have people sit we all would be able to see it could of been more organized was disappointed you use to be able to get a birthday cake brought to your table at selected restraunts there when i called they did not do it any more or know much about it we have always loved going to disneyland however this trip lost a lot of the magic i think walt disney would be disappointed be kind to the staff they put up with a lot all day and seem to hold it together ,4,2017-05-19
5781,"Not quite magical, but had a good day",went on a monday in the hopes that it would be less busy but it ended up being the day after the park was closed for the marathons so the place was rammed took us over an hour just to get from the car park through bag check on the shuttle buying tickets and into the park we did have fun but the waits for rides without the fast pass system were way too long and i don t understand why more rides don t have it like pirates of the caribbean which is the most popular also the indiana jones ride was shut when we went which was annoying as we weren t even given the heads up and it wasn t marked on the map so we wasted our time walking over there to get a fast pass at the start kudos to disney for having lots of vegan food on offer though the pineapple dole whip was incredible and the mickey pretzels ,4,2017-05-18
5782,Better than Walt Disney World,disneyland is better than it s orlando counterpart i grew up in orlando so everywhere i went i saw disney when it comes to the parks though disneyland is much better for starters its not as humid as the harsh florida weather the lines aren t nearly as long and even the cast members seem happier and even though a lot of the rides are the same or similar disneyland offers rides such as indiana jones and who framed roger rabbit that walt disney world does not have ,5,2017-05-18
5783,Returning as an adult,i visited disneyland a lot as a child so i had high expectations returning here as an adult with my spouse parents and brother disney did not disappoint they put so much effort into making every detail of disneyland and its newer sibling california adventure park perfect and it really shows the smaller attractions like the jungle cruise are just as well managed as the marquee rides like space mountain i highly recommend disneyland for families of all ages while you can see disneyland in one day i recommend two days if you plan on visiting california adventure park too three days would allow you to see both parks at a more relaxed pace be sure to bring comfy shoes and have fun ,5,2017-05-18
5784,Best Disney park so far,do not miss the frozen show in adventure park loved all the other performances parades and acts by characters ,5,2017-05-18
5785,Disneyland delight,simply the happiest place on earth walking through the turnstiles frees for a day of delight wandering through all areas plus take time to enjoy the many rides for both children and adults lost in a world of enjoyment and happiness ,5,2017-05-17
5786,Birthday,it wasn t worth the money over crowded did get to see many characters the ones my kid got to sign her book was at the character breakfast only didn t get on but two rides because of the time waiting hour in the half each wait it was not fun at all i wish i never paid my money but the character breakfast was outstanding ,1,2017-05-17
5787,Disney .... A victim of their success,i have had been blessed to go to disneyland many times and i can tell you it has became a victim of their own success i have never been in line when i have experienced so many attractions shutting down as this last trip we were fortunate to go on a thursday so we were able to ride most of the rides that the family wanted to but not like the old days when it was lets do this ride multiple times it was let pick the one we want to make it on and ride them and then hope to get back on the ones the kids liked the best i will warn you the place has turned into attack of the stroller they are everywhere and many times i found that the stroller parking was creating a bottle neck so that movement was difficult for the price that you pay to get into the park now days it is becoming a hard decision as to if i would do it again my kids are and i felt it was important to take the little ones while they were young enough to enjoy the magic but could take advantage of all most of the attractions i hope this is not my last time but to be honest it may just well have as disney just keeps on increasing the cost and the fact that you can no longer do the park in a day makes it a hard sale plan wisely if you can go in an off peak time do so use the app service touring plans it will help you see more of the park and is interactive so you get some pretty accurate wait times be prepared to stand in lines for everything and i mean everything ,3,2017-05-17
5788,Disneyland trip,lots of fun with most rides open during this time of year the crowds were reasonable and the fireworks display was awesome ,5,2017-05-17
5789,Happiest place on earth,went days and enjoyed myself each day park does get busy so do your research and invest in the app and get fast passes splash mountain and hyperspace mountain are always winners buzz light year and star tours are heaps of fun matterhorn and well you get the idea overall this was amazing a hint if you have kids between get there early and sign them up for jedi training it s pretty cool ,5,2017-05-17
5790,Overcrowded!,we were disappointed in how crowded it was touring plans predicted a out of day by pm you could barely walk around the park and ride lines were all at least hour i would hate to see a day ,3,2017-05-16
5791,Not worth it. Go to Universal Studios instead!,the last time i went to disneyland was yrs ago before this visit i had refrained from visisting because i was truly hoping they would do some upkeep painting etc but im afraid nothing has chnaged since the last time i visited except the ridiculous price go to universal studios disneyland is old and tired and needs to close to majorly renovate everything ,2,2017-05-16
5792,birthday retirement celebration,quite a few people always clean restrooms are very clean and are easy to find rides are fun but again lines take up lot of your time ,5,2017-05-16
5793,Must go,absolutely amazing place mist visit at least once in a lifetime pros everything the queues lines waiting period crowd all worth the experience of disneyland cons long queues to security entry ticket rides well lets say for everything merchandise is expensive inside disney ,5,2017-05-16
5794,Nothing beats Disney!,this park is the best amusement park in the world that is why i continue to come back year after year what a magical experience ,5,2017-05-16
5795,Love Disney,disneyland is always a great place to visit their cast members are friendly every now and then i will run into a cast member that looks unhappy but once i talk with them they have a smile on their face park is very clean ,5,2017-05-15
5796,It All Started With A Mouse,i was super excited to see where the disney theme park world started as a frequent disney world visitor and the park didn t disappoint i loved riding some new rides that can t be found in orlando rides like matterhorn snow white pinocchio etc and i especially loved comparing rides in both places i found i liked thunder mountain railroad at disney land while i like splash mountain in orlando better for example the park was very busy because of the tinkerbell race weekend and mother s day but it was still enjoyable i wish they had a better fastpass system and more photopass photographers but overall it was great the food was your standard theme park fair although you can t go wrong with a disneyland churo or a dole whip it s a good thing i ran the race to enjoy the pretty unhealthy food found throughout the park ,5,2017-05-15
5797,First vacation,our group was a total of people ranging from yrs to yrs old this was our first official disneyland vacation we did a total of days california adventure day disneyland days we all a blast it was absolutely the best time other than the long lines for some rides it was still great but we would recommend that you make time for breaks as you will be walking standing alot in lines all in all we will be back next year but for maybe days since the younger ones loved it ,5,2017-05-13
5798,The original and the best!,the security can cause big delays and to be quite frank wouldn t be hard for a baddie to fool so frustrating that they didn t have a separate line for those without bags nonetheless once in it s all fantastic ,5,2017-05-13
5799,Classic!,it s disneyland so full of minute details and fun for everyone the only drawback is the lines minutes for the matterhorn do the fastpass ,5,2017-05-10
5800,Longest lines on earth?,disneyland s lines are simply outrageously long disneyland at the least needs to establish express check in stations each morning where if you already have been issued a ticket from a previous day and had your photo taken and signed in you can bypass the long long line to enter the park each day this feature would not be that hard to create and could save minutes or more a day you can t fast pass everything but still some of the other more popular rides like peter pan s flight desperately need to have fast pass options created too disneyland is becoming a victim of its own success and lately i see no non busy seasons there sadly happiest place on earth is being replace by the longest lines on earth in my most recent visit it was also disappointing that my magic morning was anything but when it took so long to stand in line to enter the park and then the one ride on my party s top priority agenda hyperspace mountain was not open until much later that morning ,3,2017-05-07
5801,Happiest place on earth...,i love seeing our kids with the big smile lines can be long but you can avoid some by making use of the fastpass rider swap and single rider lane check the disneyland website to see which rides have any of the above i would recommend getting fastpass for hyperspace mountain as well as star tours for lunch or dinner try the fried chicken at plaza inn ,5,2017-05-06
5802,Love Disneyland!,it is the most wonderful place to be walking through the main street of disneyland makes happy i always enjoy looking into all the shops to check out what s new to buy ,5,2017-05-06
5803,Vacation with son after bootcamp,disneyland was special we only had one day and it was dapper day it was fun to see everyone dressed up it was a very busy day for a sunday but the wait time fofor the rides we went on weren t bad maybe mins at the most alday the river boat wasn t running because of the construction of the new starwars land that open sometime check disney s web site for more info oh and the matterhorn bobsleds were off line as well we got to ride e erythierything else we wanted to and got to see some new things,5,2017-05-06
5804,Two half days at Didneyland,we were able to take advantage of the local resident three day pass and used two half days at disneyland five hours was just about enough the first day started in the morning and took advantage getting into the park an hour early although you are only permitted to visit tomorrowland and fantasyland until ,5,2017-05-06
5805,Still great,happiest place on earth still rings true today extremely expensive but once every few years it s great to take the kids on a road trip rides are on good shape but some of the value is gone due to the star wars expansion shutting down areas rides and show combined with ticket prices all ways going up food is still not worth what you pay for it but leaving the park cost you more when factoring the price you paid to be there ,4,2017-05-06
5806,Fun day and cheaper than Universal Studios,we did not buy our tickets in advance and spent for people we went to space mountain start wars right away and the line was only minutes or so beware if you smoke there are two smoking sections both marked in teeny tiny print on the map one in tomorrowland and the other over by frontierland the matterhorn was closed but we rode most of the other rides except the water one can t remember its name the tangled show was pretty funny and the mickey sounds parade was fun probably more so than the electric light but we saw both and enjoyed them if you want the best salad ever go the hungry bear nice chunks of turkey cranberries strawberries spinach jicama nuts and it was only about i think it was in frontierland the mickey shaped pretzels are pretty good and the food was not as overpriced as i expected space mountain and star tours were both pretty fun the buzz lightyear ride has you completing against your ride mate for points in battling zurg so that was fun even for teens and adults overall it was crowded but not too overwhelming fantasyland closes up in anticipation of the parades and fireworks so next time i would do all those rides earlier in the day husband hated it s a small world but the yo yo and yo st visit for all of them all thought it was charming i like how they ve added updates to that figures from some newer movies and the submarine ride some nemo animation none of the ride lines were longer than minutes and a lot of them like pirates and haunted mansion thunder railroad were all shorter no fireworks that night because the cloud cover was too low ,4,2017-05-05
5807,Enjoyed Day but.............,really enjoyed day but was very disappointed that we would consistently join a line to then be told the machine had broken down and to come back later even after standing in line for approximately to minutes this happened times during our one day visit on major rides this is very frustrating and annoying when spending a lot of money ,3,2017-05-05
5808,As fun as they say - even with the lines!,its amazing to spend hours at a place of which the majority of the time is spent in queues waiting to get into rides and still enjoy yourself but we did love the disneyland app which accurately reflects waiting times and also the pin trading which made the long walks between rides more fun ,5,2017-05-03
5809,Disneyland- the magic of managing waiting time and queuing that we payed a fortune!,yes it is magical yes our daughter loved it but the price in few years doubled and so has the crowd we stayed hours and managed to do atractions some of them a simple photo with mickey or minute winney the poo ride that we waited minutes for so one attraction per hour and it was monday i cannot even imgine what a jungle that place is on weekends yes park is amazing fun but the price of tickets and food inside is a pure rip off of poor parents who are fulfilling their kids dreams it is a bit disappointing to spend hours winding in a queue for plus other expenses per family other than that those few minutes in the rides and attrations were amazing ,3,2017-05-03
5810,"Fun, but...",the kids loved disneyland but it was so crowded and we went during a tuesday but with the rain and chasing around characters for a picture and autograph took too much time we just went on rides that we had fast passes for it was just too crowded ,3,2017-05-03
5811,The best theme park of them all,i took my wife here for her birthday and we had a great time i hadn t been here in thirty years and had forgotten how much fun this is the staff here run this like a swiss clock it was incredibly busy but the lines moved quickly and the fast pass was a great option to avoid some lines in a hour day we were able to get through rides including the very popular ones eat lunch and dinner shop for souvenirs watch the fire works and watch the electric light parade the park was incredibly clean and i found the staff to provide excellent service at every turn i don t think i will wait another thirty years before i return ,5,2017-05-03
5812,Best trip ever,i always say best trip ever but this was always something new and fun every trip but the classics shine i was fortunate this time as i got to go to club in dl and club in dca johnny depp was jack sparrow in person inside the pirate ride the magic lives ,5,2017-05-02
5813,Magical,what can you say about disneyland kids were in awe i think it was everything they dreamed it would be they did the jedi training i enjoyed the turkey legs ,5,2017-05-02
5814,Long Lines but AMAZING fun for teens and adults!,we waited minutes for some of the popular rides like indiana jones space mountain and the haunted mansion but in hours that day were able to go on at least rides highly recommend you book your restaurant reservation in advance of coming to park for example on friday by pm every restaurant was booked the bayou bay restaurant is underground in the dark located on the the pirates of the caribbean ride wished we would have reserved this one the tikki tikki room and its a small world are classic favorites that even my teenagers liked if you can t decide for a day trip between california adventures or disneyland i would recommend going to disneyland my teens really liked it and didn t mind the lines too much everything is so clean and stores are packed with creative gifts staff is not as friendly eg taming the parade lines at night so get in line at least hour early for night parade or you won t have a good view the pm parade is packed but the pm parade is not as packed with people we didn t pay the extra for the fastpass but if you have the i d recommend it to save time in the lines ,5,2017-05-02
5815,Disneyland - a magical place,spent days mid april at the disneyland resort with my granddaughter and family we had a great time there be sure to have a plan before hitting the parks to make the best use of your time and grab fast passes when you can park was busy but not anything like during the summer months weather was warm and pleasant year old loved the rides especially haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean unfortunately she was too short for radiator springs racers always next time but she rode everything she could possibly ride and she had a great time was so fun watching her expression on rides and listening to her excitedly telling us all about each ride as she exited booked a character breakfast breakfast with minnie and friends at the plaza inn and saw took pictures with many characters truly worth the cost stayed at hyatt place outside of disneyland which was very quiet and clean they even had complimentary breakfast and an underground parking lot no hot cars used anaheim resort transit art to get around be sure to get a dole whip outside of the tiki room and a chocolate caramel marshmallow wand on main street disneyland truly a magical place for the child in us all ,4,2017-05-02
5816,Happiest place on earth,i ve been here times and all different circumstances we came with a you child young teenager and young adult they all lit up upon entering the gates it really is magical so much more than words can describe i d give it stars out of if i could ,5,2017-05-01
5817,Better than Disney World,we have been to both disney parks and this is much better the rides are a lot closer it is not as crowded and it doesn t require a week if you are getting a fast pass get one for indiana jones or space mountain first because the lines get very long the corndogs around the park are awesome one of my favorite foods we stayed at holiday inn express outside of disneyland which was very nice and clean for dinner we left the park and ordered a pizza to our room took a nap and then went back to the park later in the evening around the park is empty after many families with young children have left we debated going because our sons are in high school and junior high but both enjoyed going ,4,2017-05-01
5818,So many people.,magical yes delightful yes but the waiting time killed it all i guess all i can say is be smart put one parent in line while the other one entertains yes disneyland is the happiest place on earth but be prepared to spend multiple days there otherwise you won t get all the magic we spent one day my son who is had a blast waiting time meant nothing to him but still we only got threw rides we needed more time ,4,2017-05-01
5819,Incredibly crowded for an April Saturday,waits without the fastpass were over an hour long for almost every attraction in the park we tackled the cars ride for the first ride of the day minute wait even though we got in line at they seemed to allow many many more fastpass holders than the ones in the stand by line maybe they ought to rethink the criteria for passing out as many of those things that they do ,3,2017-05-01
5820,Worth every penny for the smile on my daughter's face!,we live in the mid west but grew up in socal and still have family there we visited disneyland less than months ago and were hesitant to visit it again due to the price hours later it was worth every penny complain about the price if you will but simply imagine how busy it would be if they charged half the price you would wait over an hour for every single ride and you d barely be able to move around the place our daughter was years old the first time we brought her to disneyland and she had fun she was years old this time and easily had quadruple the fun and so did we we went on rides with her over a hour span and she had a blast on every single one that being said my wife and i have been to disney a number of times but had never been on the casey jr train ride we waited minutes to ride it this time and were less than impressed most minute waits at disneyland aren t bad this one is move feet then wait minutes move more feet wait more minutes i suggest skipping this ride unless your child demands you go on it while the parking seems like a hassle the first time you do it it s actually awesome the staff knows exactly what they re doing and have you in your parking spot in minutes on the shuttle in minutes and to the park in under minutes plus exiting is soooooo easy in your car and out of the lot in under minutes i visited disney years ago when it was one big parking lot and it was a nightmare entering and exiting it was easily minutes back in the day kudos to disney for figuring out an efficient system for so many to park we will definitely visit the park again in the future regardless of the price the smile on our daughter s face was worth every penny ,5,2017-04-29
5821,Not quite what we were expecting,after many visits to wdw we thought we d try disneyland it s smaller and more manageable than wdw but what a difference in attitude disney world is magical and immersive disneyland seems to be staffed with a bunch of lackadaisical californians who just see it as there job we also encountered a lot of line cutting one person waits in line and then family members join right before the character meet and greet this isn t tolerated at wdw and people are asked to go to the back of the line on our day at california adventure we bought our daughter minnie ears we left them tucked in the stroller so she could ride midway mania and someone stole them i ve never had anything stolen at a disney park luckily when i explained what happened to the nearest shop they replaced them for free our baby wipes were also stolen at the same time who steals baby wipes the bibbidi bobbidi boutique was its own mess as our appointment started minutes late but once it finally got started everything went smoothly i highly recommend the highest package because your child will get the skip to the front of the princess line through the staff entrance and meet all the princesses after she s become one herself it was wonderful overall the best i can say about our experience is that the weather was great the classic rides were also fun once you get past the less than magical disneyland vs disney world experience and accept dl for the more simple experience it is it s fine but now that i ve visited both within a year i m just more of a disney world person i ll take a scheduled fastpass that i can schedule on my phone any day compared to waiting in line for almost everything ,3,2017-04-28
5822,Christmas time experience,soooo much fun having the disney experience around christmas time the parades were awesome and all the yummy christmad desserts can t wait for this year ,5,2017-04-27
5823,Such fun nostalgia for those who grew up with it!,as a kid i loved the rides remember the e ticket as a young adult more of the same then i didn t care much for a while now i absolutely love this place whenever i walk under the plaque over the entrance i get just a little bit choked up here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday tomorrow and fantasy and it s true where else do you see people of all kinds from cute little kids to gaggles of tourists to big tatted up dudes who would seem scary in a dark alley all grinning like idiots and having a great time whether i go on a ride or not i just like soaking up the happy atmosphere it can get overcrowded at peak times and i really recommend avoiding it then unless you are a diehard fan but the rest of the time it is so fun morning and late at night are the best times if you want to avoid crowds i also highly recommend a multi day pass so you can sample a bit and then leave for a while then come back if you try to do it all at once it can be overwhelming enjoy ,5,2017-04-25
5824,The magic is not that magic!,i brought my two daughters for the third time prior two in disney world orlando after all these visits i still feel the disney experience is so so long lines who wants to spend min waiting for a min ride a lot of things feel rushed and not personalized fastpass was not working in a couple of stations food and drinks are expensive we had to eat standing up not even a piece of grass to sit down and relax we really didn t feel as guests neither my wife nor i plan to come back based on our experiences i m not sure that my daughters look forward to return either sorry to spoil the magic ,3,2017-04-23
5825,Great fun!,this is the first time i ve been here i loved tomorrowland with hyperspace mountain and the star tours ride the lines went decently fast i was disappointed that the fireworks show was cancelled but everything else was great my kids had a very good time the food overall was very good ,5,2017-04-23
5826,Disneyland Park,if you want to spend a ridiculous amount of money to be around an enormous crowd you better off going to the orlando park i would not recommend this park unless your on the west making the travel cheaper we will not be back ,2,2017-04-22
5827,"5 stars, would ride again!!!",this trip was our second visit years since the first this time with three kids in tow we had a blast with four day park hopper passes we could come and go between parks as we pleased ride highlights were definitely splash mountain and thunder mountain railroad in disney and california screamin our year old couldn t get enough soarin and radiator springs in california adventure pin swapping and character visits were also a highlight for the younger kids you have to admire their ability to stay in character disney parades and fireworks were worth the late nights as was the world of colour show in ca food was overall great with the only bad experience being burgers at ca next to soarin avoid food highlights were bengal barbeque in disney and boardwalk pizza and pasta in ca we will have to come back for the new star wars land ,5,2017-04-22
5828,Like a big comfort blanket!,i have just returned from a family holiday to la with a family from years to years i haven t been for years and it felt like a huge comfort blanket to return to with my parents and now my own children we visited on easter sunday and it was very quiet in the morning so i would recommend this day we loved all the favourite rides although we were a little disappointed that the bob sleds were closed the only slight disappointment was the blue bayou recommended in every guide book i thought it was a it expensive for what we had but a lovely location in the pirates of the caribbean ride would recommend disney to anyone x,5,2017-04-21
5829,Enchanting Experience,the last time we visited disneyland was a few years back and things have changed since then first and foremost is the security checkpoint there never was one unless you were entering one of the theme parks now you have the go through the checkpoint which connects both theme parks and downtown disney actually its not a bad idea because this way you don t have to be rechecked everytime you reenter one of the theme parks since childhood disneyland has pretty much remained the same other then maintaining their rides why change a good thing just walking down main street brings back alot of childhood memories i can smell the fresh popcorn and other confectionary delights wafting in the air to seeing the myriad of costumed disney characters and of course the sights and sounds just adds to the overall disney experience the hardest decision i always have to make is which way to go and which rides do i want to ride first after i ve made that decision everything else is easy all the famous rides have remained the same i e pirates of the caribbean its a small world to the haunted mansion to name just a few i ve never gotten bored with any of these rides and always looked forward to riding them on every visit of course this being spring break and according to a disney staff member there is over in attendance vying for the same rides as you fun fun fun now the long wait in lines the food here really hasn t changed other than the ridiculously high prices the food fills you but empties your wallet quickly the night is capped off with the electric light parade which literally draws thousands of people from all over the park just to watch this main event which leads me to my next question who s on the rides i guess this would be a great time to catch the rides because everyone is on main street watching the show although after the show there s a mass exodus out of the park overall come happy leave exhausted broke but happy ,5,2017-04-20
5830,A magical day at Disneyland,this was our rd trip to disneyland and every time is just as magical as our first visit the longest time we had to wait was minutes and on most we had no more than a min wait only downside was that the disneyland railroad was closed for maintenance ,5,2017-04-20
5831,Dance Tour,disney was as magical as ever and did not disappoint it was the busy easter period so lines were long but who cares it still is the happiest place on earth ,5,2017-04-20
5832,Just Disney!!,please note i am not a biggest fan of amusement parks lots of crowds super long lines and the food is the price of a star restaurant with the quality of a star place for me its a every year disneyland visit ,3,2017-04-18
